<pre xml:space="preserve">
     An editorial in the Louisville Courier-Journal, early in 1901, said:
     &ldquo;A remarkable transformation, or rather a development, has taken
     place in Mark Twain.  The genial humorist of the earlier day is now
     a reformer of the vigorous kind, a sort of knight errant who does
     not hesitate to break a lance with either Church or State if he
     thinks them interposing on that broad highway over which he believes
     not a part but the whole of mankind has the privilege of passing in
     the onward march of the ages.&rdquo;
 
     Mark Twain had begun &ldquo;breaking the lance&rdquo; very soon after his return
     from Europe.  He did not believe that he could reform the world, but
     at least he need not withhold his protest against those things which
     stirred his wrath.  He began by causing the arrest of a cabman who
     had not only overcharged but insulted him; he continued by writing
     openly against the American policy in the Philippines, the
     missionary propaganda which had resulted in the Chinese uprising and
     massacre, and against Tammany politics.  Not all of his efforts were
     in the line of reform; he had become a sort of general spokesman
     which the public flocked to hear, whatever the subject.  On the
     occasion of a Lincoln Birthday service at Carnegie Hall he was
     chosen to preside, and he was obliged to attend more dinners than
     were good for his health.  His letters of this period were mainly
     written to his old friend Twichell, in Hartford.  Howells, who lived
     in New York, he saw with considerable frequency.

     In the letter which follows the medicine which Twichell was to take
     was Plasmon, an English proprietary remedy in which Mark Twain had
     invested&mdash;a panacea for all human ills which osteopathy could not
     reach.

</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;Certainly. I used to take it in my coffee, but it settled
      to the bottom in the form of mud, and I had to eat it with a spoon; so I
      dropped the custom and took my 2 teaspoonfuls in cold milk after
      breakfast. If we were out of milk I shoveled the dry powder into my mouth
      and washed it down with water. The only essential is to get it down, the
      method is not important.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, blame it, I can&rsquo;t go to the Alumni dinner, Joe. It takes two days, and
      I can&rsquo;t spare the time. Moreover I preside at the Lincoln birthday
      celebration in Carnegie Hall Feb. 11, and I must not make two speeches so
      close together. Think of it&mdash;two old rebels functioning there&mdash;I
      as President, and Watterson as Orator of the Day! Things have changed
      somewhat in these 40 years, thank God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Look here&mdash;when you come down you must be our guest&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got a
      roomy room for you, and Livy will make trouble if you go elsewhere. Come
      straight to 14 West 10th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan. 24. Livy says Amen to that; also, can you give us a day or two&rsquo;s
      notice, so the room will be sure to be vacant?
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m going to stick close to my desk for a month, now, hoping to write a
      small book.

     The letter which follows is a fair sample of Mark Twain&rsquo;s private
     violence on a subject which, in public print, he could only treat
     effectively by preserving his good humor.  When he found it
     necessary to boil over, as he did, now and then, for relief, he
     always found a willing audience in Twichell.  The mention of his
     &ldquo;Private Philosophy&rdquo; refers to &lsquo;What Is Man?&rsquo;, privately published
     in 1906; reissued by his publishers in 1916.

    <p>
      To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                             14  W. 10th Jan.  29, &lsquo;01.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;I&rsquo;m not expecting anything but kicks for scoffing, and am
      expecting a diminution of my bread and butter by it, but if Livy will let
      me I will have my say. This nation is like all the others that have been
      spewed upon the earth&mdash;ready to shout for any cause that will tickle
      its vanity or fill its pocket. What a hell of a heaven it will be, when
      they get all these hypocrites assembled there!
    </p>
    <p>
      I can&rsquo;t understand it! You are a public guide and teacher, Joe, and are
      under a heavy responsibility to men, young and old; if you teach your
      people&mdash;as you teach me&mdash;to hide their opinions when they
      believe the flag is being abused and dishonored, lest the utterance do
      them and a publisher a damage, how do you answer for it to your
      conscience? You are sorry for me; in the fair way of give and take, I am
      willing to be a little sorry for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I seem to be going counter to my own Private Philosophy&mdash;which
      Livy won&rsquo;t allow me to publish&mdash;because it would destroy me. But I
      hope to see it in print before I die. I planned it 15 years ago, and wrote
      it in &lsquo;98. I&rsquo;ve often tried to read it to Livy, but she won&rsquo;t have it; it
      makes her melancholy. The truth always has that effect on people. Would
      have, anyway, if they ever got hold of a rag of it&mdash;Which they don&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are supposing that I am supposing that I am moved by a Large
      Patriotism, and that I am distressed because our President has blundered
      up to his neck in the Philippine mess; and that I am grieved because this
      great big ignorant nation, which doesn&rsquo;t know even the A B C facts of the
      Philippine episode, is in disgrace before the sarcastic world&mdash;drop
      that idea! I care nothing for the rest&mdash;I am only distressed and
      troubled because I am befouled by these things. That is all. When I search
      myself away down deep, I find this out. Whatever a man feels or thinks or
      does, there is never any but one reason for it&mdash;and that is a selfish
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      At great inconvenience, and expense of precious time I went to the chief
      synagogue the other night and talked in the interest of a charity school
      of poor Jew girls. I know&mdash;to the finest, shades&mdash;the selfish
      ends that moved me; but no one else suspects. I could give you the details
      if I had time. You would perceive how true they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ve written another article; you better hurry down and help Livy squelch
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She&rsquo;s out pottering around somewhere, poor housekeeping slave; and Clara
      is in the hands of the osteopath, getting the bronchitis pulled and hauled
      out of her. It was a bad attack, and a little disquieting. It came day
      before yesterday, and she hasn&rsquo;t sat up till this afternoon. She is
      getting along satisfactorily, now.
    </p>

                    Lots of love to you all.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Mark Twain&rsquo;s religion had to do chiefly with humanity in its present
     incarnation, and concerned itself very little with any possible
     measure of reward or punishment in some supposed court of the
     hereafter.  Nevertheless, psychic investigation always interested
     him, and he was good-naturedly willing to explore, even hoping,
     perhaps, to be convinced that individuality continues beyond death.
     The letter which follows indicates his customary attitude in
     relation to spiritualistic research.  The experiments here
     mentioned, however, were not satisfactory.

</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR MRS. McQUISTON,&mdash;I have never had an experience which moved me
      to believe the living can communicate with the dead, but my wife and I
      have experimented in the matter when opportunity offered and shall
      continue to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enclose a letter which came this morning&mdash;the second from the same
      source. Mrs. K&mdash;&mdash;is a Missourian, and lately she discovered, by
      accident, that she was a remarkable hypnotiser. Her best subject is a
      Missouri girl, Miss White, who is to come here soon and sustain strictly
      scientific tests before professors at Columbia University. Mrs. Clemens
      and I intend to be present. And we shall ask the pair to come to our house
      to do whatever things they can do. Meantime, if you thought well of it,
      you might write her and arrange a meeting, telling her it is by my
      suggestion and that I gave you her address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone has told me that Mrs. Piper is discredited. I cannot be sure, but
      I think it was Mr. Myers, President of the London Psychical Research
      Society&mdash;we heard of his death yesterday. He was a spiritualist. I am
      afraid he was a very easily convinced man. We visited two mediums whom he
      and Andrew Lang considered quite wonderful, but they were quite
      transparent frauds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clemens corrects me: One of those women was a fraud, the other not a
      fraud, but only an innocent, well-meaning, driveling vacancy.

     In Mark Twain&rsquo;s Bermuda chapters entitled Idle Notes of an Idle
     Excursion he tells of an old sea captain, one Hurricane Jones, who
     explained biblical miracles in a practical, even if somewhat
     startling, fashion.  In his story of the prophets of Baal, for
     instance, the old captain declared that the burning water was
     nothing more nor less than petroleum.  Upon reading the &ldquo;notes,&rdquo;
      Professor Phelps of Yale wrote that the same method of explaining
     miracles had been offered by Sir Thomas Browne.

     Perhaps it may be added that Captain Hurricane Jones also appears in
     Roughing It, as Captain Ned Blakely.

    <p>
      MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I was not aware that old Sir Thomas had anticipated
      that story, and I am much obliged to you for furnishing me the paragraph.
      It is curious that the same idea should leave entered two heads so unlike
      as the head of that wise old philosopher and that of Captain Ned Wakeman,
      a splendidly uncultured old sailor, but in his own opinion a thinker by
      divine right. He was an old friend of mine of many years&rsquo; standing; I made
      two or three voyages with him, and found him a darling in many ways. The
      petroleum story was not told to me; he told it to Joe Twichell, who ran
      across him by accident on a sea voyage where I think the two were the only
      passengers. A delicious pair, and admirably mated, they took to each other
      at once and became as thick as thieves. Joe was passing under a fictitious
      name, and old Wakeman didn&rsquo;t suspect that he was a parson; so he gave his
      profanity full swing, and he was a master of that great art. You probably
      know Twichell, and will know that that is a kind of refreshment which he
      is very capable of enjoying.

     For the summer Clemens and his family found a comfortable lodge in
     the Adirondacks&mdash;a log cabin called &ldquo;The Lair&rdquo;&mdash;on Saranac Lake.
     Soon after his arrival there he received an invitation to attend the
     celebration of Missouri&rsquo;s eightieth anniversary.  He sent the
     following letter:

    <p>
      To Edward L. Dimmitt, in St. Louis:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              AMONG THE ADIRONDACK LAKES, July 19, 1901.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR MR. DIMMITT,&mdash;By an error in the plans, things go wrong end
      first in this world, and much precious time is lost and matters of urgent
      importance are fatally retarded. Invitations which a brisk young fellow
      should get, and which would transport him with joy, are delayed and
      impeded and obstructed until they are fifty years overdue when they reach
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has happened again in this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I was a boy in Missouri I was always on the lookout for invitations
      but they always miscarried and went wandering through the aisles of time;
      and now they are arriving when I am old and rheumatic and can&rsquo;t travel and
      must lose my chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have lost a world of delight through this matter of delaying
      invitations. Fifty years ago I would have gone eagerly across the world to
      help celebrate anything that might turn up. IT would have made no
      difference to me what it was, so that I was there and allowed a chance to
      make a noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole scheme of things is turned wrong end to. Life should begin with
      age and its privileges and accumulations, and end with youth and its
      capacity to splendidly enjoy such advantages. As things are now, when in
      youth a dollar would bring a hundred pleasures, you can&rsquo;t have it. When
      you are old, you get it and there is nothing worth buying with it then.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s an epitome of life. The first half of it consists of the capacity to
      enjoy without the chance; the last half consists of the chance without the
      capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am admonished in many ways that time is pushing me inexorably along. I
      am approaching the threshold of age; in 1977 I shall be 142. This is no
      time to be flitting about the earth. I must cease from the activities
      proper to youth and begin to take on the dignities and gravities and
      inertia proper to that season of honorable senility which is on its way
      and imminent as indicated above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours is a great and memorable occasion, and as a son of Missouri I should

     In the foregoing Mark Twain touches upon one of his favorite
     fancies: that life should begin with old age and approach strong
     manhood, golden youth, to end at last with pampered and beloved
     babyhood.  Possibly he contemplated writing a story with this idea
     as the theme, but He seems never to have done so.

     The reader who has followed these letters may remember Yung Wing,
     who had charge of the Chinese educational mission in Hartford, and
     how Mark Twain, with Twichell, called on General Grant in behalf of
     the mission.  Yung Wing, now returned to China, had conceived the
     idea of making an appeal to the Government of the United States for
     relief of his starving countrymen.

    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;As you say, it is impracticable&mdash;in my case,
      certainly. For me to assist in an appeal to that Congress of land-thieves
      and liars would be to bring derision upon it; and for me to assist in an
      appeal for cash to pass through the hands of those missionaries out there,
      of any denomination, Catholic or Protestant, wouldn&rsquo;t do at all. They
      wouldn&rsquo;t handle money which I had soiled, and I wouldn&rsquo;t trust them with
      it, anyway. They would devote it to the relief of suffering&mdash;I know
      that&mdash;but the sufferers selected would be converts. The
      missionary-utterances exhibit no humane feeling toward the others, but in
      place of it a spirit of hate and hostility. And it is natural; the Bible
      forbids their presence there, their trade is unlawful, why shouldn&rsquo;t their
      characters be of necessity in harmony with&mdash;but never mind, let it
      go, it irritates me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later.... I have been reading Yung Wing&rsquo;s letter again. It may be that he
      is over-wrought by his sympathies, but it may not be so. There may be
      other reasons why the missionaries are silent about the Shensi-2-year
      famine and cannibalism. It may be that there are so few Protestant
      converts there that the missionaries are able to take care of them. That
      they are not likely to largely concern themselves about Catholic converts
      and the others, is quite natural, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      That crude way of appealing to this Government for help in a cause which
      has no money in it, and no politics, rises before me again in all its
      admirable innocence! Doesn&rsquo;t Yung Wing know us yet? However, he has been
      absent since &lsquo;96 or &lsquo;97. We have gone to hell since then. Kossuth couldn&rsquo;t
      raise 30 cents in Congress, now, if he were back with his moving
      Magyar-Tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am on the front porch (lower one&mdash;main deck) of our little bijou of
      a dwelling-house. The lake-edge (Lower Saranac) is so nearly under me that
      I can&rsquo;t see the shore, but only the water, small-pored with rain-splashes&mdash;for
      there is a heavy down-pour. It is charmingly like sitting snuggled up on a
      ship&rsquo;s deck with the stretching sea all around&mdash;but very much more
      satisfactory, for at sea a rain-storm is depressing, while here of course
      the effect engendered is just a deep sense of comfort and contentment. The
      heavy forest shuts us solidly in on three sides there are no neighbors.
      There are beautiful little tan-colored impudent squirrels about. They take
      tea, 5 p. m., (not invited) at the table in the woods where Jean does my
      typewriting, and one of them has been brave enough to sit upon Jean&rsquo;s knee
      with his tail curved over his back and munch his food. They come to
      dinner, 7 p. m., on the front porch (not invited). They all have the one
      name&mdash;Blennerhasset, from Burr&rsquo;s friend&mdash;and none of them
      answers to it except when hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been here since June 21st. For a little while we had some warm
      days&mdash;according to the family&rsquo;s estimate; I was hardly discommoded
      myself. Otherwise the weather has been of the sort you are familiar with
      in these regions: cool days and cool nights. We have heard of the hot wave
      every Wednesday, per the weekly paper&mdash;we allow no dailies to
      intrude. Last week through visitors also&mdash;the only ones we have had&mdash;Dr.
      Root and John Howells.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have the daily lake-swim; and all the tribe, servants included (but not
      I) do a good deal of boating; sometimes with the guide, sometimes without
      him&mdash;Jean and Clara are competent with the oars. If we live another
      year, I hope we shall spend its summer in this house.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have taken the Appleton country seat, overlooking the Hudson, at
      Riverdale, 25 minutes from the Grand Central Station, for a year,
      beginning Oct. 1, with option for another year. We are obliged to be close
      to New York for a year or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aug. 3rd. I go yachting a fortnight up north in a 20-knot boat 225 feet
      long, with the owner, (Mr. Rogers), Tom Reid, Dr. Rice, Col. A. G. Paine
      and one or two others. Judge Howland would go, but can&rsquo;t get away from
      engagements; Professor Sloane would go, but is in the grip of an illness.
      Come&mdash;will you go? If you can manage it, drop a post-card to me c/o
      H.H. Rogers, 26 Broadway. I shall be in New York a couple of days before
      we sail&mdash;July 31 or Aug. 1, perhaps the latter,&mdash;and I think I
      shall stop at the Hotel Grosvenor, cor. 10th St and 5th ave.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all send you and the Harmonies lots and gobs of love.

      DEAR JOE,&mdash;Just a word, to scoff at you, with your extravagant
      suggestion that I read the biography of Phillips Brooks&mdash;the very
      dullest book that has been printed for a century. Joe, ten pages of Mrs.
      Cheney&rsquo;s masterly biography of her fathers&mdash;no, five pages of it&mdash;contain
      more meat, more sense, more literature, more brilliancy, than that whole

     The assassination of President McKinley occurred September 6, 1901.
     Such an event would naturally stir Mark Twain to comment on human
     nature in general.  His letter to Twichell is as individual as it is
     sound in philosophy.  At what period of his own life, or under what
     circumstances, he made the long journey with tragic intent there is
     no means of knowing now.  There is no other mention of it elsewhere
     in the records that survive him.

                                   AMPERSAND, Tuesday, (Sept. 10, 1901)
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;It is another off day, but tomorrow I shall resume work to
      a certainty, and bid a long farewell to letter-scribbling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of the President looks decidedly hopeful, and we are all glad,
      and the household faces are much improved, as to cheerfulness. Oh, the
      talk in the newspapers! Evidently the Human Race is the same old Human
      Race. And how unjust, and unreflectingly discriminating, the talkers are.
      Under the unsettling effects of powerful emotion the talkers are saying
      wild things, crazy things&mdash;they are out of themselves, and do not
      know it; they are temporarily insane, yet with one voice they declare the
      assassin sane&mdash;a man who has been entertaining fiery and reason&mdash;debauching
      maggots in his head for weeks and months. Why, no one is sane, straight
      along, year in and year out, and we all know it. Our insanities are of
      varying sorts, and express themselves in varying forms&mdash;fortunately
      harmless forms as a rule&mdash;but in whatever form they occur an immense
      upheaval of feeling can at any time topple us distinctly over the
      sanity-line for a little while; and then if our form happens to be of the
      murderous kind we must look out&mdash;and so must the spectator.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ass with the unpronounceable name was probably more insane than usual
      this week or two back, and may get back upon his bearings by and by, but
      he was over the sanity-border when he shot the President. It is possible
      that it has taken him the whole interval since the murder of the King of
      Italy to get insane enough to attempt the President&rsquo;s life. Without a
      doubt some thousands of men have been meditating the same act in the same
      interval, but new and strong interests have intervened and diverted their
      over-excited minds long enough to give them a chance to settle, and
      tranquilize, and get back upon a healthy level again. Every extraordinary
      occurrence unsettles the heads of hundreds of thousands of men for a few
      moments or hours or days. If there had been ten kings around when Humbert
      fell they would have been in great peril for a day or more&mdash;and from
      men in whose presence they would have been quite safe after the excess of
      their excitement had had an interval in which to cool down. I bought a
      revolver once and travelled twelve hundred miles to kill a man. He was
      away. He was gone a day. With nothing else to do, I had to stop and think&mdash;and
      did. Within an hour&mdash;within half of it&mdash;I was ashamed of myself&mdash;and
      felt unspeakably ridiculous. I do not know what to call it if I was not
      insane. During a whole week my head was in a turmoil night and day fierce
      enough and exhausting enough to upset a stronger reason than mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      All over the world, every day, there are some millions of men in that
      condition temporarily. And in that time there is always a moment&mdash;perhaps
      only a single one when they would do murder if their man was at hand. If
      the opportunity comes a shade too late, the chances are that it has come
      permanently too late. Opportunity seldom comes exactly at the supreme
      moment. This saves a million lives a day in the world&mdash;for sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      No Ruler is ever slain but the tremendous details of it are ravenously
      devoured by a hundred thousand men whose minds dwell, unaware, near the
      temporary-insanity frontier&mdash;and over they go, now! There is a day&mdash;two
      days&mdash;three&mdash;during which no Ruler would be safe from perhaps
      the half of them; and there is a single moment wherein he would not be
      safe from any of them, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may take this present shooting-case six months to breed another
      ruler-tragedy, but it will breed it. There is at least one mind somewhere
      which will brood, and wear, and decay itself to the killing-point and
      produce that tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every negro burned at the stake unsettles the excitable brain of another
      one&mdash;I mean the inflaming details of his crime, and the lurid
      theatricality of his exit do it&mdash;and the duplicate crime follows; and
      that begets a repetition, and that one another one and so on. Every
      lynching-account unsettles the brains of another set of excitable white
      men, and lights another pyre&mdash;115 lynchings last year, 102 inside of
      8 months this year; in ten years this will be habit, on these terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the wild talk you see in the papers! And from men who are sane when
      not upset by overwhelming excitement. A U. S. Senator-Cullom&mdash;wants
      this Buffalo criminal lynched! It would breed other lynchings&mdash;of men
      who are not dreaming of committing murders, now, and will commit none if
      Cullom will keep quiet and not provide the exciting cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a District Attorney wants a law which shall punish with death attempts
      upon a President&rsquo;s life&mdash;this, mind you, as a deterrent. It would
      have no effect&mdash;or the opposite one. The lunatic&rsquo;s mind-space is all
      occupied&mdash;as mine was&mdash;with the matter in hand; there is no room
      in it for reflections upon what may happen to him. That comes after the
      crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the noise the attempt would make in the world that would breed the
      subsequent attempts, by unsettling the rickety minds of men who envy the
      criminal his vast notoriety&mdash;his obscure name tongued by stupendous
      Kings and Emperors&mdash;his picture printed everywhere, the trivialest
      details of his movements, what he eats, what he drinks; how he sleeps,
      what he says, cabled abroad over the whole globe at cost of fifty thousand
      dollars a day&mdash;and he only a lowly shoemaker yesterday!&mdash;like
      the assassin of the President of France&mdash;in debt three francs to his
      landlady, and insulted by her&mdash;and to-day she is proud to be able to
      say she knew him &ldquo;as familiarly as you know your own brother,&rdquo; and glad to
      stand till she drops and pour out columns and pages of her grandeur and
      her happiness upon the eager interviewer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing will check the lynchings and ruler-murder but absolute silence&mdash;the
      absence of pow-pow about them. How are you going to manage that? By
      gagging every witness and jamming him into a dungeon for life; by
      abolishing all newspapers; by exterminating all newspaper men; and by
      extinguishing God&rsquo;s most elegant invention, the Human Race. It is quite
      simple, quite easy, and I hope you will take a day off and attend to it,
      Joe. I blow a kiss to you, and am
    </p>

     When the Adirondack summer ended Clemens settled for the winter in
     the beautiful Appleton home at Riverdale-on-the-Hudson.  It was a
     place of wide-spreading grass and shade-a house of ample room.  They
     were established in it in time for Mark Twain to take an active
     interest in the New York elections and assist a ticket for good
     government to defeat Tammany Hall.

      XLI. LETTERS OF 1902. RIVERDALE. YORK HARBOR. ILLNESS OF MRS. CLEMENS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The year 1902 was an eventful one for Mark Twain. In April he received a
      degree of LL.D. from the University of Missouri and returned to his native
      State to accept it. This was his last journey to the Mississippi River.
      During the summer Mrs. Clemens&rsquo;s health broke down and illnesses of one
      sort or another visited other members of the family. Amid so much stress
      and anxiety Clemens had little time or inclination for work. He wrote not
      many letters and mainly somber ones. Once, by way of diversion, he worked
      out the idea of a curious club&mdash;which he formed&mdash;its members to
      be young girls&mdash;girls for the most part whom he had never seen. They
      were elected without their consent from among those who wrote to him
      without his consent, and it is not likely that any one so chosen declined
      membership. One selection from his letters to the French member, Miss
      Helene Picard, of St.-Die, France, will explain the club and present a
      side of Mask Twain somewhat different from that found in most of his
      correspondence.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              RIVERDALE-ON-THE-HUDSON, February 22, 1902.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR MISS HELENE,&mdash;If you will let me call you so, considering that
      my head is white and that I have grownup daughters. Your beautiful letter
      has given me such deep pleasure! I will make bold to claim you for a
      friend and lock you up with the rest of my riches; for I am a miser who
      counts his spoil every day and hoards it secretly and adds to it when he
      can, and is grateful to see it grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of that gold comes, like yourself, in a sealed package, and I can&rsquo;t
      see it and may never have the happiness; but I know its value without
      that, and by what sum it increases my wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a Club, a private Club, which is all my own. I appoint the Members
      myself, and they can&rsquo;t help themselves, because I don&rsquo;t allow them to vote
      on their own appointment and I don&rsquo;t allow them to resign! They are all
      friends whom I have never seen (save one), but who have written friendly
      letters to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the laws of my Club there can be only one Member in each country, and
      there can be no male Member but myself. Some day I may admit males, but I
      don&rsquo;t know&mdash;they are capricious and inharmonious, and their ways
      provoke me a good deal. It is a matter which the Club shall decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have made four appointments in the past three or four months: You as
      Member for France, a young Highland girl as Member for Scotland, a
      Mohammedan girl as Member for Bengal, and a dear and bright young niece of
      mine as Member for the United States&mdash;for I do not represent a
      country myself, but am merely Member at Large for the Human Race.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must not try to resign, for the laws of the Club do not allow that.
      You must console yourself by remembering that you are in the best of
      company; that nobody knows of your membership except myself&mdash;that no
      Member knows another&rsquo;s name, but only her country; that no taxes are
      levied and no meetings held (but how dearly I should like to attend one!).
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my Members is a Princess of a royal house, another is the daughter
      of a village book-seller on the continent of Europe. For the only
      qualification for Membership is intellect and the spirit of good will;
      other distinctions, hereditary or acquired, do not count.
    </p>
    <p>
      May I send you the Constitution and Laws of the Club? I shall be so
      pleased if I may. It is a document which one of my daughters typewrites
      for me when I need one for a new Member, and she would give her eyebrows
      to know what it is all about, but I strangle her curiosity by saying:
      &ldquo;There are much cheaper typewriters than you are, my dear, and if you try
      to pry into the sacred mysteries of this Club one of your prosperities
      will perish sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      My favorite? It is &ldquo;Joan of Arc.&rdquo; My next is &ldquo;Huckleberry Finn,&rdquo; but the
      family&rsquo;s next is &ldquo;The Prince and the Pauper.&rdquo; (Yes, you are right&mdash;I
      am a moralist in disguise; it gets me into heaps of trouble when I go
      thrashing around in political questions.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish you every good fortune and happiness and I thank you so much for
      your letter.
    </p>

      gave me; what a happiness it was to be under your roof again; etc., etc.&rdquo;
       See opening sentence of all translations of letters passing between Lord
      Roberts and Indian princes and rulers.]&mdash;From Bridgeport to New York;
      thence to home; and continuously until near midnight I wallowed and reeked
      with Jonathan in his insane debauch; rose immediately refreshed and fine
      at 10 this morning, but with a strange and haunting sense of having been
      on a three days&rsquo; tear with a drunken lunatic. It is years since I have
      known these sensations. All through the book is the glaze of a resplendent
      intellect gone mad&mdash;a marvelous spectacle. No, not all through the
      book&mdash;the drunk does not come on till the last third, where what I
      take to be Calvinism and its God begins to show up and shine red and
      hideous in the glow from the fires of hell, their only right and proper
      adornment. By God I was ashamed to be in such company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonathan seems to hold (as against the Arminian position) that the Man (or
      his Soul or his Will) never creates an impulse itself, but is moved to
      action by an impulse back of it. That&rsquo;s sound!
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, that of two or more things offered it, it infallibly chooses the one
      which for the moment is most pleasing to ITSELF. Perfectly correct! An
      immense admission for a man not otherwise sane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to that point he could have written chapters III and IV of my
      suppressed &ldquo;Gospel.&rdquo; But there we seem to separate. He seems to concede
      the indisputable and unshakable dominion of Motive and Necessity (call
      them what he may, these are exterior forces and not under the man&rsquo;s
      authority, guidance or even suggestion)&mdash;then he suddenly flies the
      logic track and (to all seeming) makes the man and not these exterior
      forces responsible to God for the man&rsquo;s thoughts, words and acts. It is
      frank insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think that when he concedes the autocratic dominion of Motive and
      Necessity he grants, a third position of mine&mdash;that a man&rsquo;s mind is a
      mere machine&mdash;an automatic machine&mdash;which is handled entirely
      from the outside, the man himself furnishing it absolutely nothing: not an
      ounce of its fuel, and not so much as a bare suggestion to that exterior
      engineer as to what the machine shall do, nor how it shall do it nor when.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that concession, it was time for him to get alarmed and shirk&mdash;for
      he was pointing straight for the only rational and possible next-station
      on that piece of road the irresponsibility of man to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he shirked. Shirked, and arrived at this handsome result:
    </p>
    <p>
      Man is commanded to do so-and-so. It has been ordained from the beginning
      of time that some men shan&rsquo;t and others can&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are to be blamed: let them be damned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy the Colonel very much, and shall enjoy the rest of him with an
      obscene delight.

     We have not heard of Joe Goodman since the trying days of &lsquo;90 and
     &lsquo;91, when he was seeking to promote the fortunes of the type-setting
     machine.  Goodman, meantime, who had in turn been miner, printer,
     publisher, and farmer; had been devoting his energies and genius to
     something entirely new: he had been translating the prehistoric
     Mayan inscriptions of Yucatan, and with such success that his work
     was elaborately published by an association of British scientists.
     In due time a copy of this publication came to Clemens, who was full
     of admiration of the great achievement.

    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;I am lost in reverence and admiration! It is now
      twenty-four hours that I have been trying to cool down and contemplate
      with quiet blood this extraordinary spectacle of energy, industry,
      perseverance, pluck, analytical genius, penetration, this irruption of
      thunders and fiery splendors from a fair and flowery mountain that nobody
      had supposed was a sleeping volcano, but I seem to be as excited as ever.
      Yesterday I read as much as half of the book, not understanding a word but
      enchanted nevertheless&mdash;partly by the wonder of it all, the study,
      the erudition, the incredible labor, the modesty, the dignity, the
      majestic exclusiveness of the field and its lofty remoteness from things
      and contacts sordid and mean and earthy, and partly by the grace and
      beauty and limpidity of the book&rsquo;s unsurpassable English. Science, always
      great and worshipful, goes often in hodden grey, but you have clothed her
      in garments meet for her high degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      You think you get &ldquo;poor pay&rdquo; for your twenty years? No, oh no. You have
      lived in a paradise of the intellect whose lightest joys were beyond the
      reach of the longest purse in Christendom, you have had daily and nightly
      emancipation from the world&rsquo;s slaveries and gross interests, you have
      received a bigger wage than any man in the land, you have dreamed a
      splendid dream and had it come true, and to-day you could not afford to
      trade fortunes with anybody&mdash;not even with another scientist, for he
      must divide his spoil with his guild, whereas essentially the world you
      have discovered is your own and must remain so.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is all just magnificent, Joe! And no one is prouder or gladder than
    </p>

               Yours always

     At York Harbor, Maine, where they had taken a cottage for the
     summer&mdash;a pretty place, with Howells not far distant, at Kittery
     Point&mdash;Mrs. Clemens&rsquo;s health gave way.  This was at a period when
     telegraphic communication was far from reliable.  The old-time
     Western Union had fallen from grace; its &ldquo;system&rdquo; no longer
     justified the best significance of that word.  The new day of
     reorganization was coming, and it was time for it.  Mark Twain&rsquo;s
     letter concerning the service at York Harbor would hardly be
     warranted today, but those who remember conditions of that earlier
     time will agree that it was justified then, and will appreciate its
     satire.

    </p>
    <p>
      To the President of The Western Union, in New York:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                             &ldquo;THE PINES&rdquo;
                                         YORK HARBOR, MAINE.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR SIR,&mdash;I desire to make a complaint, and I bring it to you, the
      head of the company, because by experience I know better than to carry it
      to a subordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been here a month and a half, and by testimony of friends,
      reinforced by personal experience I now feel qualified to claim as an
      established fact that the telegraphic service here is the worst in the
      world except that Boston.
    </p>
    <p>
      These services are actually slower than was the New York and Hartford
      service in the days when I last complained to you&mdash;which was fifteen
      or eighteen years ago, when telegraphic time and train time between the
      mentioned points was exactly the same, to-wit, three hours and a half. Six
      days ago&mdash;it was that raw day which provoked so much comment&mdash;my
      daughter was on her way up from New York, and at noon she telegraphed me
      from New Haven asking that I meet her with a cloak at Portsmouth. Her
      telegram reached me four hours and a quarter later&mdash;just 15 minutes
      too late for me to catch my train and meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      I judge that the telegram traveled about 200 miles. It is the best
      telegraphic work I have seen since I have been here, and I am mentioning
      it in this place not as a complaint but as a compliment. I think a
      compliment ought always to precede a complaint, where one is possible,
      because it softens resentment and insures for the complaint a courteous
      and gentle reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, there is a detail or two connected with this matter which ought
      perhaps to be mentioned. And now, having smoothed the way with the
      compliment, I will venture them. The head corpse in the York Harbor office
      sent me that telegram altho (1) he knew it would reach me too late to be
      of any value; (2) also, that he was going to send it to me by his boy; (3)
      that the boy would not take the trolley and come the 2 miles in 12
      minutes, but would walk; (4) that he would be two hours and a quarter on
      the road; (5) and that he would collect 25 cents for transportation, for a
      telegram which the he knew to be worthless before he started it. From
      these data I infer that the Western Union owes me 75 cents; that is to
      say, the amount paid for combined wire and land transportation&mdash;a
      recoup provided for in the printed paragraph which heads the
      telegraph-blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      By these humane and Christian stages we now arrive at the complaint
      proper. We have had a grave case of illness in the family, and a relative
      was coming some six hundred miles to help in the sick-room during the
      convalescing period. It was an anxious time, of course, and I wrote and
      asked to be notified as to the hour of the expected arrival of this
      relative in Boston or in York Harbor. Being afraid of the telegraph&mdash;which
      I think ought not to be used in times of hurry and emergency&mdash;I asked
      that the desired message be brought to me by some swift method of
      transportation. By the milkman, if he was coming this way. But there are
      always people who think they know more than you do, especially young
      people; so of course the young fellow in charge of this lady used the
      telegraph. And at Boston, of all places! Except York Harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was as usual; let me employ a statelier and exacter term, and
      say, historical.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dispatch was handed to the h. c. of the Boston office at 9 this
      morning. It said, &ldquo;Shall bring A. S. to you eleven forty-five this
      morning.&rdquo; The distance traveled by the dispatch is forty or fifty miles, I
      suppose, as the train-time is five minutes short of two hours, and the
      trains are so slow that they can&rsquo;t give a W. U. telegram two hours and
      twenty minutes start and overtake it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I have said, the dispatch was handed in at Boston at 9. The expected
      visitors left Boston at 9.40, and reached my house at 12 noon, beating the
      telegram 2 solid hours, and 5 minutes over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy brought the telegram. It was bald-headed with age, but still
      legible. The boy was prostrate with travel and exposure, but still alive,
      and I went out to condole with him and get his last wishes and send for
      the ambulance. He was waiting to collect transportation before turning his
      passing spirit to less serious affairs. I found him strangely intelligent,
      considering his condition and where he is getting his training. I asked
      him at what hour the telegram was handed to the h. c. in Boston. He
      answered brightly, that he didn&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      I examined the blank, and sure enough the wary Boston h. c. had
      thoughtfully concealed that statistic. I asked him at what hour it had
      started from Boston. He answered up as brightly as ever, and said he
      didn&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      I examined the blank, and sure enough the Boston h. c. had left that
      statistic out in the cold, too. In fact it turned out to be an official
      concealment&mdash;no blank was provided for its exposure. And none
      required by the law, I suppose. &ldquo;It is a good one-sided idea,&rdquo; I remarked;
      &ldquo;They can take your money and ship your telegram next year if they want to&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
      no redress. The law ought to extend the privilege to all of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy looked upon me coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I asked him when the telegram reached York Harbor. He pointed to some
      figures following the signature at the bottom of the blank&mdash;&ldquo;12.14.&rdquo;
       I said it was now 1.45 and asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that it reached your morgue an hour and a half ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was at that time half an hour too late to be of any use to me, if I
      wanted to go and meet my people&mdash;which was the case&mdash;for by the
      wording of the message you can see that they were to arrive at the station
      at 11.45. Why did, your h. c. send me this useless message? Can&rsquo;t he read?
      Is he dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the rules.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that does not account for it. Would he have sent it if it had been
      three years old, I in the meantime deceased, and he aware of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy didn&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, you know, a rule which required him to forward to the cemetery
      to-day a dispatch due three years ago, would be as good a rule as one
      which should require him to forward a telegram to me to-day which he knew
      had lost all its value an hour or two before he started it. The
      construction of such a rule would discredit an idiot; in fact an idiot&mdash;I
      mean a common ordinary Christian idiot, you understand&mdash;would be
      ashamed of it, and for the sake of his reputation wouldn&rsquo;t make it. What
      do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He replied with much natural brilliancy that he wasn&rsquo;t paid for thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gave me a better opinion of the commercial intelligence pervading his
      morgue than I had had before; it also softened my feelings toward him, and
      also my tone, which had hitherto been tinged with bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let bygones be bygones,&rdquo; I said, gently, &ldquo;we are all erring creatures,
      and mainly idiots, but God made us so and it is dangerous to criticise.&rdquo;

     One day there arrived from Europe a caller with a letter of
     introduction from Elizabeth, Queen of Rumania, better known as
     Carmen Sylva.  The visitor was Madam Hartwig, formerly an American
     girl, returning now, because of reduced fortunes, to find profitable
     employment in her own land.  Her husband, a man of high principle,
     had declined to take part in an &ldquo;affair of honor,&rdquo; as recognized by
     the Continental code; hence his ruin.  Elizabeth of Rumania was one
     of the most loved and respected of European queens and an author of
     distinction.  Mark Twain had known her in Vienna.  Her letter to him
     and his own letter to the public (perhaps a second one, for its date
     is two years later) follow herewith.

</pre>
    <p>
      HONORED MASTER,&mdash;If I venture to address you on behalf of a poor
      lady, who is stranded in Bucarest I hope not to be too disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hartwig left America at the age of fourteen in order to learn to sing
      which she has done thoroughly. Her husband had quite a brilliant situation
      here till he refused to partake &lsquo;dans une afaire onereuse&rsquo;, so it seems.
      They haven&rsquo;t a penny and each of them must try to find a living. She is
      very nice and pleasant and her school is so good that she most certainly
      can give excellent singing lessons.

    <p>
      I beg your pardon for being a bore to one I so deeply love and admire, to
      whom I owe days and days of forgetfulness of self and troubles and the
      intensest of all joys: Hero-worship! People don&rsquo;t always realize what a
      happiness that is! God bless you for every beautiful thought you poured

                      From Mark Twain to the Public:

                                                       Nov.  16, &lsquo;04.
</pre>
    <p>
      TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,&mdash;I desire to recommend Madame Hartwig to my
      friends and the public as a teacher of singing and as a concert-vocalist.
      She has lived for fifteen years at the court of Roumania, and she brought
      with her to America an autograph letter in which her Majesty the Queen of
      Roumania cordially certified her to me as being an accomplished and gifted
      singer and teacher of singing, and expressed a warm hope that her
      professional venture among us would meet with success; through absence in
      Europe I have had no opportunity to test the validity of the Queen&rsquo;s
      judgment in the matter, but that judgment is the utterance of an entirely
      competent authority&mdash;the best that occupies a throne, and as good as
      any that sits elsewhere, as the musical world well knows&mdash;and
      therefore back it without hesitation, and endorse it with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will explain that the reason her Majesty tried to do her friend a
      friendly office through me instead of through someone else was, not that I
      was particularly the right or best person for the office, but because I
      was not a stranger. It is true that I am a stranger to some of the
      monarchs&mdash;mainly through their neglect of their opportunities&mdash;but
      such is not the case in the present instance. The latter fact is a high
      compliment to me, and perhaps I ought to conceal it. Some people would.

      DEAR JOE,&mdash;It is ten days since Susy [Twichell] wrote that you were
      laid up with a sprained shoulder, since which time we have had no news
      about it. I hope that no news is good news, according to the proverb;
      still, authoritative confirmation of it will be gladly received in this
      family, if some of you will furnish it. Moreover, I should like to know
      how and where it happened. In the pulpit, as like as not, otherwise you
      would not be taking so much pains to conceal it. This is not a malicious
      suggestion, and not a personally-invented one: you told me yourself, once,
      that you threw artificial power and impressiveness into places in your
      sermons where needed, by &ldquo;banging the bible&rdquo;&mdash;(your own words.) You
      have reached a time of life when it is not wise to take these risks. You
      would better jump around. We all have to change our methods as the
      infirmities of age creep upon us. Jumping around will be impressive now,
      whereas before you were gray it would have excited remark.

     Such was the state of Mrs. Clemens&rsquo;s health that visitors
     were excluded from the sick room, and even Clemens himself
     was allowed to see her no more than a few moments at a time.
     These brief, precious visits were the chief interests of his
     long days.  Occasionally he was allowed to send her a few
     lines, reporting his occupations, and these she was
     sometimes permitted to answer.  Only one of his notes has
     been preserved, written after a day, now rare, of literary
     effort.  Its signature, the letter Y, stands for &ldquo;Youth,&rdquo;
      always her name for him.

      To Mrs. Clemens:

    <p>
      DEAR HEART,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve done another full day&rsquo;s work, and finished before
      4. I have been reading and dozing since and would have had a real sleep a
      few minutes ago but for an incursion to bring me a couple of unimportant
      letters. I&rsquo;ve stuck to the bed all day and am getting back my lost ground.
      Next time I will be strictly careful and make my visit very short&mdash;just
      a kiss and a rush. Thank you for your dear, dear note; you who are my own
      and only sweetheart.
    </p>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The reader may perhaps recall that H. H. Rogers, some five
     or six years earlier, had taken charge of the fortunes of
     Helen Keller, making it possible for her to complete her
     education.  Helen had now written her first book&mdash;a
     wonderful book&mdash;&lsquo;The Story of My Life&rsquo;, and it had been
     successfully published.  For a later generation it may be
     proper to explain that the Miss Sullivan, later Mrs. Macy,
     mentioned in the letter which follows, was the noble woman
     who had devoted her life to the enlightenment of this blind,
     dumb girl&mdash;had made it possible for her to speak and
     understand, and, indeed, to see with the eyes of luminous
     imagination.

     The case of plagiarism mentioned in this letter is not now
     remembered, and does not matter, but it furnished a text for
     Mark Twain, whose remarks on the subject in general are
     eminently worth while.

                                             ST.  PATRICK&rsquo;S DAY, &lsquo;03.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR HELEN,&mdash;I must steal half a moment from my work to say how glad
      I am to have your book, and how highly I value it, both for its own sake
      and as a remembrances of an affectionate friendship which has subsisted
      between us for nine years without a break, and without a single act of
      violence that I can call to mind. I suppose there is nothing like it in
      heaven; and not likely to be, until we get there and show off. I often
      think of it with longing, and how they&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;There they come&mdash;sit
      down in front!&rdquo; I am practicing with a tin halo. You do the same. I was at
      Henry Rogers&rsquo;s last night, and of course we talked of you. He is not at
      all well; you will not like to hear that; but like you and me, he is just
      as lovely as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am charmed with your book-enchanted. You are a wonderful creature, the
      most wonderful in the world&mdash;you and your other half together&mdash;Miss
      Sullivan, I mean, for it took the pair of you to make a complete and
      perfect whole. How she stands out in her letters! her brilliancy,
      penetration, originality, wisdom, character, and the fine literary
      competencies of her pen&mdash;they are all there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, dear me, how unspeakably funny and owlishly idiotic and grotesque was
      that &ldquo;plagiarism&rdquo; farce! As if there was much of anything in any human
      utterance, oral or written, except plagiarism! The kernel, the soul&mdash;let
      us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable
      material of all human utterances&mdash;is plagiarism. For substantially
      all ideas are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously drawn from a
      million outside sources, and daily used by the garnerer with a pride and
      satisfaction born of the superstition that he originated them; whereas
      there is not a rag of originality about them anywhere except the little
      discoloration they get from his mental and moral calibre and his
      temperament, and which is revealed in characteristics of phrasing. When a
      great orator makes a great speech you are listening to ten centuries and
      ten thousand men&mdash;but we call it his speech, and really some
      exceedingly small portion of it is his. But not enough to signify. It is
      merely a Waterloo. It is Wellington&rsquo;s battle, in some degree, and we call
      it his; but there are others that contributed. It takes a thousand men to
      invent a telegraph, or a steam engine, or a phonograph, or a photograph,
      or a telephone or any other important thing&mdash;and the last man gets
      the credit and we forget the others. He added his little mite&mdash;that
      is all he did. These object lessons should teach us that ninety-nine parts
      of all things that proceed from the intellect are plagiarisms, pure and
      simple; and the lesson ought to make us modest. But nothing can do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then why don&rsquo;t we unwittingly reproduce the phrasing of a story, as well
      as the story itself? It can hardly happen&mdash;to the extent of fifty
      words except in the case of a child: its memory-tablet is not lumbered
      with impressions, and the actual language can have graving-room there, and
      preserve the language a year or two, but a grown person&rsquo;s memory-tablet is
      a palimpsest, with hardly a bare space upon which to engrave a phrase. It
      must be a very rare thing that a whole page gets so sharply printed upon a
      man&rsquo;s mind, by a single reading, that it will stay long enough to turn up
      some time or other and be mistaken by him for his own. No doubt we are
      constantly littering our literature with disconnected sentences borrowed
      from books at some unremembered time and now imagined to be our own, but
      that is about the most we can do. In 1866 I read Dr. Holmes&rsquo;s poems, in
      the Sandwich Islands. A year and a half later I stole his dictation,
      without knowing it, and used it to dedicate my &ldquo;Innocents Abroad&rdquo; with.
      Then years afterwards I was talking with Dr. Holmes about it. He was not
      an ignorant ass&mdash;no, not he: he was not a collection of decayed human
      turnips, like your &ldquo;Plagiarism Court;&rdquo; and so when I said, &ldquo;I know now
      where I stole it, but whom did you steal it from,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
      remember; I only know I stole it from somebody, because I have never
      originated anything altogether myself, nor met anybody who had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To think of those solemn donkeys breaking a little child&rsquo;s heart with
      their ignorant rubbish about plagiarism! I couldn&rsquo;t sleep for blaspheming
      about it last night. Why, their whole lives, their whole histories, all
      their learning, all their thoughts, all their opinions were one solid ruck
      of plagiarism, and they didn&rsquo;t know it and never suspected it. A gang of
      dull and hoary pirates piously setting themselves the task of disciplining
      and purifying a kitten that they think they&rsquo;ve caught filching a chop! Oh,
      dam&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But you finish it, dear, I am running short of vocabulary today. Ever
      lovingly your friend,
    </p>

      (Edited and modified by Clara Clemens, deputy to her mother, who for more
      than 7 months has been ill in bed and unable to exercise her official
      function.)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The burden of the Clemens household had fallen almost entirely upon
     Clara Clemens.  In addition to supervising its customary affairs,
     she also shouldered the responsibility of an unusual combination of
     misfortunes, for besides the critical condition of her mother, her
     sister, Jean Clemens, was down with pneumonia, no word of which must
     come to Mrs. Clemens.  Certainly it was a difficult position.  In
     some account of it, which he set down later, Clemens wrote: &ldquo;It was
     fortunate for us all that Clara&rsquo;s reputation for truthfulness was so
     well established in her mother&rsquo;s mind.  It was our daily protection
     from disaster.  The mother never doubted Clara&rsquo;s word.  Clara could
     tell her large improbabilities without exciting any suspicion,
     whereas if I tried to market even a small and simple one the case
     would have been different.  I was never able to get a reputation
     like Clara&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
 
     The accumulation of physical ailments in the Clemens home had
     somewhat modified Mark Twain&rsquo;s notion of medical practice.  He was
     no longer radical; he had become eclectic.  It is a good deal of a
     concession that he makes to Twichell, after those earlier letters
     from Sweden, in which osteopathy had been heralded as the anodyne
     for all human ills.

      To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;Livy does really make a little progress these past 3 or 4
      days, progress which is visible to even the untrained eye. The physicians
      are doing good work with her, but my notion is, that no art of healing is
      the best for all ills. I should distribute the ailments around: surgery
      cases to the surgeons; lupus to the actinic-ray specialist; nervous
      prostration to the Christian Scientist; most ills to the allopath and the
      homeopath; (in my own particular case) rheumatism, gout and bronchial
      attacks to the osteopathist.

      Mr. Rogers was to sail southward this morning&mdash;and here is this

     It was through J. Y. M. MacAlister, to whom the next letter is
     written, that Mark Twain had become associated with the Plasmon
     Company, which explains the reference to &ldquo;shares.&rdquo;  He had seen much
     of MacAlister during the winter at Tedworth Square, and had grown
     fond of him.  It is a characteristic letter, and one of interesting
     fact.

      To J. Y. M. MacAlister, in London:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                                  RIVERDALE, NEW YORK.
                                                       April, 7, &lsquo;03.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR MACALISTER,&mdash;Yours arrived last night, and God knows I was glad
      to get it, for I was afraid I had blundered into an offence in some way
      and forfeited your friendship&mdash;a kind of blunder I have made so many
      times in my life that I am always standing in a waiting and morbid dread
      of its occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days ago I was in condition&mdash;during one horribly long night&mdash;to
      sympathetically roast with you in your &ldquo;hell of troubles.&rdquo; During that
      night I was back again where I was in the black days when I was buried
      under a mountain of debt. I called the daughters to me in private council
      and paralysed them with the announcement, &ldquo;Our outgo has increased in the
      past 8 months until our expenses are now 125 per cent. greater than our
      income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a mistake. When I came down in the morning a gray and aged wreck,
      and went over the figures again, I found that in some unaccountable way
      (unaccountable to a business man but not to me) I had multiplied the
      totals by 2. By God I dropped 75 years on the floor where I stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know it affected me as one is affected when he wakes out of a
      hideous dream and finds that it was only a dream. It was a great comfort
      and satisfaction to me to call the daughters to a private meeting of the
      Board again and say, &ldquo;You need not worry any more; our outgo is only a
      third more than our income; in a few months your mother will be out of her
      bed and on her feet again&mdash;then we shall drop back to normal and be
      all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly there is a blistering and awful reality about a well-arranged
      unreality. It is quite within the possibilities that two or three nights
      like that night of mine could drive a man to suicide. He would refuse to
      examine the figures; they would revolt him so, and he could go to his
      death unaware that there was nothing serious about them. I cannot get that
      night out of my head, it was so vivid, so real, so ghastly. In any other
      year of these 33 the relief would have been simple: go where you can cut
      your cloth to fit your income. You can&rsquo;t do that when your wife can&rsquo;t be
      moved, even from one room to the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clam spells the trained nurse afternoons; I am allowed to see Mrs. Clemens
      20 minutes twice a day and write her two letters a day provided I put no
      news in them. No other person ever sees her except the physician and now
      and then a nerve-specialist from New York. She saw there was something the
      matter that morning, but she got no facts out of me. But that is nothing&mdash;she
      hasn&rsquo;t had anything but lies for 8 months. A fact would give her a
      relapse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor and a specialist met in conspiracy five days ago, and in their
      belief she will by and by come out of this as good as new, substantially.
      They ordered her to Italy for next winter&mdash;which seems to indicate
      that by autumn she will be able to undertake the voyage. So Clara is
      writing a Florence friend to take a look round among the villas for us in
      the regions near that city. It seems early to do this, but Joan Bergheim
      thought it would be wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and his wife lunched with us here yesterday. They have been abroad in
      Havana 4 months, and they sailed for England this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am enclosing an order for half of my (your) Founders shares. You are not
      to refuse them this time, though you have done it twice before. They are
      yours, not mine, and for your family&rsquo;s sake if not your own you cannot in
      these cloudy days renounce this property which is so clearly yours and
      theirs. You have been generous long enough; be just, now to yourself. Mr.
      Rogers is off yachting for 5 or 6 weeks&mdash;I&rsquo;ll get them when he
      returns. The head of the house joins me in warmest greetings and
      remembrances to you and Mrs. MacAlister.
    </p>

      May 8. Great Scott! I never mailed this letter! I addressed it, put
      &ldquo;Registered&rdquo; on it&mdash;then left it lying unsealed on the arm of my
      chair, and rushed up to my bed quaking with a chill. I&rsquo;ve never been out
      of the bed since&mdash;oh, bronchitis, rheumatism, two sets of teeth
      aching, land, I&rsquo;ve had a dandy time for 4 weeks. And to-day&mdash;great
      guns, one of the very worst!...
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m devilish sorry, and I do apologise&mdash;for although I am not as slow
      as you are about answering letters, as a rule, I see where I&rsquo;m standing
      this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks ago Jean was taken down again&mdash;this time with measles, and
      I haven&rsquo;t been able to go to her and she hasn&rsquo;t been able to come to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Clemens is making nice progress, and can stand alone a moment or
      two at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I&rsquo;ll post this.

     The two letters that follow, though written only a few days apart,
     were separated in their arrival by a period of seven years.  The
     second letter was, in some way, mislaid and not mailed; and it was
     not until after the writer of it was dead that it was found and
     forwarded.

     Mark Twain could never get up much enthusiasm for the writings of
     Scott.  His praise of Quentin Durward is about the only approval he
     ever accorded to the works of the great romanticist.

</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR BRANDER,&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t been out of my bed for four weeks, but&mdash;well,
      I have been reading, a good deal, and it occurs to me to ask you to sit
      down, some time or other when you have 8 or 9 months to spare, and jot me
      down a certain few literary particulars for my help and elevation. Your
      time need not be thrown away, for at your further leisure you can make
      Colombian lectures out of the results and do your students a good turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Are there in Sir Walter&rsquo;s novels passages done in good English&mdash;English
      which is neither slovenly or involved?
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Are there passages whose English is not poor and thin and commonplace,
      but is of a quality above that?
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Are there passages which burn with real fire&mdash;not punk, fox-fire,
      make believe?
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Has he heroes and heroines who are not cads and cadesses?
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Has he personages whose acts and talk correspond with their characters
      as described by him?
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Has he heroes and heroines whom the reader admires, admires, and knows
      why?
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Has he funny characters that are funny, and humorous passages that are
      humorous?
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Does he ever chain the reader&rsquo;s interest, and make him reluctant to lay
      the book down?
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Are there pages where he ceases from posing, ceases from admiring the
      placid flood and flow of his own dilutions, ceases from being artificial,
      and is for a time, long or short, recognizably sincere and in earnest?
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Did he know how to write English, and didn&rsquo;t do it because he didn&rsquo;t
      want to?
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Did he use the right word only when he couldn&rsquo;t think of another one,
      or did he run so much to wrong because he didn&rsquo;t know the right one when
      he saw it?
    </p>
    <p>
      13. Can you read him? and keep your respect for him? Of course a person
      could in his day&mdash;an era of sentimentality and sloppy romantics&mdash;but
      land! can a body do it today?
    </p>
    <p>
      Brander, I lie here dying, slowly dying, under the blight of Sir Walter. I
      have read the first volume of Rob Roy, and as far as chapter XIX of Guy
      Mannering, and I can no longer hold my head up nor take my nourishment.
      Lord, it&rsquo;s all so juvenile! so artificial, so shoddy; and such wax figures
      and skeletons and spectres. Interest? Why, it is impossible to feel an
      interest in these bloodless shams, these milk-and-water humbugs. And oh,
      the poverty of the invention! Not poverty in inventing situations, but
      poverty in furnishing reasons for them. Sir Walter usually gives himself
      away when he arranges for a situation&mdash;elaborates, and elaborates,
      and elaborates, till if you live to get to it you don&rsquo;t believe in it when
      it happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can&rsquo;t find the rest of Rob Roy, I can&rsquo;t stand any more Mannering&mdash;I
      do not know just what to do, but I will reflect, and not quit this great
      study rashly. He was great, in his day, and to his proper audience; and so
      was God in Jewish times, for that matter, but why should either of them
      rank high now? And do they?&mdash;honest, now, do they? Dam&rsquo;d if I believe
      it.

    <p>
      DEAR BRANDER,&mdash;I&rsquo;m still in bed, but the days have lost their dulness
      since I broke into Sir Walter and lost my temper. I finished Guy Mannering&mdash;that
      curious, curious book, with its mob of squalid shadows jabbering around a
      single flesh-and-blood being&mdash;Dinmont; a book crazily put together
      out of the very refuse of the romance-artist&rsquo;s stage properties&mdash;finished
      it and took up Quentin Durward, and finished that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like leaving the dead to mingle with the living: it was like
      withdrawing from the infant class in the College of journalism to sit
      under the lectures in English literature in Columbia University.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wonder who wrote Quentin Durward?

     In 1903, preparations were going on for a great world&rsquo;s fair, to be
     held in St. Louis, and among other features proposed was a World&rsquo;s
     Literary Convention, with a week to be set apart in honor of Mark
     Twain, and a special Mark Twain Day in it, on which the National
     Association would hold grand services in honor of the distinguished

    <p>
      DEAR MR. GATTS,&mdash;It is indeed a high compliment which you offer me in
      naming an association after me and in proposing the setting apart of a
      Mark Twain day at the great St. Louis fair, but such compliments are not
      proper for the living; they are proper and safe for the dead only. I value
      the impulse which moves you to tender me these honors. I value it as
      highly as any one can, and am grateful for it, but I should stand in a
      sort of terror of the honors themselves. So long as we remain alive we are
      not safe from doing things which, however righteously and honorably
      intended, can wreck our repute and extinguish our friendships.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope that no society will be named for me while I am still alive, for I
      might at some time or other do something which would cause its members to
      regret having done me that honor. After I shall have joined the dead I
      shall follow the customs of those people and be guilty of no conduct that
      can wound any friend; but until that time shall come I shall be a doubtful
      quantity like the rest of our race.

      DEAR MR. GATTS,&mdash;While I am deeply touched by the desire of my
      friends of Hannibal to confer these great honors upon me, I must still
      forbear to accept them. Spontaneous and unpremeditated honors, like those
      which came to me at Hannibal, Columbia, St. Louis and at the village
      stations all down the line, are beyond all price and are a treasure for
      life in the memory, for they are a free gift out of the heart and they
      come without solicitations; but I am a Missourian and so I shrink from
      distinctions which have to be arranged beforehand and with my privity, for
      I then became a party to my own exalting. I am humanly fond of honors that
      happen but chary of those that come by canvass and intention. With sincere
      thanks to you and your associates for this high compliment which you have
      been minded to offer me, I am,

     We have seen in the letter to MacAlister that Mark Twain&rsquo;s wife had
     been ordered to Italy and plans were in progress for an
     establishment there.  By the end of June Mrs. Clemens was able to
     leave Riverdale, and she made the journey to Quarry Farm, Elmira,
     where they would remain until October, the month planned for their
     sailing.  The house in Hartford had been sold; and a house which,
     prior to Mrs. Clemens&rsquo;s breakdown they had bought near Tarrytown
     (expecting to settle permanently on the Hudson) had been let.  They
     were going to Europe for another indefinite period.

     At Quarry Farm Mrs. Clemens continued to improve, and Clemens, once
     more able to work, occupied the study which Mrs. Crane had built for
     him thirty years before, and where Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn and the
     Wandering Prince had been called into being.

    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;That love-letter delighted Livy beyond any like utterance
      received by her these thirty years and more. I was going to answer it for
      her right away, and said so; but she reserved the privilege to herself. I
      judge she is accumulating Hot Stuff&mdash;as George Ade would say....
    </p>
    <p>
      Livy is coming along: eats well, sleeps some, is mostly very gay, not very
      often depressed; spends all day on the porch, sleeps there a part of the
      night, makes excursions in carriage and in wheel-chair; and, in the matter
      of superintending everything and everybody, has resumed business at the
      old stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you ever go house-hunting 3,000 miles away? It costs three months of
      writing and telegraphing to pull off a success. We finished 3 or 4 days
      ago, and took the Villa Papiniano (dam the name, I have to look at it a
      minutes after writing it, and then am always in doubt) for a year by
      cable. Three miles outside of Florence, under Fiesole&mdash;a darling
      location, and apparently a choice house, near Fiske.
    </p>
    <p>
      There&rsquo;s 7 in our gang. All women but me. It means trunks and things. But
      thanks be! To-day (this is private) comes a most handsome voluntary
      document with seals and escutcheons on it from the Italian Ambassador (who
      is a stranger to me) commanding the Customs people to keep their hands off
      the Clemens&rsquo;s things. Now wasn&rsquo;t it lovely of him? And wasn&rsquo;t it lovely of
      me to let Livy take a pencil and edit my answer and knock a good third of
      it out?
    </p>
    <p>
      And that&rsquo;s a nice ship&mdash;the Irene! new&mdash;swift&mdash;13,000 tons&mdash;rooms
      up in the sky, open to sun and air&mdash;and all that. I was desperately
      troubled for Livy&mdash;about the down-cellar cells in the ancient
      &ldquo;Latin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cubs are in Riverdale, yet; they come to us the first week in August.

               With lots and lots of love to you all,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The arrangement for the Villa Papiniano was not completed, after
     all, and through a good friend, George Gregory Smith, a resident of
     Florence, the Villa Quarto, an ancient home of royalty, on the hills
     west of Florence, was engaged.  Smith wrote that it was a very
     beautiful place with a south-eastern exposure, looking out toward
     Valombrosa and the Chianti Hills.  It had extensive grounds and
     stables, and the annual rental for it all was two thousand dollars a
     year.  It seemed an ideal place, in prospect, and there was great
     hope that Mrs. Clemens would find her health once more in the
     Italian climate which she loved.

     Perhaps at this point, when Mark Twain is once more leaving America,
     we may offer two letters from strangers to him&mdash;letters of
     appreciation&mdash;such as he was constantly receiving from those among
     the thousands to whom he had given happiness.  The first is from
     Samuel Merwin, one day to become a popular novelist, then in the
     hour of his beginnings.

                                                       PLAINFIELD, N. J.
                                                       August 4, 1903.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR MR. CLEMENS,&mdash;For a good many years I have been struggling with
      the temptation to write you and thank you for the work you have done; and
      to-day I seem to be yielding.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the past two years I have been reading through a group of writers
      who seem to me to represent about the best we have&mdash;Sir Thomas
      Malory, Spenser, Shakespeare, Boswell, Carlyle, Le Sage. In thinking over
      one and then another, and then all of them together, it was plain to see
      why they were great men and writers: each brought to his time some new
      blood, new ideas,&mdash;turned a new current into the stream. I suppose
      there have always been the careful, painstaking writers, the men who are
      always taken so seriously by their fellow craftsmen. It seems to be the
      unconventional man who is so rare&mdash;I mean the honestly unconventional
      man, who has to express himself in his own big way because the
      conventional way isn&rsquo;t big enough, because ne needs room and freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have a group of the more or less conventional men now&mdash;men of
      dignity and literary position. But in spite of their influence and of all
      the work they have done, there isn&rsquo;t one of them to whom one can give
      one&rsquo;s self up without reservation, not one whose ideas seem based on the
      deep foundation of all true philosophy,&mdash;except Mark Twain.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope this letter is not an impertinence. I have just been turning about,
      with my head full of Spenser and Shakespeare and &ldquo;Gil Blas,&rdquo; looking for
      something in our own present day literature to which I could surrender
      myself as to those five gripping old writings. And nothing could I find
      until I took up &ldquo;Life on the Mississippi,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Huckleberry Finn,&rdquo; and,
      just now, the &ldquo;Connecticut Yankee.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t the first time I have read
      any of these three, and it&rsquo;s because I know it won&rsquo;t be the last, because
      these books are the only ones written in my lifetime that claim my
      unreserved interest and admiration and, above all, my feelings, that I&rsquo;ve
      felt I had to write this letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to think that &ldquo;Tom Sawyer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Huckleberry Finn&rdquo; will be looked
      upon, fifty or a hundred years from now, as the picture of buoyant,
      dramatic, human American life. I feel, deep in my own heart, pretty sure
      that they will be. They won&rsquo;t be looked on then as the work of a
      &ldquo;humorist&rdquo; any more than we think of Shakespeare as a humorist now. I
      don&rsquo;t mean by this to set up a comparison between Mark Twain and
      Shakespeare: I don&rsquo;t feel competent to do it; and I&rsquo;m not at all sure that
      it could be done until Mark Twain&rsquo;s work shall have its fair share of
      historical perspective. But Shakespeare was a humorist and so, thank
      Heaven! is Mark Twain. And Shakespeare plunged deep into the deep, sad
      things of life; and so, in a different way (but in a way that has more
      than once brought tears to my eyes) has Mark Twain. But after all, it
      isn&rsquo;t because of any resemblance for anything that was ever before written
      that Mark Twain&rsquo;s books strike in so deep: it&rsquo;s rather because they&rsquo;ve
      brought something really new into our literature&mdash;new, yet old as
      Adam and Eve and the Apple. And this achievement, the achievement of
      putting something into literature that was not there before, is, I should
      think, the most that any writer can ever hope to do. It is the one mark of
      distinction between the &ldquo;lonesome&rdquo; little group of big men and the vast
      herd of medium and small ones. Anyhow, this much I am sure of&mdash;to the
      young man who hopes, however feebly, to accomplish a little something,
      someday, as a writer, the one inspiring example of our time is Mark Twain.
      Very truly yours, SAMUEL MERWIN.

      MY DEAR, DEAR MARK TWAIN,&mdash;May a little girl write and tell you how
      dearly she loves and admires your writings? Well, I do and I want to tell
      you your ownself. Don&rsquo;t think me too impertinent for indeed I don&rsquo;t mean
      to be that! I have read everything of yours that I could get and parts
      that touch me I have read over and over again. They seem such dear friends
      to me, so like real live human beings talking and laughing, working and
      suffering too! One cannot but feel that it is your own life and experience
      that you have painted. So do not wonder that you seem a dear friend to me
      who has never even seen you. I often think of you as such in my own
      thoughts. I wonder if you will laugh when I tell you I have made a hero of
      you? For when people seem very sordid and mean and stupid (and it seems as
      if everybody was) then the thought will come like a little crumb of
      comfort &ldquo;well, Mark Twain isn&rsquo;t anyway.&rdquo; And it does really brighten me
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see I have gotten an idea that you are a great, bright spirit of
      kindness and tenderness. One who can twist everybody&rsquo;s-even your
      own-faults and absurdities into hearty laughs. Even the person mocked must
      laugh! Oh, Dear! How often you have made me laugh! And yet as often you
      have struck something infinite away down deep in my heart so that I want
      to cry while half laughing!
    </p>
    <p>
      So this all means that I want to thank you and to tell you. &ldquo;God always
      love Mark Twain!&rdquo; is often my wish. I dearly love to read books, and I
      never tire of reading yours; they always have a charm for me. Good-bye, I
      am afraid I have not expressed what I feel. But at least I have tried.

      DEAR DOUBLEDAY,&mdash;The books came&mdash;ever so many thanks. I have

      custom with Kipling&rsquo;s work-and saving up the rest for other leisurely and
      luxurious meals. A bell-buoy is a deeply impressive fellow-being. In these
      many recent trips up and down the Sound in the Kanawha&mdash;[Mr. Rogers&rsquo;s
      yacht.]&mdash;he has talked to me nightly, sometimes in his pathetic and
      melancholy way, sometimes with his strenuous and urgent note, and I got
      his meaning&mdash;now I have his words! No one but Kipling could do this

      XLIII. LETTERS OF 1904. TO VARIOUS PERSONS. LIFE IN VILLA QUARTO. DEATH OF
      MRS. CLEMENS. THE RETURN TO AMERICA.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Mrs. Clemens stood the voyage to Italy very well and, in due
     time, the family were installed in the Villa Reale di
     Quarto, the picturesque old Palace of Cosimo, a spacious,
     luxurious place, even if not entirely cheerful or always
     comfortable during the changeable Tuscan winter.
     Congratulated in a letter from MacAlister in being in the
     midst of Florentine sunshine, he answered: &ldquo;Florentine
     sunshine?  Bless you, there isn&rsquo;t any.  We have heavy fogs
     every morning, and rain all day.  This house is not merely
     large, it is vast&mdash;therefore I think it must always lack the
     home feeling.&rdquo;
 
     Neither was their landlady, the American wife of an Italian
     count, all that could be desired.  From a letter to
     Twichell, however, we learn that Mark Twain&rsquo;s work was
     progressing well.

                                                  VILLA DI QUARTO,
                                             FLORENCE, Jan. 7, &lsquo;04.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;... I have had a handsome success, in one way, here. I
      left New York under a sort of half promise to furnish to the Harper
      magazines 30,000 words this year. Magazining is difficult work because
      every third page represents 2 pages that you have put in the fire;
      (because you are nearly sure to start wrong twice) and so when you have
      finished an article and are willing to let it go to print it represents
      only 10 cents a word instead of 30.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this time I had the curious (and unprecedented) luck to start right in
      each case. I turned out 37,000 words in 25 working days; and the reason I
      think I started right every time is, that not only have I approved and
      accepted the several articles, but the court of last resort (Livy) has
      done the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      On many of the between-days I did some work, but only of an idle and not
      necessarily necessary sort, since it will not see print until I am dead. I
      shall continue this (an hour per day) but the rest of the year I expect to
      put in on a couple of long books (half-completed ones.) No more
      magazine-work hanging over my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      This secluded and silent solitude this clean, soft air and this enchanting
      view of Florence, the great valley and the snow-mountains that frame it
      are the right conditions for work. They are a persistent inspiration.
      To-day is very lovely; when the afternoon arrives there will be a new
      picture every hour till dark, and each of them divine&mdash;or progressing
      from divine to diviner and divinest. On this (second) floor Clara&rsquo;s room
      commands the finest; she keeps a window ten feet high wide open all the
      time and frames it in. I go in from time to time, every day and trade sass
      for a look. The central detail is a distant and stately snow-hump that
      rises above and behind blackforested hills, and its sloping vast
      buttresses, velvety and sun-polished with purple shadows between, make the
      sort of picture we knew that time we walked in Switzerland in the days of
      our youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I could show your letter to Livy&mdash;but she must wait a week or
      so for it. I think I told you she had a prostrating week of tonsillitis a
      month ago; she has remained very feeble ever since, and confined to the
      bed of course, but we allow ourselves to believe she will regain the lost
      ground in another month. Her physician is Professor Grocco&mdash;she could
      not have a better. And she has a very good trained nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love to all of you from all of us. And to all of our dear Hartford
      friends.

</pre>
    <p>
      P. S. 3 days later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Livy is as remarkable as ever. The day I wrote you&mdash;that night, I
      mean&mdash;she had a bitter attack of gout or rheumatism occupying the
      whole left arm from shoulder to fingers, accompanied by fever. The pains
      racked her 50 or 60 hours; they have departed, now&mdash;and already she
      is planning a trip to Egypt next fall, and a winter&rsquo;s sojourn there! This
      is life in her yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be surprised that I was willing to do so much magazine-writing&mdash;a
      thing I have always been chary about&mdash;but I had good reasons. Our
      expenses have been so prodigious for a year and a half, and are still so
      prodigious, that Livy was worrying altogether too much about them, and
      doing a very dangerous amount of lying awake on their account. It was
      necessary to stop that, and it is now stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she is remarkable, Joe. Her rheumatic attack set me to cursing and
      swearing, without limit as to time or energy, but it merely concentrated
      her patience and her unconquerable fortitude. It is the difference between
      us. I can&rsquo;t count the different kinds of ailments which have assaulted her
      in this fiendish year and a half&mdash;and I forgive none of them&mdash;but
      here she comes up again as bright and fresh and enterprising as ever, and
      goes to planning about Egypt, with a hope and a confidence which are to me
      amazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clara is calling for me&mdash;we have to go into town and pay calls.

     In Florence, that winter, Clemens began dictating to his secretary
     some autobiographical chapters.  This was the work which was &ldquo;not to
     see print until I am dead.&rdquo;  He found it a pleasant, lazy occupation
     and wrote his delight in it to Howells in a letter which seems not
     to have survived.  In his reply, Howells wrote: &ldquo;You do stir me
     mightily with the hope of dictating and I will try it when I get the
     chance.  But there is the tempermental difference.  You are dramatic
     and unconscious; you count the thing more than yourself; I am cursed
     with consciousness to the core, and can&rsquo;t say myself out; I am
     always saying myself in, and setting myself above all that I say, as
     of more worth.  Lately I have felt as if I were rotting with
     egotism.  I don&rsquo;t admire myself; I am sick of myself; but I can&rsquo;t
     think of anything else.  Here I am at it now, when I ought to be
     rejoicing with you at the blessing you have found....  I&rsquo;d like,
     immensely, to read your autobiography.  You always rather bewildered
     me by your veracity, and I fancy you may tell the truth about
     yourself.  But all of it?  The black truth which we all know of
     ourselves in our hearts, or only the whity-brown truth of the
     pericardium, or the nice, whitened truth of the shirtfront?  Even
     you won&rsquo;t tell the black heart&rsquo;s&mdash;truth.  The man who could do it
     would be famed to the last day the sun shone upon.&rdquo;
 
     We gather from Mark Twain&rsquo;s answer that he was not deceiving himself
     in the matter of his confessions.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                             VILLA DI QUARTO, FLORENCE,
                                                       March 14, &lsquo;04.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Yes, I set up the safeguards, in the first day&rsquo;s
      dictating; taking this position: that an autobiography is the truest of
      all books; for while it inevitably consists mainly of extinctions of the
      truth, shirkings of the truth, partial revealments of the truth, with
      hardly an instance of plain straight truth, the remorseless truth is
      there, between the lines, where the author is raking dust upon it, the
      result being that the reader knows the author in spite of his wily
      diligences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer in England! you can&rsquo;t ask better luck than that. Then you will
      run over to Florence; we shall all be hungry to see you-all. We are
      hunting for another villa, (this one is plenty large enough but has no
      room in it) but even if we find it I am afraid it will be months before we
      can move Mrs. Clemens. Of course it will. But it comforts us to let on
      that we think otherwise, and these pretensions help to keep hope alive in
      her.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    Good-bye, with love, Amen.

     News came of the death of Henry M.  Stanley, one of Mark Twain&rsquo;s
     oldest friends.  Clemens once said that he had met Stanley in St.
     Louis where he (Clemens) had delivered a lecture which Stanley had
     reported.  In the following letter he fixes the date of their
     meeting as early in 1867, which would be immediately after Mark
     Twain&rsquo;s return from California, and just prior to the Quaker City
     excursion&mdash;a fact which is interesting only because it places the
     two men together when each was at the very beginning of a great
     career.

    <p>
      DEAR LADY STANLEY,&mdash;I have lost a dear and honored friend&mdash;how
      fast they fall about me now, in my age! The world has lost a tried and
      proved hero. And you&mdash;what have you lost? It is beyond estimate&mdash;we
      who know you, and what he was to you, know that. How far he stretches
      across my life! I knew him when his work was all before him five years
      before the great day that he wrote his name far-away up on the blue of the
      sky for the world to see and applaud and remember; I have known him as
      friend and intimate ever since. It is 37 years. I have known no other
      friend and intimate so long, except John Hay&mdash;a friendship which
      dates from the same year and the same half of it, the first half of 1867.
      I grieve with you and with your family, dear Lady Stanley, it is all I can
      do; but that I do out of my heart. It would be we, instead of I, if Mrs.
      Clemens knew, but in all these 20 months that she has lain a prisoner in
      her bed we have hidden from her all things that could sadden her. Many a
      friend is gone whom she still asks about and still thinks is living.

      In deepest sympathy I beg the privilege of signing myself

    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;Yours has this moment arrived&mdash;just as I was
      finishing a note to poor Lady Stanley. I believe the last country-house
      visit we paid in England was to Stanley&rsquo;s. Lord, how my friends and
      acquaintances fall about me now, in my gray-headed days! Vereschagin,
      Mommsen, Dvorak, Lenbach, Jokai&mdash;all so recently, and now Stanley. I
      had known Stanley 37 years. Goodness, who is it I haven&rsquo;t known! As a rule
      the necrologies find me personally interested&mdash;when they treat of old
      stagers. Generally when a man dies who is worth cabling, it happens that I
      have run across him somewhere, some time or other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, say! Down by the Laurentian Library there&rsquo;s a marble image that has
      been sitting on its pedestal some 450 Years, if my dates are right&mdash;Cosimo
      I. I&rsquo;ve seen the back of it many a time, but not the front; but yesterday
      I twisted my head around after we had driven by, and the profane
      exclamation burst from my mouth before I could think: &ldquo;there&rsquo;s Chauncey
      Depew!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I mean to get a photo of it&mdash;and use it if it confirms yesterday&rsquo;s
      conviction. That&rsquo;s a very nice word from the Catholic Magazine and I am
      glad you sent it. I mean to show it to my priest&mdash;we are very fond of
      him. He is a stealing man, and is also learnedly scientific. He invented
      the thing which records the seismatic disturbances, for the peoples of the
      earth. And he&rsquo;s an astronomer and has an observatory of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, many&rsquo;s the cry I have, over reflecting that maybe we could have had
      Young Harmony for Livy, and didn&rsquo;t have wit enough to think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of Livy reminds me that your inquiry arrives at a good time
      (unberufen) It has been weeks (I don&rsquo;t know how many!) since we could have
      said a hopeful word, but this morning Katy came the minute the day-nurse
      came on watch and said words of a strange and long-forgotten sound: &ldquo;Mr.
      Clemens, Mrs. Clemens is really and truly better!&mdash;anybody can see
      it; she sees it herself; and last night at 9 o&rsquo;clock she said it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There&mdash;it is heart-warming, it is splendid, it is sublime; let us
      enjoy it, let us make the most of it today&mdash;and bet not a farthing on
      tomorrow. The tomorrows have nothing for us. Too many times they have
      breathed the word of promise to our ear and broken it to our hope. We take
      no tomorrow&rsquo;s word any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      You&rsquo;ve done a wonder, Joe: you&rsquo;ve written a letter that can be sent in to
      Livy&mdash;that doesn&rsquo;t often happen, when either a friend or a stranger
      writes. You did whirl in a P. S. that wouldn&rsquo;t do, but you wrote it on a
      margin of a page in such a way that I was able to clip off the margin
      clear across both pages, and now Livy won&rsquo;t perceive that the sheet isn&rsquo;t
      the same size it used to was. It was about Aldrich&rsquo;s son, and I came near
      forgetting to remove it. It should have been written on a loose strip and
      enclosed. That son died on the 5th of March and Aldrich wrote me on the
      night before that his minutes were numbered. On the 18th Livy asked after
      that patient, and I was prepared, and able to give her a grateful surprise
      by telling her &ldquo;the Aldriches are no longer uneasy about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I do wish I could have been present and heard Charley Clark. When he can&rsquo;t
      light up a dark place nobody can.

     Mrs. Clemens had her bad days and her good days-days when there
     seemed no ray of light, and others that seemed almost to promise

                                             May 12, &lsquo;04.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR GILDER,&mdash;A friend of ours (the Baroness de Nolda) was here this
      afternoon and wanted a note of introduction to the Century, for she has
      something to sell to you in case you&rsquo;ll want to make her an offer after
      seeing a sample of the goods. I said &ldquo;With pleasure: get the goods ready,
      send the same to me, I will have Jean type-write them, then I will mail
      them to the Century and tonight I will write the note to Mr. Gilder and
      start it along. Also write me a letter embodying what you have been saying
      to me about the goods and your proposed plan of arranging and explaining
      them, and I will forward that to Gilder too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As to the Baroness. She is a German; 30 years old; was married at 17; is
      very pretty-indeed I might say very pretty; has a lot of sons (5) running
      up from seven to 12 years old. Her husband is a Russian. They live half
      the time in Russia and the other half in Florence, and supply population
      alternately to the one country and then to the other. Of course it is a
      family that speaks languages. This occurs at their table&mdash;I know it
      by experience: It is Babel come again. The other day, when no guests were
      present to keep order, the tribes were all talking at once, and 6
      languages were being traded in; at last the littlest boy lost his temper
      and screamed out at the top of his voice, with angry sobs: &ldquo;Mais,
      vraiment, io non capisco gar nichts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Baroness is a little afraid of her English, therefore she will write
      her remarks in French&mdash;I said there&rsquo;s a plenty of translators in New
      York. Examine her samples and drop her a line.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two entire days, now, we have not been anxious about Mrs. Clemens
      (unberufen). After 20 months of bed-ridden solitude and bodily misery she
      all of a sudden ceases to be a pallid shrunken shadow, and looks bright
      and young and pretty. She remains what she always was, the most wonderful
      creature of fortitude, patience, endurance and recuperative power that
      ever was. But ah, dear, it won&rsquo;t last; this fiendish malady will play new
      treacheries upon her, and I shall go back to my prayers again&mdash;unutterable
      from any pulpit!

      May 13 10 A.M. I have just paid one of my pair of permitted 2 minutes

      waning hope.

     The year of the World&rsquo;s Fair had come, and an invitation from Gov.
     Francis, of Missouri, came to Mark Twain in Florence, personally
     inviting him to attend the great celebration and carry off first
     prize.  We may believe that Clemens felt little in the spirit of
     humor, but to such an invitation he must send a cheerful, even if
     disappointing, answer.

</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR GOVERNOR FRANCIS,&mdash;It has been a dear wish of mine to exhibit
      myself at the Great Fair and get a prize, but circumstances beyond my
      control have interfered, and I must remain in Florence. Although I have
      never taken prizes anywhere else I used to take them at school in Missouri
      half a century ago, and I ought to be able to repeat, now, if I could have
      a chance. I used to get the medal for good spelling, every week, and I
      could have had the medal for good conduct if there hadn&rsquo;t been so much
      corruption in Missouri in those days; still, I got it several times by
      trading medals and giving boot. I am willing to give boot now, if&mdash;however,
      those days are forever gone by in Missouri, and perhaps it is better so.
      Nothing ever stops the way it was in this changeable world. Although I
      cannot be at the Fair, I am going to be represented there anyway, by a

     It was only a few days after the foregoing was written that death
     entered Villa Quarto&mdash;unexpectedly at last&mdash;for with the first June
     days Mrs. Clemens had seemed really to improve.  It was on Sunday,
     June 5th, that the end came.  Clemens, with his daughter Jean, had
     returned from a long drive, during which they had visited a Villa
     with the thought of purchase.  On their return they were told that
     their patient had been better that afternoon than for three months.
     Yet it was only a few hours later that she left them, so suddenly
     and quietly that even those near her did not at first realize that
     she was gone.

    <p>
      DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Last night at 9.20 I entered Mrs. Clemens&rsquo;s room to
      say the usual goodnight&mdash;and she was dead&mdash;tho&rsquo; no one knew it.
      She had been cheerfully talking, a moment before. She was sitting up in
      bed&mdash;she had not lain down for months&mdash;and Katie and the nurse
      were supporting her. They supposed she had fainted, and they were holding
      the oxygen pipe to her mouth, expecting to revive her. I bent over her and
      looked in her face, and I think I spoke&mdash;I was surprised and troubled
      that she did not notice me. Then we understood, and our hearts broke. How
      poor we are today!
    </p>
    <p>
      But how thankful I am that her persecutions are ended. I would not call
      her back if I could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, treasured in her worn old Testament, I found a dear and gentle
      letter from you, dated Far Rockaway, Sept. 13, 1896, about our poor Susy&rsquo;s
      death. I am tired and old; I wish I were with Livy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I send my love-and hers-to you all.

     The family was now without plans for the future until they
     remembered the summer home of R. W. Gilder, at Tyringham,
     Massachusetts, and the possibility of finding lodgment for
     themselves in that secluded corner of New England.  Clemens wrote

    <p>
      DEAR GILDER FAMILY,&mdash;I have been worrying and worrying to know what
      to do: at last I went to the girls with an idea: to ask the Gilders to get
      us shelter near their summer home. It was the first time they have not
      shaken their heads. So to-morrow I will cable to you and shall hope to be
      in time.

    <p>
      An hour ago the best heart that ever beat for me and mine went silent out
      of this house, and I am as one who wanders and has lost his way. She who
      is gone was our head, she was our hands. We are now trying to make plans&mdash;we:
      we who have never made a plan before, nor ever needed to. If she could
      speak to us she would make it all simple and easy with a word, and our
      perplexities would vanish away. If she had known she was near to death she
      would have told us where to go and what to do: but she was not suspecting,
      neither were we. (She had been chatting cheerfully a moment before, and in
      an instant she was gone from us and we did not know it. We were not
      alarmed, we did not know anything had happened. It was a blessed death&mdash;she
      passed away without knowing it.) She was all our riches and she is gone:
      she was our breath, she was our life and now we are nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      We send you our love&mdash;and with it the love of you that was in her
      heart when she died.

      DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;We have to sit and hold our hands and wait&mdash;in
      the silence and solitude of this prodigious house; wait until June 25,
      then we go to Naples and sail in the Prince Oscar the 26th. There is a
      ship 12 days earlier (but we came in that one.) I see Clara twice a day&mdash;morning
      and evening&mdash;greeting&mdash;nothing more is allowed. She keeps her
      bed, and says nothing. She has not cried yet. I wish she could cry. It
      would break Livy&rsquo;s heart to see Clara. We excuse ourselves from all the
      friends that call&mdash;though of course only intimates come. Intimates&mdash;but
      they are not the old old friends, the friends of the old, old times when
      we laughed.

    <p>

      Soon your wife will be with you, oh fortunate man! And John, whom mine was

      DEAR JOE,&mdash;It is 13 days. I am bewildered and must remain so for a
      time longer. It was so sudden, so unexpected. Imagine a man worth a
      hundred millions who finds himself suddenly penniless and fifty million in
      debt in his old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was richer than any other person in the world, and now I am that pauper
      without peer. Some day I will tell you about it, not now.

     A tide of condolence flowed in from all parts of the world.  It was
     impossible to answer all.  Only a few who had been their closest
     friends received a written line, but the little printed
     acknowledgment which was returned was no mere formality.  It was a
     heartfelt, personal word.

     They arrived in America in July, and were accompanied by Twichell to
     Elmira, and on the 14th Mrs. Clemens was laid to rest by the side of
     Susy and little Langdon.  R. W. Gilder had arranged for them to
     occupy, for the summer, a cottage on his place at Tyringham, in the
     Berkshire Hills.  By November they were at the Grosvenor, in New
     York, preparing to establish themselves in a house which they had
     taken on the corner of Ninth Street and Fifth Avenue&mdash;Number 21.

    <p>
      DEAR DOUBLEDAY,&mdash;I did not know you were going to England: I would
      have freighted you with such messages of homage and affection to Kipling.
      And I would have pressed his hand, through you, for his sympathy with me
      in my crushing loss, as expressed by him in his letter to Gilder. You know
      my feeling for Kipling and that it antedates that expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was glad that the boys came here to invite me to the house-warming and I
      think they understood why a man in the shadow of a calamity like mine
      could not go.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has taken three months to repair and renovate our house&mdash;corner of
      9th and 5th Avenue, but I shall be in it in io or 15 days hence. Much of
      the furniture went into it today (from Hartford). We have not seen it for
      13 years. Katy Leary, our old housekeeper, who has been in our service
      more than 24 years, cried when she told me about it to-day. She said &ldquo;I
      had forgotten it was so beautiful, and it brought Mrs. Clemens right back
      to me&mdash;in that old time when she was so young and lovely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jean and my secretary and the servants whom we brought from Italy because
      Mrs. Clemens liked them so well, are still keeping house in the Berkshire
      hills&mdash;and waiting. Clara (nervously wrecked by her mother&rsquo;s death)
      is in the hands of a specialist in 69th St., and I shall not be allowed to
      have any communication with her&mdash;even telephone&mdash;for a year. I
      am in this comfortable little hotel, and still in bed&mdash;for I dasn&rsquo;t
      budge till I&rsquo;m safe from my pet devil, bronchitis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isn&rsquo;t it pathetic? One hour and ten minutes before Mrs. Clemens died I was
      saying to her &ldquo;To-day, after five months search, I&rsquo;ve found the villa that
      will content you: to-morrow you will examine the plans and give it your
      consent and I will buy it.&rdquo; Her eyes danced with pleasure, for she longed
      for a home of her own. And there, on that morrow, she lay white and cold.
      And unresponsive to my reverent caresses&mdash;a new thing to me and a new
      thing to her; that had not happened before in five and thirty years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am coming to see you and Mrs. Doubleday by and bye. She loved and
      honored Mrs. Doubleday and her work.

     It was a presidential year and the air was thick with politics.
     Mark Twain was no longer actively interested in the political
     situation; he was only disheartened by the hollowness and pretense
     of office-seeking, and the methods of office-seekers in general.
     Grieved that Twichell should still pin his faith to any party when
     all parties were so obviously venal and time-serving, he wrote in
     outspoken and rather somber protest.

    <p>
      Oh, dear! get out of that sewer&mdash;party politics&mdash;dear Joe. At
      least with your mouth. We hail only two men who could make speeches for
      their parties and preserve their honor and their dignity. One of them is
      dead. Possibly there were four. I am sorry for John Hay; sorry and
      ashamed. And yet I know he couldn&rsquo;t help it. He wears the collar, and he
      had to pay the penalty. Certainly he had no more desire to stand up before
      a mob of confiding human incapables and debauch them than you had.
      Certainly he took no more real pleasure in distorting history, concealing
      facts, propagating immoralities, and appealing to the sordid side of human
      nature than did you; but he was his party&rsquo;s property, and he had to climb
      away down and do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is interesting, wonderfully interesting&mdash;the miracles which
      party-politics can do with a man&rsquo;s mental and moral make-up. Look at
      McKinley, Roosevelt, and yourself: in private life spotless in character;
      honorable, honest, just, humane, generous; scorning trickeries,
      treacheries, suppressions of the truth, mistranslations of the meanings of
      facts, the filching of credit earned by another, the condoning of crime,
      the glorifying of base acts: in public political life the reverse of all
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      McKinley was a silverite&mdash;you concealed it. Roosevelt was a silverite&mdash;you
      concealed it. Parker was a silverite&mdash;you publish it. Along with a
      shudder and a warning: &ldquo;He was unsafe then. Is he any safer now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe, even I could be guilty of such a thing as that&mdash;if I were in
      party-politics; I really believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cleveland gave the country the gold standard; by implication you
      credit the matter to the Republican party.
    </p>
    <p>
      By implication you prove the whole annual pension-scoop, concealing the
      fact that the bulk of the money goes to people who in no way deserve it.
      You imply that all the batteners upon this bribery-fund are Republicans.
      An indiscreet confession, since about half of them must have been
      Democrats before they were bought.
    </p>
    <p>
      You as good as praise Order 78. It is true you do not shout, and you do
      not linger, you only whisper and skip&mdash;still, what little you do in
      the matter is complimentary to the crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      It means, if it means anything, that our outlying properties will all be
      given up by the Democrats, and our flag hauled down. All of them? Not only
      the properties stolen by Mr. McKinley and Mr. Roosevelt, but the
      properties honestly acquired? Joe, did you believe that hardy statement
      when you made it? Yet you made it, and there it stands in permanent print.
      Now what moral law would suffer if we should give up the stolen ones? But&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know our standard-bearer. He will maintain all that we have gained&rdquo;&mdash;by
      whatever process. Land, I believe you!
    </p>
    <p>
      By George, Joe, you are as handy at the game as if you had been in
      training for it all your life. Your campaign Address is built from the
      ground up upon the oldest and best models. There isn&rsquo;t a paragraph in it
      whose facts or morals will wash&mdash;not even a sentence, I believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you will soon be out of this. You didn&rsquo;t want to do it&mdash;that is
      sufficiently apparent, thanks be!&mdash;but you couldn&rsquo;t well get out of
      it. In a few days you will be out of it, and then you can fumigate
      yourself and take up your legitimate work again and resume your clean and
      wholesome private character once more and be happy&mdash;and useful.

      these reproaches, but on the whole I believe I won&rsquo;t.

      P. S.&mdash;Nov, 4. I wish I could learn to remember that it is unjust and
      dishonorable to put blame upon the human race for any of its acts. For it
      did not make itself, it did not make its nature, it is merely a machine,
      it is moved wholly by outside influences, it has no hand in creating the
      outside influences nor in choosing which of them it will welcome or
      reject, its performance is wholly automatic, it has no more mastership nor
      authority over its mind than it has over its stomach, which receives
      material from the outside and does as it pleases with it, indifferent to
      it&rsquo;s proprietor&rsquo;s suggestions, even, let alone his commands; wherefore,
      whatever the machine does&mdash;so called crimes and infamies included&mdash;is
      the personal act of its Maker, and He, solely, is responsible. I wish I
      could learn to pity the human race instead of censuring it and laughing at
      it; and I could, if the outside influences of old habit were not so strong
      upon my machine. It vexes me to catch myself praising the clean private
      citizen Roosevelt, and blaming the soiled President Roosevelt, when I know
      that neither praise nor blame is due to him for any thought or word or
      deed of his, he being merely a helpless and irresponsible coffee-mill
      ground by the hand of God.

     Through a misunderstanding, Clemens, something more than a year
     earlier, had severed his connection with the Players&rsquo; Club, of which
     he had been one of the charter members.  Now, upon his return to New
     York, a number of his friends joined in an invitation to him to
     return.  It was not exactly a letter they sent, but a bit of an old

      A year later, Mark Twain did &ldquo;come back again,&rdquo; as an honorary life
      member, and was given a dinner of welcome by those who had signed the
      lines urging his return.

      XLIV. LETTERS OF 1905. TO TWICHELL, MR. DUNEKA AND OTHERS. POLITICS AND
      HUMANITY. A SUMMER AT DUBLIN. MARK TWAIN AT 70.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     In 1884 Mark Twain had abandoned the Republican Party to vote for
     Cleveland.  He believed the party had become corrupt, and to his
     last day it was hard for him to see anything good in Republican
     policies or performance.  He was a personal friend of Theodore
     Roosevelt&rsquo;s but, as we have seen in a former letter, Roosevelt the
     politician rarely found favor in his eyes.  With or without
     justification, most of the President&rsquo;s political acts invited his
     caustic sarcasm and unsparing condemnation.  Another letter to
     Twichell of this time affords a fair example.

      To Rev. J. H. Twichell, in Hartford:

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                                       Feb. 16, &lsquo;05.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;I knew I had in me somewhere a definite feeling about the
      President if I could only find the words to define it with. Here they are,
      to a hair&mdash;from Leonard Jerome: &ldquo;For twenty years I have loved
      Roosevelt the man and hated Roosevelt the statesman and politician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s mighty good. Every time, in 25 years, that I have met Roosevelt the
      man, a wave of welcome has streaked through me with the hand-grip; but
      whenever (as a rule) I meet Roosevelt the statesman and politician, I find
      him destitute of morals and not respectworthy. It is plain that where his
      political self and his party self are concerned he has nothing resembling
      a conscience; that under those inspirations he is naively indifferent to
      the restraints of duty and even unaware of them; ready to kick the
      Constitution into the back yard whenever it gets in the way; and whenever
      he smells a vote, not only willing but eager to buy it, give extravagant
      rates for it and pay the bill not out of his own pocket or the party&rsquo;s,
      but out of the nation&rsquo;s, by cold pillage. As per Order 78 and the
      appropriation of the Indian trust funds.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Roosevelt is excusable&mdash;I recognize it and (ought to) concede it.
      We are all insane, each in his own way, and with insanity goes
      irresponsibility. Theodore the man is sane; in fairness we ought to keep
      in mind that Theodore, as statesman and politician, is insane and
      irresponsible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not throw these enlightenments aside, but study them, let them raise
      you to higher planes and make you better. You taught me in my callow days,
      let me pay back the debt now in my old age out of a thesaurus with wisdom
      smelted from the golden ores of experience.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         Ever yours for sweetness and light
                                                            MARK.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The next letter to Twichell takes up politics and humanity in
     general, in a manner complimentary to neither.  Mark Twain was never
     really a pessimist, but he had pessimistic intervals, such as come
     to most of us in life&rsquo;s later years, and at such times he let
     himself go without stint concerning &ldquo;the damned human race,&rdquo; as he
     called it, usually with a manifest sense of indignation that he
     should be a member of it.  In much of his later writing
     &mdash;A Mysterious Stranger for example&mdash;he said his say with but small
     restraint, and certainly in his purely intellectual moments he was
     likely to be a pessimist of the most extreme type, capably damning
     the race and the inventor of it.  Yet, at heart, no man loved his
     kind more genuinely, or with deeper compassion, than Mark Twain,
     perhaps for its very weaknesses.  It was only that he had intervals
     &mdash;frequent intervals, and rather long ones&mdash;when he did not admire
     it, and was still more doubtful as to the ways of providence.

                                                       March 14, &lsquo;05.
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;I have a Puddn&rsquo;head maxim:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When a man is a pessimist before 48 he knows too much; if he is an
      optimist after it, he knows too little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is with contentment, therefore, that I reflect that I am better and
      wiser than you. Joe, you seem to be dealing in &ldquo;bulks,&rdquo; now; the &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; of
      the farmers and U. S. Senators are &ldquo;honest.&rdquo; As regards purchase and sale
      with money? Who doubts it? Is that the only measure of honesty? Aren&rsquo;t
      there a dozen kinds of honesty which can&rsquo;t be measured by the
      money-standard? Treason is treason&mdash;and there&rsquo;s more than one form of
      it; the money-form is but one of them. When a person is disloyal to any
      confessed duty, he is plainly and simply dishonest, and knows it; knows
      it, and is privately troubled about it and not proud of himself. Judged by
      this standard&mdash;and who will challenge the validity of it?&mdash;there
      isn&rsquo;t an honest man in Connecticut, nor in the Senate, nor anywhere else.
      I do not even except myself, this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I finding fault with you and the rest of the populace? No&mdash;I
      assure you I am not. For I know the human race&rsquo;s limitations, and this
      makes it my duty&mdash;my pleasant duty&mdash;to be fair to it. Each
      person in it is honest in one or several ways, but no member of it is
      honest in all the ways required by&mdash;by what? By his own standard.
      Outside of that, as I look at it, there is no obligation upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Am I honest? I give you my word of honor (private) I am not. For seven
      years I have suppressed a book which my conscience tells me I ought to
      publish. I hold it a duty to publish it. There are other difficult duties
      which I am equal to, but I am not equal to that one. Yes, even I am
      dishonest. Not in many ways, but in some. Forty-one, I think it is. We are
      certainly all honest in one or several ways&mdash;every man in the world&mdash;though
      I have reason to think I am the only one whose black-list runs so light.
      Sometimes I feel lonely enough in this lofty solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, oh, yes, I am not overlooking the &ldquo;steady progress from age to age of
      the coming of the kingdom of God and righteousness.&rdquo; &ldquo;From age to age&rdquo;&mdash;yes,
      it describes that giddy gait. I (and the rocks) will not live to see it
      arrive, but that is all right&mdash;it will arrive, it surely will. But
      you ought not to be always ironically apologizing for the Deity. If that
      thing is going to arrive, it is inferable that He wants it to arrive; and
      so it is not quite kind of you, and it hurts me, to see you flinging
      sarcasms at the gait of it. And yet it would not be fair in me not to
      admit that the sarcasms are deserved. When the Deity wants a thing, and
      after working at it for &ldquo;ages and ages&rdquo; can&rsquo;t show even a shade of
      progress toward its accomplishment, we&mdash;well, we don&rsquo;t laugh, but it
      is only because we dasn&rsquo;t. The source of &ldquo;righteousness&rdquo;&mdash;is in the
      heart? Yes. And engineered and directed by the brain? Yes. Well, history
      and tradition testify that the heart is just about what it was in the
      beginning; it has undergone no shade of change. Its good and evil impulses
      and their consequences are the same today that they were in Old Bible
      times, in Egyptian times, in Greek times, in Middle Age times, in
      Twentieth Century times. There has been no change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the brain has undergone no change. It is what it always was.
      There are a few good brains and a multitude of poor ones. It was so in Old
      Bible times and in all other times&mdash;Greek, Roman, Middle Ages and
      Twentieth Century. Among the savages&mdash;all the savages&mdash;the
      average brain is as competent as the average brain here or elsewhere. I
      will prove it to you, some time, if you like. And there are great brains
      among them, too. I will prove that also, if you like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the 19th century made progress&mdash;the first progress after &ldquo;ages
      and ages&rdquo;&mdash;colossal progress. In what? Materialities. Prodigious
      acquisitions were made in things which add to the comfort of many and make
      life harder for as many more. But the addition to righteousness? Is that
      discoverable? I think not. The materialities were not invented in the
      interest of righteousness; that there is more righteousness in the world
      because of them than there, was before, is hardly demonstrable, I think.
      In Europe and America, there is a vast change (due to them) in ideals&mdash;do
      you admire it? All Europe and all America, are feverishly scrambling for
      money. Money is the supreme ideal&mdash;all others take tenth place with
      the great bulk of the nations named. Money-lust has always existed, but
      not in the history of the world was it ever a craze, a madness, until your
      time and mine. This lust has rotted these nations; it has made them hard,
      sordid, ungentle, dishonest, oppressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did England rise against the infamy of the Boer war? No&mdash;rose in
      favor of it. Did America rise against the infamy of the Phillipine war? No&mdash;rose
      in favor of it. Did Russia rise against the infamy of the present war? No&mdash;sat
      still and said nothing. Has the Kingdom of God advanced in Russia since
      the beginning of time?
    </p>
    <p>
      Or in Europe and America, considering the vast backward step of the
      money-lust? Or anywhere else? If there has been any progress toward
      righteousness since the early days of Creation&mdash;which, in my
      ineradicable honesty, I am obliged to doubt&mdash;I think we must confine
      it to ten per cent of the populations of Christendom, (but leaving,
      Russia, Spain and South America entirely out.) This gives us 320,000,000
      to draw the ten per cent from. That is to say, 32,000,000 have advanced
      toward righteousness and the Kingdom of God since the &ldquo;ages and ages&rdquo; have
      been flying along, the Deity sitting up there admiring. Well, you see it
      leaves 1,200,000,000 out of the race. They stand just where they have
      always stood; there has been no change.

      DEAR McKELWAY, Your innumerable friends are grateful, most grateful.

      As I understand the telegrams, the engineer of your train had never seen a
      locomotive before. Very well, then, I am once more glad that there is an
      Ever-watchful Providence to foresee possible results and send Ogdens and
      McIntyres along to save our friends.

    <p>
      The Government&rsquo;s Official report, showing that our railways killed twelve
      hundred persons last year and injured sixty thousand convinces me that
      under present conditions one Providence is not enough to properly and
      efficiently take care of our railroad business. But it is
      characteristically American&mdash;always trying to get along short-handed

     Clemens did not spend any more summers at Quarry Farm.  All its
     associations were beautiful and tender, but they could only sadden
     him.  The life there had been as of another world, sunlit, idyllic,
     now forever vanished.  For the summer of 1905 he leased the Copley
     Green house at Dublin, New Hampshire, where there was a Boston
     colony of writing and artistic folk, including many of his long-time
     friends.  Among them was Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who

</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR MR. FULTON,&mdash;I remember, as if it were yesterday, that when I
      disembarked from the overland stage in front of the Ormsby in Carson City
      in August, 1861, I was not expecting to be asked to come again. I was
      tired, discouraged, white with alkali dust, and did not know anybody; and
      if you had said then, &ldquo;Cheer up, desolate stranger, don&rsquo;t be down-hearted&mdash;pass
      on, and come again in 1905,&rdquo; you cannot think how grateful I would have
      been and how gladly I would have closed the contract. Although I was not
      expecting to be invited, I was watching out for it, and was hurt and
      disappointed when you started to ask me and changed it to, &ldquo;How soon are
      you going away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But you have made it all right, now, the wound is closed. And so I thank
      you sincerely for the invitation; and with you, all Reno, and if I were a
      few years younger I would accept it, and promptly. I would go. I would let
      somebody else do the oration, but, as for me, I would talk&mdash;just
      talk. I would renew my youth; and talk&mdash;and talk&mdash;and talk&mdash;and
      have the time of my life! I would march the unforgotten and unforgettable
      antiques by, and name their names, and give them reverent Hailand-farewell
      as they passed: Goodman, McCarthy, Gillis, Curry, Baldwin, Winters,
      Howard, Nye, Stewart; Neely Johnson, Hal Clayton, North, Root,&mdash;and
      my brother, upon whom be peace!&mdash;and then the desperadoes, who made
      life a joy and the &ldquo;Slaughter-house&rdquo; a precious possession: Sam Brown,
      Farmer Pete, Bill Mayfield, Six-fingered Jake, Jack Williams and the rest
      of the crimson discipleship&mdash;and so on and so on. Believe me, I would
      start a resurrection it would do you more good to look at than the next
      one will, if you go on the way you are doing now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were the days! those old ones. They will come no more. Youth will
      come no more. They were so full to the brim with the wine of life; there
      have been no others like them. It chokes me up to think of them. Would you
      like me to come out there and cry? It would not beseem my white head.

     Clemens found that the air of the New Hampshire hills agreed with
     him and stimulated him to work.  He began an entirely new version of
     The Mysterious Stranger, of which he already had a bulky and nearly
     finished manuscript, written in Vienna.  He wrote several hundred
     pages of an extravaganza entitled, Three Thousand Years Among the
     Microbes, and then, having got his superabundant vitality reduced
     (it was likely to expend itself in these weird mental exploits),
     he settled down one day and wrote that really tender and beautiful
     idyl, Eve&rsquo;s Diary, which he had begun, or at least planned, the
     previous summer at Tyringham.  In a letter to Mr. Frederick A.
     Duneka, general manager of Harper &amp; Brothers, he tells something of
     the manner of the story; also his revised opinion of Adam&rsquo;s Diary,
     written in &lsquo;93, and originally published as a souvenir of Niagara
     Falls.

</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR MR. DUNEKA,&mdash;I wrote Eve&rsquo;s Diary, she using Adam&rsquo;s Diary as her
      (unwitting and unconscious) text, of course, since to use any other text
      would have been an imbecility&mdash;then I took Adam&rsquo;s Diary and read it.
      It turned my stomach. It was not literature; yet it had been literature
      once&mdash;before I sold it to be degraded to an advertisement of the
      Buffalo Fair. I was going to write and ask you to melt the plates and put
      it out of print.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this morning I examined it without temper, and saw that if I abolished
      the advertisement it would be literature again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I have done it. I have struck out 700 words and inserted 5 MS pages of
      new matter (650 words), and now Adam&rsquo;s Diary is dam good&mdash;sixty times
      as good as it ever was before.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe it is as good as Eve&rsquo;s Diary now&mdash;no, it&rsquo;s not quite that
      good, I guess, but it is good enough to go in the same cover with Eve&rsquo;s.
      I&rsquo;m sure of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hate to have the old Adam go out any more&mdash;don&rsquo;t put it on the
      presses again, let&rsquo;s put the new one in place of it; and next Xmas, let us
      bind Adam and Eve in one cover. They score points against each other&mdash;so,
      if not bound together, some of the points would not be perceived.....
    </p>
    <p>
      P. S. Please send another Adam&rsquo;s Diary, so that I can make 2 revised
      copies. Eve&rsquo;s Diary is Eve&rsquo;s love-Story, but we will not name it that.

     The peace-making at Portsmouth between Japan and Russia was not
     satisfactory to Mark Twain, who had fondly hoped there would be no
     peace until, as he said, &ldquo;Russian liberty was safe.  One more battle
     would have abolished the waiting chains of millions upon millions of
     unborn Russians and I wish it could have been fought.&rdquo;  He set down
     an expression of his feelings for the Associated Press, and it
     invited many letters.  Charles Francis Adams wrote, &ldquo;It attracted my
     attention because it so exactly expresses the views I have myself
     all along entertained.&rdquo;
 
     Clemens was invited by Colonel George Harvey to dine with the
     Russian emissaries, Baron Rosen and Sergius Witte.  He declined, but
     his telegram so pleased Witte that he asked permission to publish
     it, and announced that he would show it to the Czar.

      Susy dear, I have had a lovely dream. Livy, dressed in black, was sitting
      up in my bed (here) at my right and looking as young and sweet as she used
      to do when she was in health. She said: &ldquo;what is the name of your sweet
      sister?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Pamela.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes, that is it, I thought it was&mdash;&rdquo;
       (naming a name which has escaped me) &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you write it down for me?&rdquo; I
      reached eagerly for a pen and pad&mdash;laid my hands upon both&mdash;then
      said to myself, &ldquo;It is only a dream,&rdquo; and turned back sorrowfully and
      there she was, still. The conviction flamed through me that our lamented
      disaster was a dream, and this a reality. I said, &ldquo;How blessed it is, how
      blessed it is, it was all a dream, only a dream!&rdquo; She only smiled and did
      not ask what dream I meant, which surprised me. She leaned her head
      against mine and I kept saying, &ldquo;I was perfectly sure it was a dream, I
      never would have believed it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I think she said several things, but if so they are gone from my memory. I
      woke and did not know I had been dreaming. She was gone. I wondered how
      she could go without my knowing it, but I did not spend any thought upon
      that, I was too busy thinking of how vivid and real was the dream that we
      had lost her and how unspeakably blessed it was to find that it was not
      true and that she was still ours and with us.

      DEAR MR. DUNEKA,&mdash;I have just finished a short story which I &ldquo;greatly

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        Oct.  7, 1906. [&rsquo;05]
</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR MR. DUNEKA,&mdash;... I&rsquo;ve made a poor guess as to number of words. I
      think there must be 20,000. My usual page of MS. contains about 130 words;
      but when I am deeply interested in my work and dead to everything else, my
      hand-writing shrinks and shrinks until there&rsquo;s a great deal more than 130
      on a page&mdash;oh, yes, a deal more. Well, I discover, this morning, that
      this tale is written in that small hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      This strong interest is natural, for the heroine is my daughter, Susy,
      whom we lost. It was not intentional&mdash;it was a good while before I
      found it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I am sending you her picture to use&mdash;and to reproduce with
      photographic exactness the unsurpassable expression and all. May you find
      an artist who has lost an idol!
    </p>
    <p>
      Take as good care of the picture as you can and restore it to me when I
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you will illustrate this tale considerably. Not humorous pictures.
      No. When they are good (or bad) one&rsquo;s humor gets no chance to play
      surprises on the reader. A humorous subject illustrated seriously is all
      right, but a humorous artist is no fit person for such work. You see, the
      humorous writer pretends to absolute seriousness (when he knows his trade)
      then for an artist&mdash;to step in and give his calculated gravity all
      away with a funny picture&mdash;oh, my land! It gives me the dry gripes
      just to think of it. It would be just about up to the average comic
      artist&rsquo;s intellectual level to make a funny picture of the horse kicking
      the lungs out of a trader. Hang it, the remark is funny&mdash;because the
      horse is not aware of it but the fact is not humorous, it is tragic and it
      is no subject for a humorous picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could I be allowed to sit in judgment upon the pictures before they are
      accepted&mdash;at least those in which Cathy may figure?
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not essential. It is but a suggestion, and it is hereby withdrawn,
      if it would be troublesome or cause delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you will reproduce the cat-pile, full page. And save the photo for
      me in as good condition as possible. When Susy and Clara were little tots
      those cats had their profoundest worship, and there is no duplicate of
      this picture. These cats all had thundering names, or inappropriate ones&mdash;furnished
      by the children with my help. One was named Buffalo Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you interested in coincidences?
    </p>
    <p>
      After discovering, about the middle of the book, that Cathy was Susy
      Clemens, I put her picture with my MS., to be reproduced. After the book
      was finished it was discovered that Susy had a dim model of Soldier Boy in
      her arms; I had forgotten all about that toy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I examined the cat-picture and laid it with the MS. for introduction;
      but it was not until yesterday that I remembered that one of the cats was
      named Buffalo Bill.
    </p>

     The reference in this letter to shrinkage of his hand-writing with
     the increasing intensity of his interest, and the consequent
     addition of the number of words to the page, recalls another fact,
     noted by Mr. Duneka, viz.: that because of his terse Anglo-Saxon
     diction, Mark Twain could put more words on a magazine page than any
     other writer.  It is hardly necessary to add that he got more force
     into what he put on the page for the same reason.

     There was always a run of reporters at Mark Twain&rsquo;s New York home.
     His opinion was sought for on every matter of public interest, and
     whatever happened to him in particular was considered good for at
     least half a column of copy, with his name as a catch-line at the
     top.  When it was learned that he was to spend the summer in New
     Hampshire, the reporters had all wanted to find out about it.  Now
     that the summer was ending, they began to want to know how he had
     liked it, what work he had done and what were his plans for another
     year.  As they frequently applied to his publishers for these
     details it was finally suggested to him that he write a letter
     furnishing the required information.  His reply, handed to Mr.
     Duneka, who was visiting him at the moment, is full of interest.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                          Mem.  for Mr. Duneka:

                                                  DUBLIN, Oct. 9, 1905.
</pre>
    <p>
      ... As to the other matters, here are the details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I have tried a number of summer homes, here and in Europe together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these homes had charms of its own; charms and delights of its own,
      and some of them&mdash;even in Europe had comforts. Several of them had
      conveniences, too. They all had a &ldquo;view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is my conviction that there should always be some water in a view&mdash;a
      lake or a river, but not the ocean, if you are down on its level. I think
      that when you are down on its level it seldom inflames you with an ecstasy
      which you could not get out of a sand-flat. It is like being on board
      ship, over again; indeed it is worse than that, for there&rsquo;s three months
      of it. On board ship one tires of the aspects in a couple of days, and
      quits looking. The same vast circle of heaving humps is spread around you
      all the time, with you in the centre of it and never gaining an inch on
      the horizon, so far as you can see; for variety, a flight of flying-fish,
      mornings; a flock of porpoises throwing summersaults afternoons; a remote
      whale spouting, Sundays; occasional phosphorescent effects, nights; every
      other day a streak of black smoke trailing along under the horizon; on the
      one single red letter day, the illustrious iceberg. I have seen that
      iceberg thirty-four times in thirty-seven voyages; it is always the same
      shape, it is always the same size, it always throws up the same old flash
      when the sun strikes it; you may set it on any New York door-step of a
      June morning and light it up with a mirror-flash; and I will engage to
      recognize it. It is artificial, and it is provided and anchored out by the
      steamer companies. I used to like the sea, but I was young then, and could
      easily get excited over any kind of monotony, and keep it up till the
      monotonies ran out, if it was a fortnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last January, when we were beginning to inquire about a home for this
      summer, I remembered that Abbott Thayer had said, three years before, that
      the New Hampshire highlands was a good place. He was right&mdash;it was a
      good place. Any place that is good for an artist in paint is good for an
      artist in morals and ink. Brush is here, too; so is Col. T. W. Higginson;
      so is Raphael Pumpelly; so is Mr. Secretary Hitchcock; so is Henderson; so
      is Learned; so is Summer; so is Franklin MacVeigh; so is Joseph L. Smith;
      so is Henry Copley Greene, when I am not occupying his house, which I am
      doing this season. Paint, literature, science, statesmanship, history,
      professorship, law, morals,&mdash;these are all represented here, yet
      crime is substantially unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer homes of these refugees are sprinkled, a mile apart, among the
      forest-clad hills, with access to each other by firm smooth country roads
      which are so embowered in dense foliage that it is always twilight in
      there, and comfortable. The forests are spider-webbed with these good
      roads, they go everywhere; but for the help of the guide-boards, the
      stranger would not arrive anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village&mdash;Dublin&mdash;is bunched together in its own place, but a
      good telephone service makes its markets handy to all those outliars. I
      have spelt it that way to be witty. The village executes orders on, the
      Boston plan&mdash;promptness and courtesy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer homes are high-perched, as a rule, and have contenting
      outlooks. The house we occupy has one. Monadnock, a soaring double hump,
      rises into the sky at its left elbow&mdash;that is to say, it is close at
      hand. From the base of the long slant of the mountain the valley spreads
      away to the circling frame of the hills, and beyond the frame the billowy
      sweep of remote great ranges rises to view and flows, fold upon fold, wave
      upon wave, soft and blue and unwordly, to the horizon fifty miles away. In
      these October days Monadnock and the valley and its framing hills make an
      inspiring picture to look at, for they are sumptuously splashed and
      mottled and be-torched from sky-line to sky-line with the richest dyes the
      autumn can furnish; and when they lie flaming in the full drench of the
      mid-afternoon sun, the sight affects the spectator physically, it stirs
      his blood like military music.
    </p>
    <p>
      These summer homes are commodious, well built, and well furnished&mdash;facts
      which sufficiently indicate that the owners built them to live in
      themselves. They have furnaces and wood fireplaces, and the rest of the
      comforts and conveniences of a city home, and can be comfortably occupied
      all the year round.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot have this house next season, but I have secured Mrs. Upton&rsquo;s
      house which is over in the law and science quarter, two or three miles
      from here, and about the same distance from the art, literary, and
      scholastic groups. The science and law quarter has needed improving, this
      good while.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearest railway-station is distant something like an hour&rsquo;s drive; it
      is three hours from there to Boston, over a branch line. You can go to New
      York in six hours per branch lines if you change cars every time you think
      of it, but it is better to go to Boston and stop over and take the trunk
      line next day, then you do not get lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is claimed that the atmosphere of the New Hampshire highlands is
      exceptionally bracing and stimulating, and a fine aid to hard and
      continuous work. It is a just claim, I think. I came in May, and wrought
      35 successive days without a break. It is possible that I could not have
      done it elsewhere. I do not know; I have not had any disposition to try
      it, before. I think I got the disposition out of the atmosphere, this
      time. I feel quite sure, in fact, that that is where it came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am ashamed to confess what an intolerable pile of manuscript I ground
      out in the 35 days, therefore I will keep the number of words to myself. I
      wrote the first half of a long tale&mdash;&ldquo;The Adventures of a Microbe&rdquo;
       and put it away for a finish next summer, and started another long tale&mdash;&ldquo;The
      Mysterious Stranger;&rdquo; I wrote the first half of it and put it with the
      other for a finish next summer. I stopped, then. I was not tired, but I
      had no books on hand that needed finishing this year except one that was
      seven years old. After a little I took that one up and finished it. Not
      for publication, but to have it ready for revision next summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I stopped work I have had a two months&rsquo; holiday. The summer has been
      my working time for 35 years; to have a holiday in it (in America) is new
      for me. I have not broken it, except to write &ldquo;Eve&rsquo;s Diary&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Horse&rsquo;s
      Tale&rdquo;&mdash;short things occupying the mill 12 days.
    </p>
    <p>
      This year our summer is 6 months long and ends with November and the
      flight home to New York, but next year we hope and expect to stretch it
      another month and end it the first of December.

     The fact that he was a persistent smoker was widely known, and many
     friends and admirers of Mark Twain sent him cigars, most of which he
     could not use, because they were too good.  He did not care for
     Havana cigars, but smoked the fragrant, inexpensive domestic tobacco
     with plenty of &ldquo;pep&rdquo; in it, as we say today.  Now and then he had an
     opportunity to head off some liberal friend, who wrote asking
     permission to contribute to his cigar collection, as instance the
     following.

      DEAR MR. POWERS,&mdash;I should accept your hospitable offer at once but
      for the fact I couldn&rsquo;t do it and remain honest. That is to say if I
      allowed you to send me what you believe to be good cigars it would
      distinctly mean that I meant to smoke them, whereas I should do nothing of
      the kind. I know a good cigar better than you do, for I have had 60 years
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, that is not what I mean; I mean I know a bad cigar better than anybody
      else; I judge by the price only; if it costs above 5 cents I know it to be
      either foreign or half-foreign, and unsmokeable. By me I have many boxes
      of Havana cigars, of all prices from 20 cts apiece up to 1.66 apiece; I
      bought none of them, they were all presents, they are an accumulation of
      several years. I have never smoked one of them and never shall, I work
      them off on the visitor. You shall have a chance when you come.

     In spite of all the fine photographs that were made of him, there
     recurred constantly among those sent him to be autographed a print
     of one which, years before, Sarony had made and placed on public
     sale.  It was a good photograph, mechanically and even artistically,
     but it did not please Mark Twain.  Whenever he saw it he recalled
     Sarony with bitterness and severity.  Once he received an inquiry
     concerning it, and thus feelingly expressed himself.

    <p>
      DEAR MR. ROW,&mdash;That alleged portrait has a private history. Sarony
      was as much of an enthusiast about wild animals as he was about
      photography; and when Du Chaillu brought the first Gorilla to this country
      in 1819 he came to me in a fever of excitement and asked me if my father
      was of record and authentic. I said he was; then Sarony, without any
      abatement of his excitement asked if my grandfather also was of record and
      authentic. I said he was. Then Sarony, with still rising excitement and
      with joy added to it, said he had found my great grandfather in the person
      of the gorilla, and had recognized him at once by his resemblance to me. I
      was deeply hurt but did not reveal this, because I knew Saxony meant no
      offense for the gorilla had not done him any harm, and he was not a man
      who would say an unkind thing about a gorilla wantonly. I went with him to
      inspect the ancestor, and examined him from several points of view,
      without being able to detect anything more than a passing resemblance.
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Sarony with confidence, &ldquo;let me show you.&rdquo; He borrowed my
      overcoat&mdash;and put it on the gorilla. The result was surprising. I saw
      that the gorilla while not looking distinctly like me was exactly what my
      great grand father would have looked like if I had had one. Sarong
      photographed the creature in that overcoat, and spread the picture about
      the world. It has remained spread about the world ever since. It turns up
      every week in some newspaper somewhere or other. It is not my favorite,
      but to my exasperation it is everybody else&rsquo;s. Do you think you could get
      it suppressed for me? I will pay the limit.

     The year 1905 closed triumphantly for Mark Twain.  The great
     &ldquo;Seventieth Birthday&rdquo; dinner planned by Colonel George Harvey is
     remembered to-day as the most notable festival occasion in New York

     MARK TWAIN at &ldquo;Pier Seventy,&rdquo; as he called it, paused to look
     backward and to record some memoirs of his long, eventful past.  The
     Autobiography dictations begun in Florence were resumed, and daily
     he traveled back, recalling long-ago scenes and all-but-forgotten
     places.  He was not without reminders.  Now and again there came
     some message that brought back the old days&mdash;the Tom Sawyer and Huck
     Finn days&mdash;or the romance of the river that he never recalled other
     than with tenderness and a tone of regret that it was gone.  An
     invitation to the golden wedding of two ancient friends moved and
     saddened him, and his answer to it conveys about all the story of
     life.

      am trying to adjust my focus to it and realize how much it means. It is
      inconceivable! With a simple sweep it carries me back over a stretch of

      brings before me Mrs. Gordon, young, round-limbed, handsome; and with her

     Though he used very little liquor of any kind, it was Mark Twain&rsquo;s
     custom to keep a bottle of Scotch whiskey with his collection of
     pipes and cigars and tobacco on a little table by his bed-side.
     During restless nights he found a small quantity of it conducive to
     sleep.  Andrew Carnegie, learning of this custom, made it his
     business to supply Scotch of his own special importation.  The first
     case came, direct from Scotland.  When it arrived Clemens sent this
     characteristic acknowledgment.

     The series of letters which follows was prepared by Mark Twain and
     General Fred Grant, mainly with a view of advertising the lecture
     that Clemens had agreed to deliver for the benefit of the Robert
     Fulton Monument Association.  It was, in fact, to be Mark Twain&rsquo;s
     &ldquo;farewell lecture,&rdquo; and the association had really proposed to pay
     him a thousand dollars for it.  The exchange of these letters,
     however, was never made outside of Mark Twain&rsquo;s bed-room.  Propped
     against the pillows, pen in hand, with General Grant beside him,
     they arranged the series with the idea of publication.  Later the
     plan was discarded, so that this pleasant foolery appears here for

      DEAR GENERAL,&mdash;I mean the pay-platform; I shan&rsquo;t retire from the
      gratis-platform until after I am dead and courtesy requires me to keep
      still and not disturb the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      What shall I talk about? My idea is this: to instruct the audience about
      Robert Fulton, and.... Tell me&mdash;was that his real name, or was it his
      nom de plume? However, never mind, it is not important&mdash;I can skip
      it, and the house will think I knew all about it, but forgot. Could you
      find out for me if he was one of the Signers of the Declaration, and which
      one? But if it is any trouble, let it alone, I can skip it. Was he out
      with Paul Jones? Will you ask Horace Porter? And ask him if he brought
      both of them home. These will be very interesting facts, if they can be
      established. But never mind, don&rsquo;t trouble Porter, I can establish them
      anyway. The way I look at it, they are historical gems&mdash;gems of the
      very first water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that is my idea, as I have said: first, excite the audience with a
      spoonful of information about Fulton, then quiet down with a barrel of
      illustration drawn by memory from my books&mdash;and if you don&rsquo;t say
      anything the house will think they never heard of it before, because
      people don&rsquo;t really read your books, they only say they do, to keep you
      from feeling bad. Next, excite the house with another spoonful of
      Fultonian fact, then tranquilize them again with another barrel of
      illustration. And so on and so on, all through the evening; and if you are
      discreet and don&rsquo;t tell them the illustrations don&rsquo;t illustrate anything,
      they won&rsquo;t notice it and I will send them home as well-informed about
      Robert Fulton as I am myself. Don&rsquo;t be afraid; I know all about audiences,
      they believe everything you say, except when you are telling the truth.

     The seat chosen for the writer of these notes was to be at the front
     of the stage in order that the lecturer might lean over now and then
     and pretend to be asking information concerning Fulton.  I was not
     entirely happy in the thought of this showy honor, and breathed more
     freely when this plan was abandoned and the part assigned to General
     Grant.

     The lecture was given in Carnegie Hall, which had been gayly
     decorated for the occasion.  The house was more than filled, and a
     great sum of money was realized for the fund.

     It was that spring that Gorky and Tchaikowski, the Russian
     revolutionists, came to America hoping to arouse interest in their
     cause.  The idea of the overthrow of the Russian dynasty was
     pleasant to Mark Twain.  Few things would have given him greater
     comfort than to have known that a little more than ten years would
     see the downfall of Russian imperialism.  The letter which follows
     was a reply to an invitation from Tchaikowski, urging him to speak
     at one of the meetings.

      DEAR MR. TCHAIKOWSKI,&mdash;I thank you for the honor of the invitation,
      but I am not able to accept it, because on Thursday evening I shall be
      presiding at a meeting whose object is to find remunerative work for
      certain classes of our blind who would gladly support themselves if they
      had the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      My sympathies are with the Russian revolution, of course. It goes without
      saying. I hope it will succeed, and now that I have talked with you I take
      heart to believe it will. Government by falsified promises; by lies, by
      treacheries, and by the butcher-knife for the aggrandizement of a single
      family of drones and its idle and vicious kin has been borne quite long
      enough in Russia, I should think, and it is to be hoped that the roused
      nation, now rising in its strength, will presently put an end to it and
      set up the republic in its place. Some of us, even of the white headed,
      may live to see the blessed day when Czars and Grand Dukes will be as
      scarce there as I trust they are in heaven.

     There came another summer at Dublin, New Hampshire, this time in the
     fine Upton residence on the other slope of Monadnock, a place of
     equally beautiful surroundings, and an even more extended view.
     Clemens was at this time working steadily on his so-called
     Autobiography, which was not that, in fact, but a series of
     remarkable chapters, reminiscent, reflective, commentative, written
     without any particular sequence as to time or subject-matter.  He
     dictated these chapters to a stenographer, usually in the open air,
     sitting in a comfortable rocker or pacing up and down the long
     veranda that faced a vast expanse of wooded slope and lake and
     distant blue mountains.  It became one of the happiest occupations
     of his later years.

    <p>
      DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;..... The dictating goes lazily and pleasantly on.
      With intervals. I find that I have been at it, off and on, nearly two
      hours a day for 155 days, since Jan. 9. To be exact I&rsquo;ve dictated 75 hours
      in 80 days and loafed 75 days. I&rsquo;ve added 60,000 words in the month that
      I&rsquo;ve been here; which indicates that I&rsquo;ve dictated during 20 days of that
      time&mdash;40 hours, at an average of 1,500 words an hour. It&rsquo;s a plenty,
      and I am satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      There&rsquo;s a good deal of &ldquo;fat&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve dictated, (from Jan. 9) 210,000 words,
      and the &ldquo;fat&rdquo; adds about 50,000 more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;fat&rdquo; is old pigeon-holed things, of the years gone by, which I or
      editors didn&rsquo;t das&rsquo;t to print. For instance, I am dumping in the little
      old book which I read to you in Hartford about 30 years ago and which you
      said &ldquo;publish&mdash;and ask Dean Stanley to furnish an introduction; he&rsquo;ll
      do it.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Captain Stormfield&rsquo;s Visit to Heaven.&rdquo;) It reads quite to suit
      me, without altering a word, now that it isn&rsquo;t to see print until I am
      dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow I mean to dictate a chapter which will get my heirs and assigns
      burnt alive if they venture to print it this side of 2006 A.D.&mdash;which
      I judge they won&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;ll be lots of such chapters if I live 3 or 4
      years longer. The edition of A.D. 2006 will make a stir when it comes out.
      I shall be hovering around taking notice, along with other dead pals. You
      are invited.

     His tendency to estimate the measure of the work he was doing, and
     had completed, must have clung to him from his old printer days.

     The chapter which was to get his heirs and assigns burned alive was
     on the orthodox God, and there was more than one such chapter.  In
     the next letter he refers to two exquisite poems by Howells, and the
     writer of these notes recalls his wonderful reading of them aloud.
     &lsquo;In Our Town&rsquo; was a collection of short stories then recently issued
     by William Allen White.  Howells had recommended them.

      DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;It is lovely of you to say those beautiful things&mdash;I

      I read &ldquo;After the Wedding&rdquo; aloud and we felt all the pain of it and the
      truth. It was very moving and very beautiful&mdash;would have been
      over-comingly moving, at times, but for the haltings and pauses compelled
      by the difficulties of MS&mdash;these were a protection, in that they
      furnished me time to brace up my voice, and get a new start. Jean wanted
      to keep the MS for another reading-aloud, and for &ldquo;keeps,&rdquo; too, I
      suspected, but I said it would be safest to write you about it.

      After &ldquo;After the Wedding&rdquo; I read &ldquo;The Mother&rdquo; aloud and sounded its human

      first published.

      I have been dictating some fearful things, for 4 successive mornings&mdash;for
      no eye but yours to see until I have been dead a century&mdash;if then.

      DEAR MR. WHITE,&mdash;Howells told me that &ldquo;In Our Town&rdquo; was a charming
      book, and indeed it is. All of it is delightful when read one&rsquo;s self,
      parts of it can score finely when subjected to the most exacting of tests&mdash;the
      reading aloud. Pages 197 and 216 are of that grade. I have tried them a
      couple of times on the family, and pages 212 and 216 are qualified to

     Witter Bynner, the poet, was one of the editors of McClure&rsquo;s
     Magazine at this time, but was trying to muster the courage to give
     up routine work for verse-making and the possibility of poverty.
     Clemens was fond of Bynner and believed in his work.  He did not
     advise him, however, to break away entirely from a salaried
     position&mdash;at least not immediately; but one day Bynner did so, and
     reported the step he had taken, with some doubt as to the answer he
     would receive.

      DEAR POET,&mdash;You have certainly done right for several good reasons;
      at least, of them, I can name two:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. With your reputation you can have your freedom and yet earn your
      living. 2. if you fall short of succeeding to your wish, your reputation
      will provide you another job. And so in high approval I suppress the
      scolding and give you the saintly and fatherly pat instead.

     On another occasion, when Bynner had written a poem to Clara
     Clemens, her father pretended great indignation that the first poem
     written by Bynner to any one in his household should not be to him,
     and threatened revenge.  At dinner shortly after he produced from
     his pocket a slip of paper on which he had set down what he said was
     &ldquo;his only poem.&rdquo;  He read the lines that follow:

               &ldquo;Of all sad words of tongue or pen,
               The saddest are these: It might have been.
               Ah, say not so! as life grows longer, leaner, thinner,
               We recognize, O God, it might have Bynner!&rdquo;
 
     He returned to New York in October and soon after was presented by
     Mrs. H. H. Rogers with a handsome billiard-table.

     He had a passion for the game, but had played comparatively little
     since the old Hartford days of fifteen years before, when a group of
     his friends used to assemble on Friday nights in the room at the top
     of the house for long, strenuous games and much hilarity.  Now the
     old fever all came back; the fascinations of the game superseded
     even his interest in the daily dictations.

      DEAR MRS. ROGERS,&mdash;The billiard table is better than the doctors. It
      is driving out the heartburn in a most promising way. I have a billiardist
      on the premises, and I walk not less than ten miles every day with the cue
      in my hand. And the walking is not the whole of the exercise, nor the most
      health-giving part of it, I think. Through the multitude of the positions
      and attitudes it brings into play every muscle in the body and exercises
      them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The games begin right after luncheon, daily, and continue until midnight,
      with 2 hours&rsquo; intermission for dinner and music. And so it is 9 hours&rsquo; 
      exercise per day, and 10 or 12 on Sunday. Yesterday and last night it was
      12&mdash;and I slept until 8 this morning without waking. The billiard
      table, as a Sabbath breaker can beat any coal-breaker in Pennsylvania, and
      give it 30 in, the game. If Mr. Rogers will take to daily billiards he can
      do without doctors and the massageur, I think.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are really going to build a house on my farm, an hour and a half from
      New York. It is decided. It is to be built by contract, and is to come
      within $25,000.

      and most satisfactory characters I have ever met. Others knew it before,
      but I have always been busy with other matters.

     The &ldquo;billiardist on the premises&rdquo; was the writer of these notes,
     who, earlier in the year, had become his biographer, and, in the

     was one which he had bought at Redding, Connecticut, where, later,
     he built the house known as &ldquo;Stormfield.&rdquo;
 
     Henry Mills Alden, for nearly forty years editor of Harper&rsquo;s
     Magazine, arrived at his seventieth birthday on November 11th that
     year, and Harper &amp; Brothers had arranged to give him a great dinner
     in the offices of Franklin Square, where, for half a century, he had
     been an active force.  Mark Twain, threatened with a cold, and
     knowing the dinner would be strenuous, did not feel able to attend,
     so wrote a letter which, if found suitable, could be read at the
     gathering.

    <p>
      ALDEN,&mdash;dear and ancient friend&mdash;it is a solemn moment. You have
      now reached the age of discretion. You have been a long time arriving.
      Many years ago you docked me on an article because the subject was too
      old; later, you docked me on an article because the subject was too new;
      later still, you docked me on an article because the subject was betwixt
      and between. Once, when I wrote a Letter to Queen Victoria, you did not
      put it in the respectable part of the Magazine, but interred it in that
      potter&rsquo;s field, the Editor&rsquo;s Drawer. As a result, she never answered it.
      How often we recall, with regret, that Napoleon once shot at a magazine
      editor and missed him and killed a publisher. But we remember, with
      charity, that his intentions were good.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will reform, now, Alden. You will cease from these economies, and you
      will be discharged. But in your retirement you will carry with you the
      admiration and earnest good wishes of the oppressed and toiling scribes.
      This will be better than bread. Let this console you when the bread fails.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will carry with you another thing, too&mdash;the affection of the
      scribes; for they all love you in spite of your crimes. For you bear a
      kind heart in your breast, and the sweet and winning spirit that charms
      away all hostilities and animosities, and makes of your enemy your friend
      and keeps him so. You have reigned over us thirty-six years, and, please

     A copyright bill was coming up in Washington and a delegation of
     authors went down to work for it.  Clemens was not the head of the
     delegation, but he was the most prominent member of it, as well as
     the most useful.  He invited the writer to accompany him, and
     elsewhere I have told in detail the story of that excursion,&mdash;[See
     Mark Twain; A Biography, chap.  ccli,]&mdash;which need be but briefly
     touched upon here.

     His work was mainly done aside from that of the delegation.  They
     had him scheduled for a speech, however, which he made without notes
     and with scarcely any preparation.  Meantime he had applied to
     Speaker Cannon for permission to allow him on the floor of the
     House, where he could buttonhole the Congressmen.  He was not
     eligible to the floor without having received the thanks of
     Congress, hence the following letter:

      DEAR UNCLE JOSEPH,&mdash;Please get me the thanks of the Congress&mdash;not
      next week but right away. It is very necessary. Do accomplish this for
      your affectionate old friend right away; by persuasion, if you can, by
      violence if you must, for it is imperatively necessary that I get on the
      floor for two or three hours and talk to the members, man by man, in
      behalf of the support, encouragement and protection of one of the nation&rsquo;s
      most valuable assets and industries&mdash;its literature. I have arguments
      with me, also a barrel, with liquid in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give me a chance. Get me the thanks of Congress. Don&rsquo;t wait for others;
      there isn&rsquo;t time. I have stayed away and let Congress alone for
      seventy-one years and I am entitled to thanks. Congress knows it perfectly
      well and I have long felt hurt that this quite proper and earned
      expression of gratitude has been merely felt by the House and never
      publicly uttered. Send me an order on the Sergeant-at-Arms quick. When
      shall I come? With love and a benediction.

     This was mainly a joke.  Mark Twain did not expect any &ldquo;thanks,&rdquo; but
     he did hope for access to the floor, which once, in an earlier day,
     had been accorded him.  We drove to the Capitol and he delivered his
     letter to &ldquo;Uncle Joe&rdquo; by hand.  &ldquo;Uncle Joe&rdquo; could not give him the
     privilege of the floor; the rules had become more stringent.  He
     declared they would hang him if he did such a thing.  He added that
     he had a private room down-stairs, where Mark Twain might establish
     headquarters, and that he would assign his colored servant, Neal, of
     long acquaintanceship with many of the members, to pass the word
     that Mark Twain was receiving.

     The result was a great success.  All that afternoon members of
     Congress poured into the Speaker&rsquo;s room and, in an atmosphere blue
     with tobacco smoke, Mark Twain talked the gospel of copyright to his
     heart&rsquo;s content.

     The bill did not come up for passage that session, but Mark Twain
     lived to see his afternoon&rsquo;s lobbying bring a return.  In 1909,
     Champ Clark, and those others who had gathered around him that
     afternoon, passed a measure that added fourteen years to the
     copyright term.

     The next letter refers to a proposed lobby of quite a different
     sort.

    <p>
      DEAR HELEN KELLER,&mdash;... You say, &ldquo;As a reformer, you know that ideas
      must be driven home again and again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, I know it; and by old experience I know that speeches and documents
      and public meetings are a pretty poor and lame way of accomplishing it.
      Last year I proposed a sane way&mdash;one which I had practiced with
      success for a quarter of a century&mdash;but I wasn&rsquo;t expecting it to get
      any attention, and it didn&rsquo;t.

      Give me a battalion of 200 winsome young girls and matrons, and let me
      tell them what to do and how to do it, and I will be responsible for
      shining results. If I could mass them on the stage in front of the
      audience and instruct them there, I could make a public meeting take hold
      of itself and do something really valuable for once. Not that the real
      instruction would be done there, for it wouldn&rsquo;t; it would be previously
      done privately, and merely repeated there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it isn&rsquo;t going to happen&mdash;the good old way will be stuck to:

      report, and a verbal description of the marvels the blind can do, and 17
      speeches&mdash;then the call upon all present who are still alive, to
      contribute. This hoary program was invented in the idiot asylum, and will
      never be changed. Its function is to breed hostility to good causes.

     They did meet somewhat later that winter in the friendly parlors of

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; appears, or with which the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
