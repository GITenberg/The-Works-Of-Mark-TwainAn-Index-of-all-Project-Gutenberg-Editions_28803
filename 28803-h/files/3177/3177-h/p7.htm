<center><h2>PREFATORY.</h2> </center>
<br>
<p>This book is merely a personal narrative, and not a
pretentious history or a philosophical dissertation. It is a
record of several years of variegated vagabondizing, and its
object is rather to help the resting reader while away an idle
hour than afflict him with metaphysics, or goad him with science.
Still, there is information in the volume; information concerning
an interesting episode in the history of the Far West, about
which no books have been written by persons who were on the
ground in person, and saw the happenings of the time with their
own eyes. I allude to the rise, growth and culmination of the
silver-mining fever in Nevada&mdash;a curious episode, in some
respects; the only one, of its peculiar kind, that has occurred
in the land; and the only one, indeed, that is likely to occur in
it.</p>

<p>Yes, take it all around, there is quite a good deal of
information in the book. I regret this very much; but really it
could not be helped: information appears to stew out of me
naturally, like the precious ottar of roses out of the otter.
Sometimes it has seemed to me that I would give worlds if I could
retain my facts; but it cannot be. The more I calk up the
sources, and the tighter I get, the more I leak wisdom.
Therefore, I can only claim indulgence at the hands of the
reader, not justification.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXI.</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>One of my comrades there&mdash;another of those victims of eighteen
years of unrequited toil and blighted hopes&mdash;was one of the
gentlest spirits that ever bore its patient cross in a weary
exile: grave and simple Dick Baker, pocket-miner of Dead-House
Gulch.&mdash;He was forty-six, gray as a rat, earnest, thoughtful,
slenderly educated, slouchily dressed and clay- soiled, but his
heart was finer metal than any gold his shovel ever brought to
light&mdash;than any, indeed, that ever was mined or minted.</p>

<p>Whenever he was out of luck and a little down-hearted, he
would fall to mourning over the loss of a wonderful cat he used
to own (for where women and children are not, men of kindly
impulses take up with pets, for they must love something). And he
always spoke of the strange sagacity of that cat with the air of
a man who believed in his secret heart that there was something
human about it&mdash;may be even supernatural.</p>

<p>I heard him talking about this animal once. He said:</p>

<a name="440"></a>
<br><br>

<img alt="440.jpg (18K)" src="images/440.jpg" height="300" width="265">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>"Gentlemen, I used to have a cat here, by the name of Tom
Quartz, which you'd a took an interest in I reckon&mdash;most any body
would. I had him here eight year&mdash;and he was the remarkablest cat
I ever see. He was a large gray one of the Tom specie, an' he had
more hard, natchral sense than any man in this camp&mdash;'n' a power
of dignity&mdash;he wouldn't let the Gov'ner of Californy be familiar
with him. He never ketched a rat in his life&mdash;'peared to be above
it. He never cared for nothing but mining. He knowed more about
mining, that cat did, than any man I ever, ever see. You couldn't
tell him noth'n 'bout placer diggin's&mdash;'n' as for pocket mining,
why he was just born for it.</p>

<p>"He would dig out after me an' Jim when we went over the hills
prospect'n', and he would trot along behind us for as much as
five mile, if we went so fur. An' he had the best judgment about
mining ground&mdash;why you never see anything like it. When we went
to work, he'd scatter a glance around, 'n' if he didn't think
much of the indications, he would give a look as much as to say,
'Well, I'll have to get you to excuse me,' 'n' without another
word he'd hyste his nose into the air 'n' shove for home. But if
the ground suited him, he would lay low 'n' keep dark till the
first pan was washed, 'n' then he would sidle up 'n' take a look,
an' if there was about six or seven grains of gold he was
satisfied&mdash;he didn't want no better prospect 'n' that&mdash;'n' then
he would lay down on our coats and snore like a steamboat till
we'd struck the pocket, an' then get up 'n' superintend. He was
nearly lightnin' on superintending.</p>

<p>"Well, bye an' bye, up comes this yer quartz excitement. Every
body was into it&mdash;every body was pick'n' 'n' blast'n' instead of
shovelin' dirt on the hill side&mdash;every body was put'n' down a
shaft instead of scrapin' the surface. Noth'n' would do Jim, but
we must tackle the ledges, too, 'n' so we did. We commenced
put'n' down a shaft, 'n' Tom Quartz he begin to wonder what in
the Dickens it was all about. He hadn't ever seen any mining like
that before, 'n' he was all upset, as you may say&mdash;he couldn't
come to a right understanding of it no way&mdash;it was too many for
him. He was down on it, too, you bet you&mdash;he was down on it
powerful&mdash;'n' always appeared to consider it the cussedest
foolishness out. But that cat, you know, was always agin new
fangled arrangements&mdash;somehow he never could abide'em. You know
how it is with old habits. But by an' by Tom Quartz begin to git
sort of reconciled a little, though he never could altogether
understand that eternal sinkin' of a shaft an' never pannin' out
any thing. At last he got to comin' down in the shaft, hisself,
to try to cipher it out. An' when he'd git the blues, 'n' feel
kind o'scruffy, 'n' aggravated 'n' disgusted&mdash;knowin' as he did,
that the bills was runnin' up all the time an' we warn't makin' a
cent&mdash;he would curl up on a gunny sack in the corner an' go to
sleep. Well, one day when the shaft was down about eight foot,
the rock got so hard that we had to put in a blast&mdash;the first
blast'n' we'd ever done since Tom Quartz was born. An' then we
lit the fuse 'n' clumb out 'n' got off 'bout fifty yards&mdash;'n'
forgot 'n' left Tom Quartz sound asleep on the gunny sack.</p>

<img alt="441.jpg (89K)" src="images/441.jpg" height="506" width="583">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>"In 'bout a minute we seen a puff of smoke bust up out of the
hole, 'n' then everything let go with an awful crash, 'n' about
four million ton of rocks 'n' dirt 'n' smoke 'n; splinters shot
up 'bout a mile an' a half into the air, an' by George, right in
the dead centre of it was old Tom Quartz a goin' end over end,
an' a snortin' an' a sneez'n', an' a clawin' an' a reachin' for
things like all possessed. But it warn't no use, you know, it
warn't no use. An' that was the last we see of him for about two
minutes 'n' a half, an' then all of a sudden it begin to rain
rocks and rubbage, an' directly he come down ker-whop about ten
foot off f'm where we stood Well, I reckon he was p'raps the
orneriest lookin' beast you ever see. One ear was sot back on his
neck, 'n' his tail was stove up, 'n' his eye-winkers was swinged
off, 'n' he was all blacked up with powder an' smoke, an' all
sloppy with mud 'n' slush f'm one end to the other.</p>

<p>"Well sir, it warn't no use to try to apologize&mdash;we couldn't
say a word. He took a sort of a disgusted look at hisself, 'n'
then he looked at us&mdash;an' it was just exactly the same as if he
had said&mdash;'Gents, may be you think it's smart to take advantage
of a cat that 'ain't had no experience of quartz minin', but I
think different'&mdash;an' then he turned on his heel 'n' marched off
home without ever saying another word.</p>

<a name="442"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="442.jpg (16K)" src="images/442.jpg" height="205" width="294">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>"That was jest his style. An' may be you won't believe it, but
after that you never see a cat so prejudiced agin quartz mining
as what he was. An' by an' bye when he did get to goin' down in
the shaft agin, you'd 'a been astonished at his sagacity. The
minute we'd tetch off a blast 'n' the fuse'd begin to sizzle,
he'd give a look as much as to say: 'Well, I'll have to git you
to excuse me,' an' it was surpris'n' the way he'd shin out of
that hole 'n' go f'r a tree. Sagacity? It ain't no name for it.
'Twas inspiration!"</p>

<p>I said, "Well, Mr. Baker, his prejudice against quartz-mining
was remarkable, considering how he came by it. Couldn't you ever
cure him of it?"</p>

<p>"Cure him! No! When Tom Quartz was sot once, he was always
sot&mdash;and you might a blowed him up as much as three million times
'n' you'd never a broken him of his cussed prejudice agin quartz
mining."</p>

<p>The affection and the pride that lit up Baker's face when he
delivered this tribute to the firmness of his humble friend of
other days, will always be a vivid memory with me.</p>

<p>At the end of two months we had never "struck" a pocket. We
had panned up and down the hillsides till they looked plowed like
a field; we could have put in a crop of grain, then, but there
would have been no way to get it to market. We got many good
"prospects," but when the gold gave out in the pan and we dug
down, hoping and longing, we found only emptiness&mdash;the pocket
that should have been there was as barren as our own.&mdash;At last we
shouldered our pans and shovels and struck out over the hills to
try new localities. We prospected around Angel's Camp, in
Calaveras county, during three weeks, but had no success. Then we
wandered on foot among the mountains, sleeping under the trees at
night, for the weather was mild, but still we remained as
centless as the last rose of summer. That is a poor joke, but it
is in pathetic harmony with the circumstances, since we were so
poor ourselves. In accordance with the custom of the country, our
door had always stood open and our board welcome to tramping
miners&mdash;they drifted along nearly every day, dumped their paust
shovels by the threshold and took "pot luck" with us&mdash;and now on
our own tramp we never found cold hospitality.</p>

<p>Our wanderings were wide and in many directions; and now I
could give the reader a vivid description of the Big Trees and
the marvels of the Yo Semite&mdash;but what has this reader done to me
that I should persecute him? I will deliver him into the hands of
less conscientious tourists and take his blessing. Let me be
charitable, though I fail in all virtues else.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Note: Some of the phrases in the above are mining
technicalities, purely, and may be a little obscure to the
general reader. In "placer diggings" the gold is scattered all
through the surface dirt; in "pocket" diggings it is concentrated
in one little spot; in "quartz" the gold is in a solid,
continuous vein of rock, enclosed between distinct walls of some
other kind of stone&mdash;and this is the most laborious and expensive
of all the different kinds of mining. "Prospecting" is hunting
for a "placer"; "indications" are signs of its presence; "panning
out" refers to the washing process by which the grains of gold
are separated from the dirt; a "prospect" is what one finds in
the first panful of dirt&mdash;and its value determines whether it is
a good or a bad prospect, and whether it is worth while to tarry
there or seek further.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXII.</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>After a three months' absence, I found myself in San Francisco
again, without a cent. When my credit was about exhausted, (for I
had become too mean and lazy, now, to work on a morning paper,
and there were no vacancies on the evening journals,) I was
created San Francisco correspondent of the Enterprise, and at the
end of five months I was out of debt, but my interest in my work
was gone; for my correspondence being a daily one, without rest
or respite, I got unspeakably tired of it. I wanted another
change. The vagabond instinct was strong upon me. Fortune favored
and I got a new berth and a delightful one. It was to go down to
the Sandwich Islands and write some letters for the Sacramento
Union, an excellent journal and liberal with employees.</p>

<p>We sailed in the propeller Ajax, in the middle of winter. The
almanac called it winter, distinctly enough, but the weather was
a compromise between spring and summer. Six days out of port, it
became summer altogether. We had some thirty passengers; among
them a cheerful soul by the name of Williams, and three sea-worn
old whaleship captains going down to join their vessels. These
latter played euchre in the smoking room day and night, drank
astonishing quantities of raw whisky without being in the least
affected by it, and were the happiest people I think I ever saw.
And then there was "the old Admiral&mdash;" a retired whaleman. He was
a roaring, terrific combination of wind and lightning and
thunder, and earnest, whole-souled profanity. But nevertheless he
was tender- hearted as a girl. He was a raving, deafening,
devastating typhoon, laying waste the cowering seas but with an
unvexed refuge in the centre where all comers were safe and at
rest. Nobody could know the "Admiral" without liking him; and in
a sudden and dire emergency I think no friend of his would know
which to choose&mdash;to be cursed by him or prayed for by a less
efficient person.</p>

<a name="445"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="445.jpg (65K)" src="images/445.jpg" height="559" width="403">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>His Title of "Admiral" was more strictly "official" than any
ever worn by a naval officer before or since, perhaps&mdash;for it was
the voluntary offering of a whole nation, and came direct from
the people themselves without any intermediate red tape&mdash;the
people of the Sandwich Islands. It was a title that came to him
freighted with affection, and honor, and appreciation of his
unpretending merit. And in testimony of the genuineness of the
title it was publicly ordained that an exclusive flag should be
devised for him and used solely to welcome his coming and wave
him God-speed in his going. From that time forth, whenever his
ship was signaled in the offing, or he catted his anchor and
stood out to sea, that ensign streamed from the royal halliards
on the parliament house and the nation lifted their hats to it
with spontaneous accord.</p>

<p>Yet he had never fired a gun or fought a battle in his life.
When I knew him on board the Ajax, he was seventy-two years old
and had plowed the salt water sixty-one of them. For sixteen
years he had gone in and out of the harbor of Honolulu in command
of a whaleship, and for sixteen more had been captain of a San
Francisco and Sandwich Island passenger packet and had never had
an accident or lost a vessel. The simple natives knew him for a
friend who never failed them, and regarded him as children regard
a father. It was a dangerous thing to oppress them when the
roaring Admiral was around.</p>

<p>Two years before I knew the Admiral, he had retired from the
sea on a competence, and had sworn a colossal nine-jointed oath
that he would "never go within smelling distance of the salt
water again as long as he lived." And he had conscientiously kept
it. That is to say, he considered he had kept it, and it would
have been more than dangerous to suggest to him, even in the
gentlest way, that making eleven long sea voyages, as a
passenger, during the two years that had transpired since he
"retired," was only keeping the general spirit of it and not the
strict letter.</p>

<p>The Admiral knew only one narrow line of conduct to pursue in
any and all cases where there was a fight, and that was to
shoulder his way straight in without an inquiry as to the rights
or the merits of it, and take the part of the weaker side.&mdash;And
this was the reason why he was always sure to be present at the
trial of any universally execrated criminal to oppress and
intimidate the jury with a vindictive pantomime of what he would
do to them if he ever caught them out of the box. And this was
why harried cats and outlawed dogs that knew him confidently took
sanctuary under his chair in time of trouble. In the beginning he
was the most frantic and bloodthirsty Union man that drew breath
in the shadow of the Flag; but the instant the Southerners began
to go down before the sweep of the Northern armies, he ran up the
Confederate colors and from that time till the end was a rampant
and inexorable secessionist.</p>

<p>He hated intemperance with a more uncompromising animosity
than any individual I have ever met, of either sex; and he was
never tired of storming against it and beseeching friends and
strangers alike to be wary and drink with moderation. And yet if
any creature had been guileless enough to intimate that his
absorbing nine gallons of "straight" whiskey during our voyage
was any fraction short of rigid or inflexible abstemiousness, in
that self-same moment the old man would have spun him to the
uttermost parts of the earth in the whirlwind of his wrath. Mind,
I am not saying his whisky ever affected his head or his legs,
for it did not, in even the slightest degree. He was a capacious
container, but he did not hold enough for that. He took a level
tumblerful of whisky every morning before he put his clothes
on&mdash;"to sweeten his bilgewater," he said.&mdash;He took another after
he got the most of his clothes on, "to settle his mind and give
him his bearings." He then shaved, and put on a clean shirt;
after which he recited the Lord's Prayer in a fervent, thundering
bass that shook the ship to her kelson and suspended all
conversation in the main cabin. Then, at this stage, being
invariably "by the head," or "by the stern," or "listed to port
or starboard," he took one more to "put him on an even keel so
that he would mind his hellum and not miss stays and go about,
every time he came up in the wind."&mdash;And now, his state-room door
swung open and the sun of his benignant face beamed redly out
upon men and women and children, and he roared his "Shipmets
a'hoy!" in a way that was calculated to wake the dead and
precipitate the final resurrection; and forth he strode, a
picture to look at and a presence to enforce attention. Stalwart
and portly; not a gray hair; broadbrimmed slouch hat; semi-sailor
toggery of blue navy flannel&mdash;roomy and ample; a stately expanse
of shirt-front and a liberal amount of black silk neck-cloth tied
with a sailor knot; large chain and imposing seals impending from
his fob; awe-inspiring feet, and "a hand like the hand of
Providence," as his whaling brethren expressed it; wrist-bands
and sleeves pushed back half way to the elbow, out of respect for
the warm weather, and exposing hairy arms, gaudy with red and
blue anchors, ships, and goddesses of liberty tattooed in India
ink. But these details were only secondary matters&mdash;his face was
the lodestone that chained the eye. It was a sultry disk, glowing
determinedly out through a weather beaten mask of mahogany, and
studded with warts, seamed with scars, "blazed" all over with
unfailing fresh slips of the razor; and with cheery eyes, under
shaggy brows, contemplating the world from over the back of a
gnarled crag of a nose that loomed vast and lonely out of the
undulating immensity that spread away from its foundations. At
his heels frisked the darling of his bachelor estate, his terrier
"Fan," a creature no larger than a squirrel. The main part of his
daily life was occupied in looking after "Fan," in a motherly
way, and doctoring her for a hundred ailments which existed only
in his imagination.</p>

<p>The Admiral seldom read newspapers; and when he did he never
believed anything they said. He read nothing, and believed in
nothing, but "The Old Guard," a secession periodical published in
New York. He carried a dozen copies of it with him, always, and
referred to them for all required information. If it was not
there, he supplied it himself, out of a bountiful fancy,
inventing history, names, dates, and every thing else necessary
to make his point good in an argument. Consequently he was a
formidable antagonist in a dispute. Whenever he swung clear of
the record and began to create history, the enemy was helpless
and had to surrender. Indeed, the enemy could not keep from
betraying some little spark of indignation at his manufactured
history&mdash;and when it came to indignation, that was the Admiral's
very "best hold." He was always ready for a political argument,
and if nobody started one he would do it himself. With his third
retort his temper would begin to rise, and within five minutes he
would be blowing a gale, and within fifteen his smoking-room
audience would be utterly stormed away and the old man left
solitary and alone, banging the table with his fist, kicking the
chairs, and roaring a hurricane of profanity. It got so, after a
while, that whenever the Admiral approached, with politics in his
eye, the passengers would drop out with quiet accord, afraid to
meet him; and he would camp on a deserted field.</p>

<a name="449"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="449.jpg (34K)" src="images/449.jpg" height="361" width="324">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>But he found his match at last, and before a full company. At
one time or another, everybody had entered the lists against him
and been routed, except the quiet passenger Williams. He had
never been able to get an expression of opinion out of him on
politics. But now, just as the Admiral drew near the door and the
company were about to slip out, Williams said:</p>

<p>"Admiral, are you certain about that circumstance concerning
the clergymen you mentioned the other day?"&mdash;referring to a piece
of the Admiral's manufactured history.</p>

<p>Every one was amazed at the man's rashness. The idea of
deliberately inviting annihilation was a thing incomprehensible.
The retreat came to a halt; then everybody sat down again
wondering, to await the upshot of it. The Admiral himself was as
surprised as any one. He paused in the door, with his red
handkerchief half raised to his sweating face, and contemplated
the daring reptile in the corner.</p>

<p>"Certain of it? Am I certain of it? Do you think I've been
lying about it? What do you take me for? Anybody that don't know
that circumstance, don't know anything; a child ought to know it.
Read up your history! Read it up&mdash;&mdash;-, and don't come asking a
man if he's certain about a bit of ABC stuff that the very
southern niggers know all about."</p>

<p>Here the Admiral's fires began to wax hot, the atmosphere
thickened, the coming earthquake rumbled, he began to thunder and
lighten. Within three minutes his volcano was in full irruption
and he was discharging flames and ashes of indignation, belching
black volumes of foul history aloft, and vomiting red-hot
torrents of profanity from his crater. Meantime Williams sat
silent, and apparently deeply and earnestly interested in what
the old man was saying. By and by, when the lull came, he said in
the most deferential way, and with the gratified air of a man who
has had a mystery cleared up which had been puzzling him
uncomfortably:</p>

<p>"Now I understand it. I always thought I knew that piece of
history well enough, but was still afraid to trust it, because
there was not that convincing particularity about it that one
likes to have in history; but when you mentioned every name, the
other day, and every date, and every little circumstance, in
their just order and sequence, I said to myself, this sounds
something like&mdash;this is history&mdash;this is putting it in a shape
that gives a man confidence; and I said to myself afterward, I
will just ask the Admiral if he is perfectly certain about the
details, and if he is I will come out and thank him for clearing
this matter up for me. And that is what I want to do now&mdash;for
until you set that matter right it was nothing but just a
confusion in my mind, without head or tail to it."</p>

<p>Nobody ever saw the Admiral look so mollified before, and so
pleased. Nobody had ever received his bogus history as gospel
before; its genuineness had always been called in question either
by words or looks; but here was a man that not only swallowed it
all down, but was grateful for the dose. He was taken a back; he
hardly knew what to say; even his profanity failed him. Now,
Williams continued, modestly and earnestly:</p>

<p>"But Admiral, in saying that this was the first stone thrown,
and that this precipitated the war, you have overlooked a
circumstance which you are perfectly familiar with, but which has
escaped your memory. Now I grant you that what you have stated is
correct in every detail&mdash;to wit: that on the 16th of October,
1860, two Massachusetts clergymen, named Waite and Granger, went
in disguise to the house of John Moody, in Rockport, at dead of
night, and dragged forth two southern women and their two little
children, and after tarring and feathering them conveyed them to
Boston and burned them alive in the State House square; and I
also grant your proposition that this deed is what led to the
secession of South Carolina on the 20th of December following.
Very well." [Here the company were pleasantly surprised to hear
Williams proceed to come back at the Admiral with his own
invincible weapon&mdash;clean, pure, manufactured history, without a
word of truth in it.] "Very well, I say. But Admiral, why
overlook the Willis and Morgan case in South Carolina? You are
too well informed a man not to know all about that circumstance.
Your arguments and your conversations have shown you to be
intimately conversant with every detail of this national quarrel.
You develop matters of history every day that show plainly that
you are no smatterer in it, content to nibble about the surface,
but a man who has searched the depths and possessed yourself of
everything that has a bearing upon the great question. Therefore,
let me just recall to your mind that Willis and Morgan
case&mdash;though I see by your face that the whole thing is already
passing through your memory at this moment. On the 12th of
August, 1860, two months before the Waite and Granger affair, two
South Carolina clergymen, named John H. Morgan and Winthrop L.
Willis, one a Methodist and the other an Old School Baptist,
disguised themselves, and went at midnight to the house of a
planter named Thompson&mdash;Archibald F. Thompson, Vice President
under Thomas Jefferson,&mdash;and took thence, at midnight, his
widowed aunt, (a Northern woman,) and her adopted child, an
orphan&mdash;named Mortimer Highie, afflicted with epilepsy and
suffering at the time from white swelling on one of his legs, and
compelled to walk on crutches in consequence; and the two
ministers, in spite of the pleadings of the victims, dragged them
to the bush, tarred and feathered them, and afterward burned them
at the stake in the city of Charleston. You remember perfectly
well what a stir it made; you remember perfectly well that even
the Charleston Courier stigmatized the act as being unpleasant,
of questionable propriety, and scarcely justifiable, and likewise
that it would not be matter of surprise if retaliation ensued.
And you remember also, that this thing was the cause of the
Massachusetts outrage. Who, indeed, were the two Massachusetts
ministers? and who were the two Southern women they burned? I do
not need to remind you, Admiral, with your intimate knowledge of
history, that Waite was the nephew of the woman burned in
Charleston; that Granger was her cousin in the second degree, and
that the woman they burned in Boston was the wife of John H.
Morgan, and the still loved but divorced wife of Winthrop L.
Willis. Now, Admiral, it is only fair that you should acknowledge
that the first provocation came from the Southern preachers and
that the Northern ones were justified in retaliating. In your
arguments you never yet have shown the least disposition to
withhold a just verdict or be in anywise unfair, when
authoritative history condemned your position, and therefore I
have no hesitation in asking you to take the original blame from
the Massachusetts ministers, in this matter, and transfer it to
the South Carolina clergymen where it justly belongs."</p>

<p>The Admiral was conquered. This sweet spoken creature who
swallowed his fraudulent history as if it were the bread of life;
basked in his furious blasphemy as if it were generous sunshine;
found only calm, even-handed justice in his rampart partisanship;
and flooded him with invented history so sugarcoated with
flattery and deference that there was no rejecting it, was "too
many" for him. He stammered some awkward, profane sentences about
the&mdash;&mdash;-Willis and Morgan business having escaped his memory, but
that he "remembered it now," and then, under pretence of giving
Fan some medicine for an imaginary cough, drew out of the battle
and went away, a vanquished man. Then cheers and laughter went
up, and Williams, the ship's benefactor was a hero. The news went
about the vessel, champagne was ordered, and enthusiastic
reception instituted in the smoking room, and everybody flocked
thither to shake hands with the conqueror. The wheelman said
afterward, that the Admiral stood up behind the pilot house and
"ripped and cursed all to himself" till he loosened the
smokestack guys and becalmed the mainsail.</p>

<p>The Admiral's power was broken. After that, if he began
argument, somebody would bring Williams, and the old man would
grow weak and begin to quiet down at once. And as soon as he was
done, Williams in his dulcet, insinuating way, would invent some
history (referring for proof, to the old man's own excellent
memory and to copies of "The Old Guard" known not to be in his
possession) that would turn the tables completely and leave the
Admiral all abroad and helpless. By and by he came to so dread
Williams and his gilded tongue that he would stop talking when he
saw him approach, and finally ceased to mention politics
altogether, and from that time forward there was entire peace and
serenity in the ship.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIII.</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>On a certain bright morning the Islands hove in sight, lying
low on the lonely sea, and everybody climbed to the upper deck to
look. After two thousand miles of watery solitude the vision was
a welcome one. As we approached, the imposing promontory of
Diamond Head rose up out of the ocean its rugged front softened
by the hazy distance, and presently the details of the land began
to make themselves manifest: first the line of beach; then the
plumed coacoanut trees of the tropics; then cabins of the
natives; then the white town of Honolulu, said to contain between
twelve and fifteen thousand inhabitants spread over a dead level;
with streets from twenty to thirty feet wide, solid and level as
a floor, most of them straight as a line and few as crooked as a
corkscrew.</p>

<a name="455"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="455.jpg (98K)" src="images/455.jpg" height="597" width="458">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The further I traveled through the town the better I liked it.
Every step revealed a new contrast&mdash;disclosed something I was
unaccustomed to. In place of the grand mud-colored brown fronts
of San Francisco, I saw dwellings built of straw, adobies, and
cream-colored pebble-and-shell- conglomerated coral, cut into
oblong blocks and laid in cement; also a great number of neat
white cottages, with green window-shutters; in place of front
yards like billiard-tables with iron fences around them, I saw
these homes surrounded by ample yards, thickly clad with green
grass, and shaded by tall trees, through whose dense foliage the
sun could scarcely penetrate; in place of the customary geranium,
calla lily, etc., languishing in dust and general debility, I saw
luxurious banks and thickets of flowers, fresh as a meadow after
a rain, and glowing with the richest dyes; in place of the dingy
horrors of San Francisco's pleasure grove, the "Willows," I saw
huge-bodied, wide-spreading forest trees, with strange names and
stranger appearance&mdash;trees that cast a shadow like a
thunder-cloud, and were able to stand alone without being tied to
green poles; in place of gold fish, wiggling around in glass
globes, assuming countless shades and degrees of distortion
through the magnifying and diminishing qualities of their
transparent prison houses, I saw cats&mdash;Tom-cats, Mary Ann cats,
long-tailed cats, bob-tailed cats, blind cats, one-eyed cats,
wall-eyed cats, cross-eyed cats, gray cats, black cats, white
cats, yellow cats, striped cats, spotted cats, tame cats, wild
cats, singed cats, individual cats, groups of cats, platoons of
cats, companies of cats, regiments of cats, armies of cats,
multitudes of cats, millions of cats, and all of them sleek, fat,
lazy and sound asleep. I looked on a multitude of people, some
white, in white coats, vests, pantaloons, even white cloth shoes,
made snowy with chalk duly laid on every morning; but the
majority of the people were almost as dark as negroes&mdash;women with
comely features, fine black eyes, rounded forms, inclining to the
voluptuous, clad in a single bright red or white garment that
fell free and unconfined from shoulder to heel, long black hair
falling loose, gypsy hats, encircled with wreaths of natural
flowers of a brilliant carmine tint; plenty of dark men in
various costumes, and some with nothing on but a battered
stove-pipe hat tilted on the nose, and a very scant
breech-clout;&mdash;certain smoke-dried children were clothed in
nothing but sunshine&mdash;a very neat fitting and picturesque apparel
indeed.</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>In place of roughs and rowdies staring and blackguarding on
the corners, I saw long-haired, saddle-colored Sandwich Island
maidens sitting on the ground in the shade of corner houses,
gazing indolently at whatever or whoever happened along; instead
of wretched cobble-stone pavements, I walked on a firm foundation
of coral, built up from the bottom of the sea by the absurd but
persevering insect of that name, with a light layer of lava and
cinders overlying the coral, belched up out of fathomless
perdition long ago through the seared and blackened crater that
stands dead and harmless in the distance now; instead of cramped
and crowded street-cars, I met dusky native women sweeping by,
free as the wind, on fleet horses and astride, with gaudy
riding-sashes, streaming like banners behind them; instead of the
combined stenches of Chinadom and Brannan street
slaughter-houses, I breathed the balmy fragrance of jessamine,
oleander, and the Pride of India; in place of the hurry and
bustle and noisy confusion of San Francisco, I moved in the midst
of a Summer calm as tranquil as dawn in the Garden of Eden; in
place of the Golden City's skirting sand hills and the placid
bay, I saw on the one side a frame-work of tall, precipitous
mountains close at hand, clad in refreshing green, and cleft by
deep, cool, chasm-like valleys&mdash;and in front the grand sweep of
the ocean; a brilliant, transparent green near the shore, bound
and bordered by a long white line of foamy spray dashing against
the reef, and further out the dead blue water of the deep sea,
flecked with "white caps," and in the far horizon a single,
lonely sail&mdash;a mere accent-mark to emphasize a slumberous calm
and a solitude that were without sound or limit. When the sun
sunk down&mdash;the one intruder from other realms and persistent in
suggestions of them&mdash;it was tranced luxury to sit in the perfumed
air and forget that there was any world but these enchanted
islands.</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>It was such ecstacy to dream, and dream&mdash;till you got a
bite. A scorpion bite. Then the first duty was to get up out of the
grass and kill the scorpion; and the next to bathe the bitten
place with alcohol or brandy; and the next to resolve to keep out
of the grass in future. Then came an adjournment to the
bed-chamber and the pastime of writing up the day's journal with
one hand and the destruction of mosquitoes with the other&mdash;a
whole community of them at a slap. Then, observing an enemy
approaching,&mdash;a hairy tarantula on stilts&mdash;why not set the
spittoon on him? It is done, and the projecting ends of his paws
give a luminous idea of the magnitude of his reach. Then to bed
and become a promenade for a centipede with forty-two legs on a
side and every foot hot enough to burn a hole through a raw-hide.
More soaking with alcohol, and a resolution to examine the bed
before entering it, in future. Then wait, and suffer, till all
the mosquitoes in the neighborhood have crawled in under the bar,
then slip out quickly, shut them in and sleep peacefully on the
floor till morning. Meantime it is comforting to curse the
tropics in occasional wakeful intervals.</p>

<p>We had an abundance of fruit in Honolulu, of course. Oranges,
pine- apples, bananas, strawberries, lemons, limes, mangoes,
guavas, melons, and a rare and curious luxury called the
chirimoya, which is deliciousness itself. Then there is the
tamarind. I thought tamarinds were made to eat, but that was
probably not the idea. I ate several, and it seemed to me that
they were rather sour that year. They pursed up my lips, till
they resembled the stem-end of a tomato, and I had to take my
sustenance through a quill for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>They sharpened my teeth till I could have shaved with them,
and gave them a "wire edge" that I was afraid would stay; but a
citizen said "no, it will come off when the enamel does"&mdash;which
was comforting, at any rate. I found, afterward, that only
strangers eat tamarinds&mdash;but they only eat them once.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIV.</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>In my diary of our third day in Honolulu, I find this:</p>

<p>I am probably the most sensitive man in Hawaii
to-night&mdash;especially about sitting down in the presence of my
betters. I have ridden fifteen or twenty miles on horse-back
since 5 P.M. and to tell the honest truth, I have a delicacy
about sitting down at all.</p>

<p>An excursion to Diamond Head and the King's Coacoanut Grove
was planned to-day&mdash;time, 4:30 P.M.&mdash;the party to consist of half
a dozen gentlemen and three ladies. They all started at the
appointed hour except myself. I was at the Government prison,
(with Captain Fish and another whaleship- skipper, Captain
Phillips,) and got so interested in its examination that I did
not notice how quickly the time was passing. Somebody remarked
that it was twenty minutes past five o'clock, and that woke me
up. It was a fortunate circumstance that Captain Phillips was
along with his "turn out," as he calls a top-buggy that Captain
Cook brought here in 1778, and a horse that was here when Captain
Cook came. Captain Phillips takes a just pride in his driving and
in the speed of his horse, and to his passion for displaying them
I owe it that we were only sixteen minutes coming from the prison
to the American Hotel&mdash;a distance which has been estimated to be
over half a mile. But it took some fearful driving. The Captain's
whip came down fast, and the blows started so much dust out of
the horse's hide that during the last half of the journey we rode
through an impenetrable fog, and ran by a pocket compass in the
hands of Captain Fish, a whaler of twenty-six years experience,
who sat there through the perilous voyage as self-possessed as if
he had been on the euchre-deck of his own ship, and calmly said,
"Port your helm&mdash;port," from time to time, and "Hold her a little
free&mdash;steady&mdash;so&mdash;so," and "Luff&mdash;hard down to starboard!" and
never once lost his presence of mind or betrayed the least
anxiety by voice or manner. When we came to anchor at last, and
Captain Phillips looked at his watch and said, "Sixteen
minutes&mdash;I told you it was in her! that's over three miles an
hour!" I could see he felt entitled to a compliment, and so I
said I had never seen lightning go like that horse. And I never
had.</p>

<p>The landlord of the American said the party had been gone
nearly an hour, but that he could give me my choice of several
horses that could overtake them. I said, never mind&mdash;I preferred
a safe horse to a fast one&mdash;I would like to have an excessively
gentle horse&mdash;a horse with no spirit whatever&mdash;a lame one, if he
had such a thing. Inside of five minutes I was mounted, and
perfectly satisfied with my outfit. I had no time to label him
"This is a horse," and so if the public took him for a sheep I
cannot help it. I was satisfied, and that was the main thing. I
could see that he had as many fine points as any man's horse, and
so I hung my hat on one of them, behind the saddle, and swabbed
the perspiration from my face and started. I named him after this
island, "Oahu" (pronounced O-waw-hee). The first gate he came to
he started in; I had neither whip nor spur, and so I simply
argued the case with him. He resisted argument, but ultimately
yielded to insult and abuse. He backed out of that gate and
steered for another one on the other side of the street. I
triumphed by my former process. Within the next six hundred yards
he crossed the street fourteen times and attempted thirteen
gates, and in the meantime the tropical sun was beating down and
threatening to cave the top of my head in, and I was literally
dripping with perspiration. He abandoned the gate business after
that and went along peaceably enough, but absorbed in meditation.
I noticed this latter circumstance, and it soon began to fill me
with apprehension. I said to my self, this creature is planning
some new outrage, some fresh deviltry or other&mdash;no horse ever
thought over a subject so profoundly as this one is doing just
for nothing. The more this thing preyed upon my mind the more
uneasy I became, until the suspense became almost unbearable and
I dismounted to see if there was anything wild in his eye&mdash;for I
had heard that the eye of this noblest of our domestic animals is
very expressive.</p>

<a name="461"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="461.jpg (86K)" src="images/461.jpg" height="479" width="639">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>I cannot describe what a load of anxiety was lifted from my
mind when I found that he was only asleep. I woke him up and
started him into a faster walk, and then the villainy of his
nature came out again. He tried to climb over a stone wall, five
or six feet high. I saw that I must apply force to this horse,
and that I might as well begin first as last. I plucked a stout
switch from a tamarind tree, and the moment he saw it, he
surrendered. He broke into a convulsive sort of a canter, which
had three short steps in it and one long one, and reminded me
alternately of the clattering shake of the great earthquake, and
the sweeping plunging of the Ajax in a storm.</p>

<p>And now there can be no fitter occasion than the present to
pronounce a left-handed blessing upon the man who invented the
American saddle. There is no seat to speak of about it&mdash;one might
as well sit in a shovel- -and the stirrups are nothing but an
ornamental nuisance. If I were to write down here all the abuse I
expended on those stirrups, it would make a large book, even
without pictures. Sometimes I got one foot so far through, that
the stirrup partook of the nature of an anklet; sometimes both
feet were through, and I was handcuffed by the legs; and
sometimes my feet got clear out and left the stirrups wildly
dangling about my shins. Even when I was in proper position and
carefully balanced upon the balls of my feet, there was no
comfort in it, on account of my nervous dread that they were
going to slip one way or the other in a moment. But the subject
is too exasperating to write about.</p>

<p>A mile and a half from town, I came to a grove of tall
cocoanut trees, with clean, branchless stems reaching straight up
sixty or seventy feet and topped with a spray of green foliage
sheltering clusters of cocoa- nuts&mdash;not more picturesque than a
forest of collossal ragged parasols, with bunches of magnified
grapes under them, would be.</p>

<p>I once heard a gouty northern invalid say that a cocoanut tree
might be poetical, possibly it was; but it looked like a
feather-duster struck by lightning. I think that describes it
better than a picture&mdash;and yet, without any question, there is
something fascinating about a cocoa-nut tree&mdash;and graceful,
too.</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>About a dozen cottages, some frame and the others of native
grass, nestled sleepily in the shade here and there. The grass
cabins are of a grayish color, are shaped much like our own
cottages, only with higher and steeper roofs usually, and are
made of some kind of weed strongly bound together in bundles. The
roofs are very thick, and so are the walls; the latter have
square holes in them for windows. At a little distance these
cabins have a furry appearance, as if they might be made of bear
skins. They are very cool and pleasant inside. The King's flag
was flying from the roof of one of the cottages, and His Majesty
was probably within. He owns the whole concern thereabouts, and
passes his time there frequently, on sultry days "laying off."
The spot is called "The King's Grove."</p>

<p>Near by is an interesting ruin&mdash;the meagre remains of an
ancient heathen temple&mdash;a place where human sacrifices were
offered up in those old bygone days when the simple child of
nature, yielding momentarily to sin when sorely tempted,
acknowledged his error when calm reflection had shown it him, and
came forward with noble frankness and offered up his grandmother
as an atoning sacrifice&mdash;in those old days when the luckless
sinner could keep on cleansing his conscience and achieving
periodical happiness as long as his relations held out; long,
long before the missionaries braved a thousand privations to come
and make them permanently miserable by telling them how beautiful
and how blissful a place heaven is, and how nearly impossible it
is to get there; and showed the poor native how dreary a place
perdition is and what unnecessarily liberal facilities there are
for going to it; showed him how, in his ignorance he had gone and
fooled away all his kinfolks to no purpose; showed him what
rapture it is to work all day long for fifty cents to buy food
for next day with, as compared with fishing for pastime and
lolling in the shade through eternal Summer, and eating of the
bounty that nobody labored to provide but Nature. How sad it is
to think of the multitudes who have gone to their graves in this
beautiful island and never knew there was a hell!</p>

<p>This ancient temple was built of rough blocks of lava, and was
simply a roofless inclosure a hundred and thirty feet long and
seventy wide&mdash;nothing but naked walls, very thick, but not much
higher than a man's head. They will last for ages no doubt, if
left unmolested. Its three altars and other sacred appurtenances
have crumbled and passed away years ago. It is said that in the
old times thousands of human beings were slaughtered here, in the
presence of naked and howling savages. If these mute stones could
speak, what tales they could tell, what pictures they could
describe, of fettered victims writhing under the knife; of massed
forms straining forward out of the gloom, with ferocious faces
lit up by the sacrificial fires; of the background of ghostly
trees; of the dark pyramid of Diamond Head standing sentinel over
the uncanny scene, and the peaceful moon looking down upon it
through rifts in the cloud-rack!</p>

<p>When Kamehameha (pronounced Ka-may-ha-may-ah) the Great&mdash;who
was a sort of a Napoleon in military genius and uniform
success&mdash;invaded this island of Oahu three quarters of a century
ago, and exterminated the army sent to oppose him, and took full
and final possession of the country, he searched out the dead
body of the King of Oahu, and those of the principal chiefs, and
impaled their heads on the walls of this temple.</p>

<p>Those were savage times when this old slaughter-house was in
its prime. The King and the chiefs ruled the common herd with a
rod of iron; made them gather all the provisions the masters
needed; build all the houses and temples; stand all the expenses,
of whatever kind; take kicks and cuffs for thanks; drag out lives
well flavored with misery, and then suffer death for trifling
offences or yield up their lives on the sacrificial altars to
purchase favors from the gods for their hard rulers. The
missionaries have clothed them, educated them, broken up the
tyrannous authority of their chiefs, and given them freedom and
the right to enjoy whatever their hands and brains produce with
equal laws for all, and punishment for all alike who transgress
them. The contrast is so strong&mdash;the benefit conferred upon this
people by the missionaries is so prominent, so palpable and so
unquestionable, that the frankest compliment I can pay them, and
the best, is simply to point to the condition of the Sandwich
Islanders of Captain Cook's time, and their condition to-day.</p>

<p>Their work speaks for itself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXV.</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>By and by, after a rugged climb, we halted on the summit of a
hill which commanded a far-reaching view. The moon rose and
flooded mountain and valley and ocean with a mellow radiance, and
out of the shadows of the foliage the distant lights of Honolulu
glinted like an encampment of fireflies. The air was heavy with
the fragrance of flowers. The halt was brief.&mdash;Gayly laughing and
talking, the party galloped on, and I clung to the pommel and
cantered after. Presently we came to a place where no grass
grew&mdash;a wide expanse of deep sand. They said it was an old battle
ground. All around everywhere, not three feet apart, the bleached
bones of men gleamed white in the moonlight. We picked up a lot
of them for mementoes. I got quite a number of arm bones and leg
bones&mdash;of great chiefs, may be, who had fought savagely in that
fearful battle in the old days, when blood flowed like wine where
we now stood&mdash;and wore the choicest of them out on Oahu
afterward, trying to make him go. All sorts of bones could be
found except skulls; but a citizen said, irreverently, that there
had been an unusual number of "skull-hunters" there lately&mdash;a
species of sportsmen I had never heard of before.</p>

<p>Nothing whatever is known about this place&mdash;its story is a
secret that will never be revealed. The oldest natives make no
pretense of being possessed of its history. They say these bones
were here when they were children. They were here when their
grandfathers were children&mdash;but how they came here, they can only
conjecture. Many people believe this spot to be an ancient
battle-ground, and it is usual to call it so; and they believe
that these skeletons have lain for ages just where their
proprietors fell in the great fight. Other people believe that
Kamehameha I. fought his first battle here. On this point, I have
heard a story, which may have been taken from one of the numerous
books which have been written concerning these islands&mdash;I do not
know where the narrator got it. He said that when Kamehameha (who
was at first merely a subordinate chief on the island of Hawaii),
landed here, he brought a large army with him, and encamped at
Waikiki. The Oahuans marched against him, and so confident were
they of success that they readily acceded to a demand of their
priests that they should draw a line where these bones now lie,
and take an oath that, if forced to retreat at all, they would
never retreat beyond this boundary. The priests told them that
death and everlasting punishment would overtake any who violated
the oath, and the march was resumed. Kamehameha drove them back
step by step; the priests fought in the front rank and exhorted
them both by voice and inspiriting example to remember their
oath&mdash;to die, if need be, but never cross the fatal line. The
struggle was manfully maintained, but at last the chief priest
fell, pierced to the heart with a spear, and the unlucky omen
fell like a blight upon the brave souls at his back; with a
triumphant shout the invaders pressed forward&mdash;the line was
crossed&mdash;the offended gods deserted the despairing army, and,
accepting the doom their perjury had brought upon them, they
broke and fled over the plain where Honolulu stands now&mdash;up the
beautiful Nuuanu Valley&mdash;paused a moment, hemmed in by
precipitous mountains on either hand and the frightful precipice
of the Pari in front, and then were driven over&mdash;a sheer plunge
of six hundred feet!</p>

<p>The story is pretty enough, but Mr. Jarves' excellent history
says the Oahuans were intrenched in Nuuanu Valley; that
Kamehameha ousted them, routed them, pursued them up the valley
and drove them over the precipice. He makes no mention of our
bone-yard at all in his book.</p>

<p>Impressed by the profound silence and repose that rested over
the beautiful landscape, and being, as usual, in the rear, I gave
voice to my thoughts. I said:</p>

<p>"What a picture is here slumbering in the solemn glory of the
moon! How strong the rugged outlines of the dead volcano stand
out against the clear sky! What a snowy fringe marks the bursting
of the surf over the long, curved reef! How calmly the dim city
sleeps yonder in the plain! How soft the shadows lie upon the
stately mountains that border the dream-haunted Mauoa Valley!
What a grand pyramid of billowy clouds towers above the storied
Pari! How the grim warriors of the past seem flocking in ghostly
squadrons to their ancient battlefield again&mdash;how the wails of
the dying well up from the&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this point the horse called Oahu sat down in the sand. Sat
down to listen, I suppose. Never mind what he heard, I stopped
apostrophising and convinced him that I was not a man to allow
contempt of Court on the part of a horse. I broke the back-bone
of a Chief over his rump and set out to join the cavalcade
again.</p>

<img alt="467.jpg (33K)" src="images/467.jpg" height="328" width="342">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Very considerably fagged out we arrived in town at 9 o'clock
at night, myself in the lead&mdash;for when my horse finally came to
understand that he was homeward bound and hadn't far to go, he
turned his attention strictly to business.</p>

<p>This is a good time to drop in a paragraph of information.
There is no regular livery stable in Honolulu, or, indeed, in any
part of the Kingdom of Hawaii; therefore unless you are
acquainted with wealthy residents (who all have good horses), you
must hire animals of the wretchedest description from the
Kanakas. (i.e. natives.) Any horse you hire, even though it be
from a white man, is not often of much account, because it will
be brought in for you from some ranch, and has necessarily been
leading a hard life. If the Kanakas who have been caring for him
(inveterate riders they are) have not ridden him half to death
every day themselves, you can depend upon it they have been doing
the same thing by proxy, by clandestinely hiring him out. At
least, so I am informed. The result is, that no horse has a
chance to eat, drink, rest, recuperate, or look well or feel
well, and so strangers go about the Islands mounted as I was
to-day.</p>

<p>In hiring a horse from a Kanaka, you must have all your eyes
about you, because you can rest satisfied that you are dealing
with a shrewd unprincipled rascal. You may leave your door open
and your trunk unlocked as long as you please, and he will not
meddle with your property; he has no important vices and no
inclination to commit robbery on a large scale; but if he can get
ahead of you in the horse business, he will take a genuine
delight in doing it. This traits is characteristic of horse
jockeys, the world over, is it not? He will overcharge you if he
can; he will hire you a fine-looking horse at night
(anybody's&mdash;may be the King's, if the royal steed be in
convenient view), and bring you the mate to my Oahu in the
morning, and contend that it is the same animal. If you make
trouble, he will get out by saying it was not himself who made
the bargain with you, but his brother, "who went out in the
country this morning." They have always got a "brother" to shift
the responsibility upon. A victim said to one of these fellows
one day:</p>

<p>"But I know I hired the horse of you, because I noticed that
scar on your cheek."</p>

<p>The reply was not bad: "Oh, yes&mdash;yes&mdash;my brother all same&mdash;we
twins!"</p>

<img alt="469.jpg (81K)" src="images/469.jpg" height="605" width="411">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>A friend of mine, J. Smith, hired a horse yesterday, the
Kanaka warranting him to be in excellent condition.</p>

<p>Smith had a saddle and blanket of his own, and he ordered the
Kanaka to put these on the horse. The Kanaka protested that he
was perfectly willing to trust the gentleman with the saddle that
was already on the animal, but Smith refused to use it. The
change was made; then Smith noticed that the Kanaka had only
changed the saddles, and had left the original blanket on the
horse; he said he forgot to change the blankets, and so, to cut
the bother short, Smith mounted and rode away. The horse went
lame a mile from town, and afterward got to cutting up some
extraordinary capers. Smith got down and took off the saddle, but
the blanket stuck fast to the horse&mdash;glued to a procession of raw
places. The Kanaka's mysterious conduct stood explained.</p>

<a name="470"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="470.jpg (33K)" src="images/470.jpg" height="332" width="331">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Another friend of mine bought a pretty good horse from a
native, a day or two ago, after a tolerably thorough examination
of the animal. He discovered today that the horse was as blind as
a bat, in one eye. He meant to have examined that eye, and came
home with a general notion that he had done it; but he remembers
now that every time he made the attempt his attention was called
to something else by his victimizer.</p>

<p>One more instance, and then I will pass to something else. I
am informed that when a certain Mr. L., a visiting stranger, was
here, he bought a pair of very respectable-looking match horses
from a native. They were in a little stable with a partition
through the middle of it&mdash;one horse in each apartment. Mr. L.
examined one of them critically through a window (the Kanaka's
"brother" having gone to the country with the key), and then went
around the house and examined the other through a window on the
other side. He said it was the neatest match he had ever seen,
and paid for the horses on the spot. Whereupon the Kanaka
departed to join his brother in the country. The fellow had
shamefully swindled L. There was only one "match" horse, and he
had examined his starboard side through one window and his port
side through another! I decline to believe this story, but I give
it because it is worth something as a fanciful illustration of a
fixed fact&mdash;namely, that the Kanaka horse- jockey is fertile in
invention and elastic in conscience.</p>

<p>You can buy a pretty good horse for forty or fifty dollars,
and a good enough horse for all practical purposes for two
dollars and a half. I estimate "Oahu" to be worth somewhere in
the neighborhood of thirty-five cents. A good deal better animal
than he is was sold here day before yesterday for a dollar and
seventy-five cents, and sold again to-day for two dollars and
twenty-five cents; Williams bought a handsome and lively little
pony yesterday for ten dollars; and about the best common horse
on the island (and he is a really good one) sold yesterday, with
Mexican saddle and bridle, for seventy dollars&mdash;a horse which is
well and widely known, and greatly respected for his speed, good
disposition and everlasting bottom.</p>

<p>You give your horse a little grain once a day; it comes from
San Francisco, and is worth about two cents a pound; and you give
him as much hay as he wants; it is cut and brought to the market
by natives, and is not very good it is baled into long, round
bundles, about the size of a large man; one of them is stuck by
the middle on each end of a six foot pole, and the Kanaka
shoulders the pole and walks about the streets between the
upright bales in search of customers. These hay bales, thus
carried, have a general resemblance to a colossal capital
'H.'</p>

<a name="471"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="471.jpg (59K)" src="images/471.jpg" height="473" width="528">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The hay-bundles cost twenty-five cents apiece, and one will
last a horse about a day. You can get a horse for a song, a
week's hay for another song, and you can turn your animal loose
among the luxuriant grass in your neighbor's broad front yard
without a song at all&mdash;you do it at midnight, and stable the
beast again before morning. You have been at no expense thus far,
but when you come to buy a saddle and bridle they will cost you
from twenty to thirty-five dollars. You can hire a horse, saddle
and bridle at from seven to ten dollars a week, and the owner
will take care of them at his own expense.</p>

<p>It is time to close this day's record&mdash;bed time. As I prepare
for sleep, a rich voice rises out of the still night, and, far as
this ocean rock is toward the ends of the earth, I recognize a
familiar home air. But the words seem somewhat out of joint:</p>

<p>"Waikiki lantoni oe Kaa hooly hooly wawhoo."</p>

<p>Translated, that means "When we were marching through
Georgia."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVI.</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>Passing through the market place we saw that feature of
Honolulu under its most favorable auspices&mdash;that is, in the full
glory of Saturday afternoon, which is a festive day with the
natives. The native girls by twos and threes and parties of a
dozen, and sometimes in whole platoons and companies, went
cantering up and down the neighboring streets astride of fleet
but homely horses, and with their gaudy riding habits streaming
like banners behind them. Such a troop of free and easy riders,
in their natural home, the saddle, makes a gay and graceful
spectacle. The riding habit I speak of is simply a long, broad
scarf, like a tavern table cloth brilliantly colored, wrapped
around the loins once, then apparently passed between the limbs
and each end thrown backward over the same, and floating and
flapping behind on both sides beyond the horse's tail like a
couple of fancy flags; then, slipping the stirrup-irons between
her toes, the girl throws her chest forward, sits up like a
Major General and goes sweeping by like the wind.</p>

<a name="474"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="474.jpg (88K)" src="images/474.jpg" height="510" width="608">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The girls put on all the finery they can on Saturday
afternoon&mdash;fine black silk robes; flowing red ones that nearly
put your eyes out; others as white as snow; still others that
discount the rainbow; and they wear their hair in nets, and trim
their jaunty hats with fresh flowers, and encircle their dusky
throats with home-made necklaces of the brilliant
vermillion-tinted blossom of the ohia; and they fill the markets
and the adjacent street with their bright presences, and smell
like a rag factory on fire with their offensive cocoanut oil.</p>

<p>Occasionally you see a heathen from the sunny isles away down
in the South Seas, with his face and neck tatooed till he looks
like the customary mendicant from Washoe who has been blown up in
a mine. Some are tattooed a dead blue color down to the upper
lip&mdash;masked, as it were&mdash;leaving the natural light yellow skin
of Micronesia unstained from thence down; some with broad marks
drawn down from hair to neck, on both sides of the face, and a
strip of the original yellow skin, two inches wide, down the
center&mdash;a gridiron with a spoke broken out; and some with the
entire face discolored with the popular mortification tint,
relieved only by one or two thin, wavy threads of natural yellow
running across the face from ear to ear, and eyes twinkling out
of this darkness, from under shadowing hat-brims, like stars in
the dark of the moon.</p>

<p>Moving among the stirring crowds, you come to the poi
merchants, squatting in the shade on their hams, in true native
fashion, and surrounded by purchasers. (The Sandwich Islanders
always squat on their hams, and who knows but they may be the old
original "ham sandwiches?" The thought is pregnant with
interest.) The poi looks like common flour paste, and is kept in
large bowls formed of a species of gourd, and capable of holding
from one to three or four gallons. Poi is the chief article of
food among the natives, and is prepared from the taro plant.</p>

<a name="475"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="475.jpg (33K)" src="images/475.jpg" height="399" width="279">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The taro root looks like a thick, or, if you please, a
corpulent sweet potato, in shape, but is of a light purple color
when boiled. When boiled it answers as a passable substitute for
bread. The buck Kanakas bake it under ground, then mash it up
well with a heavy lava pestle, mix water with it until it becomes
a paste, set it aside and let if ferment, and then it is poi&mdash;and
an unseductive mixture it is, almost tasteless before it ferments
and too sour for a luxury afterward. But nothing is more
nutritious. When solely used, however, it produces acrid humors,
a fact which sufficiently accounts for the humorous character of
the Kanakas. I think there must be as much of a knack in handling
poi as there is in eating with chopsticks. The forefinger is
thrust into the mess and stirred quickly round several times and
drawn as quickly out, thickly coated, just as it it were
poulticed; the head is thrown back, the finger inserted in the
mouth and the delicacy stripped off and swallowed&mdash;the eye
closing gently, meanwhile, in a languid sort of ecstasy. Many a
different finger goes into the same bowl and many a different
kind of dirt and shade and quality of flavor is added to the
virtues of its contents.</p>

<p>Around a small shanty was collected a crowd of natives buying
the awa root. It is said that but for the use of this root the
destruction of the people in former times by certain imported
diseases would have been far greater than it was, and by others
it is said that this is merely a fancy. All agree that poi will
rejuvenate a man who is used up and his vitality almost
annihilated by hard drinking, and that in some kinds of diseases
it will restore health after all medicines have failed; but all
are not willing to allow to the awa the virtues claimed for it.
The natives manufacture an intoxicating drink from it which is
fearful in its effects when persistently indulged in. It covers
the body with dry, white scales, inflames the eyes, and causes
premature decripitude. Although the man before whose
establishment we stopped has to pay a Government license of eight
hundred dollars a year for the exclusive right to sell awa root,
it is said that he makes a small fortune every twelve-month;
while saloon keepers, who pay a thousand dollars a year for the
privilege of retailing whiskey, etc., only make a bare
living.</p>

<p>We found the fish market crowded; for the native is very fond
of fish, and eats the article raw and alive! Let us change the
subject.</p>

<p>In old times here Saturday was a grand gala day indeed. All
the native population of the town forsook their labors, and those
of the surrounding country journeyed to the city. Then the white
folks had to stay indoors, for every street was so packed with
charging cavaliers and cavalieresses that it was next to
impossible to thread one's way through the cavalcades without
getting crippled.</p>

<p>At night they feasted and the girls danced the lascivious hula
hula&mdash;a dance that is said to exhibit the very perfection of
educated notion of limb and arm, hand, head and body, and the
exactest uniformity of movement and accuracy of "time." It was
performed by a circle of girls with no raiment on them to speak
of, who went through an infinite variety of motions and figures
without prompting, and yet so true was their "time," and in such
perfect concert did they move that when they were placed in a
straight line, hands, arms, bodies, limbs and heads waved,
swayed, gesticulated, bowed, stooped, whirled, squirmed, twisted
and undulated as if they were part and parcel of a single
individual; and it was difficult to believe they were not moved
in a body by some exquisite piece of mechanism.</p>

<p>Of late years, however, Saturday has lost most of its quondam
gala features. This weekly stampede of the natives interfered too
much with labor and the interests of the white folks, and by
sticking in a law here, and preaching a sermon there, and by
various other means, they gradually broke it up. The demoralizing
hula hula was forbidden to be performed, save at night, with
closed doors, in presence of few spectators, and only by
permission duly procured from the authorities and the payment of
ten dollars for the same. There are few girls now-a-days able to
dance this ancient national dance in the highest perfection of
the art.</p>

<p>The missionaries have christianized and educated all the
natives. They all belong to the Church, and there is not one of
them, above the age of eight years, but can read and write with
facility in the native tongue. It is the most universally
educated race of people outside of China. They have any quantity
of books, printed in the Kanaka language, and all the natives are
fond of reading. They are inveterate church-goers&mdash;nothing can
keep them away. All this ameliorating cultivation has at last
built up in the native women a profound respect for chastity&mdash;in
other people. Perhaps that is enough to say on that head. The
national sin will die out when the race does, but perhaps not
earlier.&mdash;But doubtless this purifying is not far off, when we
reflect that contact with civilization and the whites has reduced
the native population from four hundred thousand (Captain Cook's
estimate,) to fifty-five thousand in something over eighty
years!</p>

<p>Society is a queer medley in this notable missionary, whaling
and governmental centre. If you get into conversation with a
stranger and experience that natural desire to know what sort of
ground you are treading on by finding out what manner of man your
stranger is, strike out boldly and address him as "Captain."
Watch him narrowly, and if you see by his countenance that you
are on the wrong tack, ask him where he preaches. It is a safe
bet that he is either a missionary or captain of a whaler. I am
now personally acquainted with seventy-two captains and
ninety-six missionaries. The captains and ministers form one-half
of the population; the third fourth is composed of common Kanakas
and mercantile foreigners and their families, and the final
fourth is made up of high officers of the Hawaiian Government.
And there are just about cats enough for three apiece all
around.</p>

<p>A solemn stranger met me in the suburbs the other day, and
said:</p>

<p>"Good morning, your reverence. Preach in the stone church
yonder, no doubt?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I'm not a preacher."</p>

<p>"Really, I beg your pardon, Captain. I trust you had a good
season. How much oil"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oil? What do you take me for? I'm not a whaler."</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg a thousand pardons, your Excellency.</p>

<p>"Major General in the household troops, no doubt? Minister of
the Interior, likely? Secretary of war? First Gentleman of the
Bed-chamber? Commissioner of the Royal"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Stuff! I'm no official. I'm not connected in any way with the
Government."</p>

<p>"Bless my life! Then, who the mischief are you? what the
mischief are you? and how the mischief did you get here, and
where in thunder did you come from?"</p>

<p>"I'm only a private personage&mdash;an unassuming stranger&mdash;lately
arrived from America."</p>

<p>"No? Not a missionary! Not a whaler! not a member of his
Majesty's Government! not even Secretary of the Navy! Ah, Heaven!
it is too blissful to be true; alas, I do but dream. And yet that
noble, honest countenance&mdash;those oblique, ingenuous eyes&mdash;that
massive head, incapable of&mdash;of&mdash;anything; your hand; give me your
hand, bright waif. Excuse these tears. For sixteen weary years I
have yearned for a moment like this, and"&mdash;</p>

<p>Here his feelings were too much for him, and he swooned away.
I pitied this poor creature from the bottom of my heart. I was
deeply moved. I shed a few tears on him and kissed him for his
mother. I then took what small change he had and "shoved".</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVII.</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>I still quote from my journal:</p>

<p>I found the national Legislature to consist of half a dozen
white men and some thirty or forty natives. It was a dark
assemblage. The nobles and Ministers (about a dozen of them
altogether) occupied the extreme left of the hall, with David
Kalakaua (the King's Chamberlain) and Prince William at the head.
The President of the Assembly, His Royal Highness M. Kekuanaoa,
[Kekuanaoa is not of the blood royal. He derives his princely
rank from his wife, who was a daughter of Kamehameha the Great.
Under other monarchies the male line takes precedence of the
female in tracing genealogies, but here the opposite is the
case&mdash;the female line takes precedence. Their reason for this is
exceedingly sensible, and I recommend it to the aristocracy of
Europe: They say it is easy to know who a man's mother was, but,
etc., etc.] and the Vice President (the latter a white man,) sat
in the pulpit, if I may so term it. The President is the King's
father. He is an erect, strongly built, massive featured,
white-haired, tawny old gentleman of eighty years of age or
thereabouts. He was simply but well dressed, in a blue cloth coat
and white vest, and white pantaloons, without spot, dust or
blemish upon them. He bears himself with a calm, stately dignity,
and is a man of noble presence. He was a young man and a
distinguished warrior under that terrific fighter, Kamehameha I.,
more than half a century ago. A knowledge of his career suggested
some such thought as this: "This man, naked as the day he was
born, and war-club and spear in hand, has charged at the head of
a horde of savages against other hordes of savages more than a
generation and a half ago, and reveled in slaughter and carnage;
has worshipped wooden images on his devout knees; has seen
hundreds of his race offered up in heathen temples as sacrifices
to wooden idols, at a time when no missionary's foot had ever
pressed this soil, and he had never heard of the white man's God;
has believed his enemy could secretly pray him to death; has seen
the day, in his childhood, when it was a crime punishable by
death for a man to eat with his wife, or for a plebeian to let
his shadow fall upon the King&mdash;and now look at him; an educated
Christian; neatly and handsomely dressed; a high-minded, elegant
gentleman; a traveler, in some degree, and one who has been the
honored guest of royalty in Europe; a man practiced in holding
the reins of an enlightened government, and well versed in the
politics of his country and in general, practical information.
Look at him, sitting there presiding over the deliberations of a
legislative body, among whom are white men&mdash;a grave, dignified,
statesmanlike personage, and as seemingly natural and fitted to
the place as if he had been born in it and had never been out of
it in his life time. How the experiences of this old man's
eventful life shame the cheap inventions of romance!"</p>

<p>The christianizing of the natives has hardly even weakened
some of their barbarian superstitions, much less destroyed them.
I have just referred to one of these. It is still a popular
belief that if your enemy can get hold of any article belonging
to you he can get down on his knees over it and pray you to
death. Therefore many a native gives up and dies merely because
he imagines that some enemy is putting him through a course of
damaging prayer. This praying an individual to death seems absurd
enough at a first glance, but then when we call to mind some of
the pulpit efforts of certain of our own ministers the thing
looks plausible.</p>

<br><br>

<p>In former times, among the Islanders, not only a plurality of
wives was customary, but a plurality of husbands likewise. Some
native women of noble rank had as many as six husbands. A woman
thus supplied did not reside with all her husbands at once, but
lived several months with each in turn. An understood sign hung
at her door during these months. When the sign was taken down, it
meant "NEXT."</p>

<p>In those days woman was rigidly taught to "know her place."
Her place was to do all the work, take all the cuffs, provide all
the food, and content herself with what was left after her lord
had finished his dinner. She was not only forbidden, by ancient
law, and under penalty of death, to eat with her husband or enter
a canoe, but was debarred, under the same penalty, from eating
bananas, pine-apples, oranges and other choice fruits at any time
or in any place. She had to confine herself pretty strictly to
"poi" and hard work. These poor ignorant heathen seem to have had
a sort of groping idea of what came of woman eating fruit in the
garden of Eden, and they did not choose to take any more chances.
But the missionaries broke up this satisfactory arrangement of
things. They liberated woman and made her the equal of man.</p>

<p>The natives had a romantic fashion of burying some of their
children alive when the family became larger than necessary. The
missionaries interfered in this matter too, and stopped it.</p>

<p>To this day the natives are able to lie down and die whenever
they want to, whether there is anything the matter with them or
not. If a Kanaka takes a notion to die, that is the end of him;
nobody can persuade him to hold on; all the doctors in the world
could not save him.</p>

<p>A luxury which they enjoy more than anything else, is a large
funeral. If a person wants to get rid of a troublesome native, it
is only necessary to promise him a fine funeral and name the hour
and he will be on hand to the minute&mdash;at least his remains
will.</p>

<p>All the natives are Christians, now, but many of them still
desert to the Great Shark God for temporary succor in time of
trouble. An irruption of the great volcano of Kilauea, or an
earthquake, always brings a deal of latent loyalty to the Great
Shark God to the surface. It is common report that the King,
educated, cultivated and refined Christian gentleman as he
undoubtedly is, still turns to the idols of his fathers for help
when disaster threatens. A planter caught a shark, and one of his
christianized natives testified his emancipation from the thrall
of ancient superstition by assisting to dissect the shark after a
fashion forbidden by his abandoned creed. But remorse shortly
began to torture him. He grew moody and sought solitude; brooded
over his sin, refused food, and finally said he must die and
ought to die, for he had sinned against the Great Shark God and
could never know peace any more. He was proof against persuasion
and ridicule, and in the course of a day or two took to his bed
and died, although he showed no symptom of disease. His young
daughter followed his lead and suffered a like fate within the
week. Superstition is ingrained in the native blood and bone and
it is only natural that it should crop out in time of distress.
Wherever one goes in the Islands, he will find small piles of
stones by the wayside, covered with leafy offerings, placed there
by the natives to appease evil spirits or honor local deities
belonging to the mythology of former days.</p>

<p>In the rural districts of any of the Islands, the traveler
hourly comes upon parties of dusky maidens bathing in the streams
or in the sea without any clothing on and exhibiting no very
intemperate zeal in the matter of hiding their nakedness. When
the missionaries first took up their residence in Honolulu, the
native women would pay their families frequent friendly visits,
day by day, not even clothed with a blush. It was found a hard
matter to convince them that this was rather indelicate. Finally
the missionaries provided them with long, loose calico robes, and
that ended the difficulty&mdash;for the women would troop through the
town, stark naked, with their robes folded under their arms,
march to the missionary houses and then proceed to dress!&mdash;

<br><br>

<p>The
natives soon manifested a strong proclivity for clothing, but it
was shortly apparent that they only wanted it for grandeur. The
missionaries imported a quantity of hats, bonnets, and other male
and female wearing apparel, instituted a general distribution,
and begged the people not to come to church naked, next Sunday,
as usual. And they did not; but the national spirit of
unselfishness led them to divide up with neighbors who were not
at the distribution, and next Sabbath the poor preachers could
hardly keep countenance before their vast congregations. In the
midst of the reading of a hymn a brown, stately dame would sweep
up the aisle with a world of airs, with nothing in the world on
but a "stovepipe" hat and a pair of cheap gloves; another dame
would follow, tricked out in a man's shirt, and nothing else;
another one would enter with a flourish, with simply the sleeves
of a bright calico dress tied around her waist and the rest of
the garment dragging behind like a peacock's tail off duty; a
stately "buck" Kanaka would stalk in with a woman's bonnet on,
wrong side before&mdash;only this, and nothing more; after him would
stride his fellow, with the legs of a pair of pantaloons tied
around his neck, the rest of his person untrammeled; in his rear
would come another gentleman simply gotten up in a fiery neck-tie
and a striped vest.</p>

<img alt="485.jpg (90K)" src="images/485.jpg" height="475" width="567">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The poor creatures were beaming with complacency and wholly
unconscious of any absurdity in their appearance. They gazed at
each other with happy admiration, and it was plain to see that
the young girls were taking note of what each other had on, as
naturally as if they had always lived in a land of Bibles and
knew what churches were made for; here was the evidence of a
dawning civilization. The spectacle which the congregation
presented was so extraordinary and withal so moving, that the
missionaries found it difficult to keep to the text and go on
with the services; and by and by when the simple children of the
sun began a general swapping of garments in open meeting and
produced some irresistibly grotesque effects in the course of
re-dressing, there was nothing for it but to cut the thing short
with the benediction and dismiss the fantastic assemblage.</p>

<p>In our country, children play "keep house;" and in the same
high-sounding but miniature way the grown folk here, with the
poor little material of slender territory and meagre population,
play "empire." There is his royal Majesty the King, with a New
York detective's income of thirty or thirty-five thousand dollars
a year from the "royal civil list" and the "royal domain." He
lives in a two-story frame "palace."</p>

<a name="486"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="486.jpg (35K)" src="images/486.jpg" height="335" width="329">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>And there is the "royal family"&mdash;the customary hive of royal
brothers, sisters, cousins and other noble drones and vagrants
usual to monarchy,&mdash;all with a spoon in the national pap-dish,
and all bearing such titles as his or her Royal Highness the
Prince or Princess So-and-so. Few of them can carry their royal
splendors far enough to ride in carriages, however; they sport
the economical Kanaka horse or "hoof it" with the plebeians.</p>

<p>Then there is his Excellency the "royal Chamberlain"&mdash;a
sinecure, for his majesty dresses himself with his own hands,
except when he is ruralizing at Waikiki and then he requires no
dressing.</p>

<p>Next we have his Excellency the Commander-in-chief of the
Household Troops, whose forces consist of about the number of
soldiers usually placed under a corporal in other lands.</p>

<p>Next comes the royal Steward and the Grand Equerry in
Waiting&mdash;high dignitaries with modest salaries and little to
do.</p>

<p>Then we have his Excellency the First Gentleman of the
Bed-chamber&mdash;an office as easy as it is magnificent.</p>

<p>Next we come to his Excellency the Prime Minister, a renegade
American from New Hampshire, all jaw, vanity, bombast and
ignorance, a lawyer of "shyster" calibre, a fraud by nature, a
humble worshipper of the sceptre above him, a reptile never tired
of sneering at the land of his birth or glorifying the ten-acre
kingdom that has adopted him&mdash;salary, $4,000 a year, vast
consequence, and no perquisites.</p>

<p>Then we have his Excellency the Imperial Minister of Finance,
who handles a million dollars of public money a year, sends in
his annual "budget" with great ceremony, talks prodigiously of
"finance," suggests imposing schemes for paying off the "national
debt" (of $150,000,) and does it all for $4,000 a year and
unimaginable glory.</p>

<p>Next we have his Excellency the Minister of War, who holds
sway over the royal armies&mdash;they consist of two hundred and
thirty uniformed Kanakas, mostly Brigadier Generals, and if the
country ever gets into trouble with a foreign power we shall
probably hear from them. I knew an American whose copper-plate
visiting card bore this impressive legend: "Lieutenant-Colonel in
the Royal Infantry." To say that he was proud of this distinction
is stating it but tamely. The Minister of War has also in his
charge some venerable swivels on Punch-Bowl Hill wherewith royal
salutes are fired when foreign vessels of war enter the port.</p>

<p>Next comes his Excellency the Minister of the Navy&mdash;a nabob
who rules the "royal fleet," (a steam-tug and a sixty-ton
schooner.)</p>

<p>And next comes his Grace the Lord Bishop of Honolulu, the
chief dignitary of the "Established Church"&mdash;for when the
American Presbyterian missionaries had completed the reduction of
the nation to a compact condition of Christianity, native royalty
stepped in and erected the grand dignity of an "Established
(Episcopal) Church" over it, and imported a cheap ready-made
Bishop from England to take charge. The chagrin of the
missionaries has never been comprehensively expressed, to this
day, profanity not being admissible.</p>

<p>Next comes his Excellency the Minister of Public
Instruction.</p>

<p>Next, their Excellencies the Governors of Oahu, Hawaii, etc.,
and after them a string of High Sheriffs and other small fry too
numerous for computation.</p>

<p>Then there are their Excellencies the Envoy Extraordinary and
Minister Plenipotentiary of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor of
the French; her British Majesty's Minister; the Minister
Resident, of the United States; and some six or eight
representatives of other foreign nations, all with sounding
titles, imposing dignity and prodigious but economical state.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Imagine all this grandeur in a play-house "kingdom" whose
population falls absolutely short of sixty thousand souls!</p>

<p>The people are so accustomed to nine-jointed titles and
colossal magnates that a foreign prince makes very little more
stir in Honolulu than a Western Congressman does in New York.</p>

<p>And let it be borne in mind that there is a strictly defined
"court costume" of so "stunning" a nature that it would make the
clown in a circus look tame and commonplace by comparison; and
each Hawaiian official dignitary has a gorgeous vari-colored,
gold-laced uniform peculiar to his office&mdash;no two of them are
alike, and it is hard to tell which one is the "loudest." The
King had a "drawing-room" at stated intervals, like other
monarchs, and when these varied uniforms congregate
there&mdash;weak-eyed people have to contemplate the spectacle through
smoked glass. Is there not a gratifying contrast between this
latter-day exhibition and the one the ancestors of some of these
magnates afforded the missionaries the Sunday after the old-time
distribution of clothing? Behold what religion and civilization
have wrought!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXVIII.</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>While I was in Honolulu I witnessed the ceremonious funeral of
the King's sister, her Royal Highness the Princess Victoria.
According to the royal custom, the remains had lain in state at
the palace thirty days, watched day and night by a guard of
honor. And during all that time a great multitude of natives from
the several islands had kept the palace grounds well crowded and
had made the place a pandemonium every night with their howlings
and wailings, beating of tom-toms and dancing of the (at other
times) forbidden "hula-hula" by half-clad maidens to the music of
songs of questionable decency chanted in honor of the deceased.
The printed programme of the funeral procession interested me at
the time; and after what I have just said of Hawaiian
grandiloquence in the matter of "playing empire," I am persuaded
that a perusal of it may interest the reader:</p>

<p>After reading the long list of dignitaries, etc., and
remembering the sparseness of the population, one is almost
inclined to wonder where the material for that portion of the
procession devoted to "Hawaiian Population Generally" is going to
be procured:</p>

<p>I resume my journal at the point where the procession arrived
at the royal mausoleum:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>As the procession filed through the gate, the military
deployed handsomely to the right and left and formed an avenue
through which the long column of mourners passed to the tomb. The
coffin was borne through the door of the mausoleum, followed by
the King and his chiefs, the great officers of the kingdom,
foreign Consuls, Embassadors and distinguished guests (Burlingame
and General Van Valkenburgh). Several of the kahilis were then
fastened to a frame- work in front of the tomb, there to remain
until they decay and fall to pieces, or, forestalling this, until
another scion of royalty dies. At this point of the proceedings
the multitude set up such a heart-broken wailing as I hope never
to hear again.</p>

<a name="492"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="492.jpg (90K)" src="images/492.jpg" height="467" width="597">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The soldiers fired three volleys of musketry&mdash;the wailing
being previously silenced to permit of the guns being heard. His
Highness Prince William, in a showy military uniform (the "true
prince," this&mdash;scion of the house over-thrown by the present
dynasty&mdash;he was formerly betrothed to the Princess but was not
allowed to marry her), stood guard and paced back and forth
within the door. The privileged few who followed the coffin into
the mausoleum remained sometime, but the King soon came out and
stood in the door and near one side of it. A stranger could have
guessed his rank (although he was so simply and unpretentiously
dressed) by the profound deference paid him by all persons in his
vicinity; by seeing his high officers receive his quiet orders
and suggestions with bowed and uncovered heads; and by observing
how careful those persons who came out of the mausoleum were to
avoid "crowding" him (although there was room enough in the
doorway for a wagon to pass, for that matter); how respectfully
they edged out sideways, scraping their backs against the wall
and always presenting a front view of their persons to his
Majesty, and never putting their hats on until they were well out
of the royal presence.</p>

<p>He was dressed entirely in black&mdash;dress-coat and silk hat&mdash;and
looked rather democratic in the midst of the showy uniforms about
him. On his breast he wore a large gold star, which was half
hidden by the lapel of his coat. He remained at the door a half
hour, and occasionally gave an order to the men who were erecting
the kahilis [Ranks of long-handled mops made of gaudy
feathers&mdash;sacred to royalty. They are stuck in the ground around
the tomb and left there.] before the tomb. He had the good taste
to make one of them substitute black crape for the ordinary
hempen rope he was about to tie one of them to the frame-work
with. Finally he entered his carriage and drove away, and the
populace shortly began to drop into his wake. While he was in
view there was but one man who attracted more attention than
himself, and that was Harris (the Yankee Prime Minister). This
feeble personage had crape enough around his hat to express the
grief of an entire nation, and as usual he neglected no
opportunity of making himself conspicuous and exciting the
admiration of the simple Kanakas. Oh! noble ambition of this
modern Richelieu!</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>It is interesting to contrast the funeral ceremonies of the
Princess Victoria with those of her noted ancestor Kamehameha the
Conqueror, who died fifty years ago&mdash;in 1819, the year before the
first missionaries came.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"On the 8th of May, 1819, at the age of sixty-six, he died, as
he had lived, in the faith of his country. It was his misfortune
not to have come in contact with men who could have rightly
influenced his religious aspirations. Judged by his advantages
and compared with the most eminent of his countrymen he may be
justly styled not only great, but good. To this day his memory
warms the heart and elevates the national feelings of Hawaiians.
They are proud of their old warrior King; they love his name; his
deeds form their historical age; and an enthusiasm everywhere
prevails, shared even by foreigners who knew his worth, that
constitutes the firmest pillar of the throne of his dynasty.</p>

<p>"In lieu of human victims (the custom of that age), a
sacrifice of three hundred dogs attended his obsequies&mdash;no mean
holocaust when their national value and the estimation in which
they were held are considered. The bones of Kamehameha, after
being kept for a while, were so carefully concealed that all
knowledge of their final resting place is now lost. There was a
proverb current among the common people that the bones of a cruel
King could not be hid; they made fish-hooks and arrows of them,
upon which, in using them, they vented their abhorrence of his
memory in bitter execrations."</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>The account of the circumstances of his death, as written by
the native historians, is full of minute detail, but there is
scarcely a line of it which does not mention or illustrate some
by-gone custom of the country. In this respect it is the most
comprehensive document I have yet met with. I will quote it
entire:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"When Kamehameha was dangerously sick, and the priests were
unable to cure him, they said: 'Be of good courage and build a
house for the god' (his own private god or idol), that thou
mayest recover.' The chiefs corroborated this advice of the
priests, and a place of worship was prepared for Kukailimoku, and
consecrated in the evening. They proposed also to the King, with
a view to prolong his life, that human victims should be
sacrificed to his deity; upon which the greater part of the
people absconded through fear of death, and concealed themselves
in hiding places till the tabu [Tabu (pronounced tah-boo,) means
prohibition (we have borrowed it,) or sacred. The tabu was
sometimes permanent, sometimes temporary; and the person or thing
placed under tabu was for the time being sacred to the purpose
for which it was set apart. In the above case the victims
selected under the tabu would be sacred to the sacrifice] in
which destruction impended, was past. It is doubtful whether
Kamehameha approved of the plan of the chiefs and priests to
sacrifice men, as he was known to say, 'The men are sacred for
the King;' meaning that they were for the service of his
successor. This information was derived from Liholiho, his
son.</p>

<p>"After this, his sickness increased to such a degree that he
had not strength to turn himself in his bed. When another season,
consecrated for worship at the new temple (heiau) arrived, he
said to his son, Liholiho, 'Go thou and make supplication to thy
god; I am not able to go, and will offer my prayers at home.'
When his devotions to his feathered god, Kukailimoku, were
concluded, a certain religiously disposed individual, who had a
bird god, suggested to the King that through its influence his
sickness might be removed. The name of this god was Pua; its body
was made of a bird, now eaten by the Hawaiians, and called in
their language alae. Kamehameha was willing that a trial should
be made, and two houses were constructed to facilitate the
experiment; but while dwelling in them he became so very weak as
not to receive food. After lying there three days, his wives,
children and chiefs, perceiving that he was very low, returned
him to his own house. In the evening he was carried to the eating
house, where he took a little food in his mouth which he did not
swallow; also a cup of water. The chiefs requested him to give
them his counsel; but he made no reply, and was carried back to
the dwelling house; but when near midnight&mdash;ten o'clock,
perhaps&mdash;he was carried again to the place to eat; but, as
before, he merely tasted of what was presented to him. Then
Kaikioewa addressed him thus: 'Here we all are, your younger
brethren, your son Liholiho and your foreigner; impart to us your
dying charge, that Liholiho and Kaahumanu may hear.' Then
Kamehameha inquired, 'What do you say?' Kaikioewa repeated, 'Your
counsels for us.'</p>

<p>"He then said, 'Move on in my good way and&mdash;.' He could
proceed no further. The foreigner, Mr. Young, embraced and kissed
him. Hoapili also embraced him, whispering something in his ear,
after which he was taken back to the house. About twelve he was
carried once more to the house for eating, into which his head
entered, while his body was in the dwelling house immediately
adjoining. It should be remarked that this frequent carrying of a
sick chief from one house to another resulted from the tabu
system, then in force. There were at that time six houses (huts)
connected with an establishment&mdash;one was for worship, one for the
men to eat in, an eating house for the women, a house to sleep
in, a house in which to manufacture kapa (native cloth) and one
where, at certain intervals, the women might dwell in
seclusion.</p>

<p>"The sick was once more taken to his house, when he expired;
this was at two o'clock, a circumstance from which Leleiohoku
derived his name. As he breathed his last, Kalaimoku came to the
eating house to order those in it to go out. There were two aged
persons thus directed to depart; one went, the other remained on
account of love to the King, by whom he had formerly been kindly
sustained. The children also were sent away. Then Kalaimoku came
to the house, and the chiefs had a consultation. One of them
spoke thus: 'This is my thought&mdash;we will eat him raw. [This
sounds suspicious, in view of the fact that all Sandwich Island
historians, white and black, protest that cannibalism never
existed in the islands. However, since they only proposed to "eat
him raw" we "won't count that". But it would certainly have been
cannibalism if they had cooked him.&mdash;M. T.] Kaahumanu (one of the
dead King's widows) replied, 'Perhaps his body is not at our
disposal; that is more properly with his successor. Our part in
him&mdash;his breath&mdash;has departed; his remains will be disposed of by
Liholiho.'</p>

<p>"After this conversation the body was taken into the
consecrated house for the performance of the proper rites by the
priest and the new King. The name of this ceremony is uko; and
when the sacred hog was baked the priest offered it to the dead
body, and it became a god, the King at the same time repeating
the customary prayers.</p>

<p>"Then the priest, addressing himself to the King and chiefs,
said: 'I will now make known to you the rules to be observed
respecting persons to be sacrificed on the burial of this body.
If you obtain one man before the corpse is removed, one will be
sufficient; but after it leaves this house four will be required.
If delayed until we carry the corpse to the grave there must be
ten; but after it is deposited in the grave there must be
fifteen. To-morrow morning there will be a tabu, and, if the
sacrifice be delayed until that time, forty men must die.'</p>

<p>"Then the high priest, Hewahewa, inquired of the chiefs,
'Where shall be the residence of King Liholiho?' They replied,
'Where, indeed? You, of all men, ought to know.' Then the priest
observed, 'There are two suitable places; one is Kau, the other
is Kohala.' The chiefs preferred the latter, as it was more
thickly inhabited. The priest added, 'These are proper places for
the King's residence; but he must not remain in Kona, for it is
polluted.' This was agreed to. It was now break of day. As he was
being carried to the place of burial the people perceived that
their King was dead, and they wailed. When the corpse was removed
from the house to the tomb, a distance of one chain, the
procession was met by a certain man who was ardently attached to
the deceased. He leaped upon the chiefs who were carrying the
King's body; he desired to die with him on account of his love.
The chiefs drove him away. He persisted in making numerous
attempts, which were unavailing. Kalaimoka also had it in his
heart to die with him, but was prevented by Hookio.</p>

<p>"The morning following Kamehameha's death, Liholiho and his
train departed for Kohala, according to the suggestions of the
priest, to avoid the defilement occasioned by the dead. At this
time if a chief died the land was polluted, and the heirs sought
a residence in another part of the country until the corpse was
dissected and the bones tied in a bundle, which being done, the
season of defilement terminated. If the deceased were not a
chief, the house only was defiled which became pure again on the
burial of the body. Such were the laws on this subject.</p>

<p>"On the morning on which Liholiho sailed in his canoe for
Kohala, the chiefs and people mourned after their manner on
occasion of a chief's death, conducting themselves like madmen
and like beasts. Their conduct was such as to forbid description;
The priests, also, put into action the sorcery apparatus, that
the person who had prayed the King to death might die; for it was
not believed that Kamehameha's departure was the effect either of
sickness or old age. When the sorcerers set up by their
fire-places sticks with a strip of kapa flying at the top, the
chief Keeaumoku, Kaahumaun's brother, came in a state of
intoxication and broke the flag-staff of the sorcerers, from
which it was inferred that Kaahumanu and her friends had been
instrumental in the King's death. On this account they were
subjected to abuse."</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>You have the contrast, now, and a strange one it is. This
great Queen, Kaahumanu, who was "subjected to abuse" during the
frightful orgies that followed the King's death, in accordance
with ancient custom, afterward became a devout Christian and a
steadfast and powerful friend of the missionaries.</p>

<p>Dogs were, and still are, reared and fattened for food, by the
natives&mdash;hence the reference to their value in one of the above
paragraphs.</p>

<p>Forty years ago it was the custom in the Islands to suspend
all law for a certain number of days after the death of a royal
personage; and then a saturnalia ensued which one may picture to
himself after a fashion, but not in the full horror of the
reality. The people shaved their heads, knocked out a tooth or
two, plucked out an eye sometimes, cut, bruised, mutilated or
burned their flesh, got drunk, burned each other's huts, maimed
or murdered one another according to the caprice of the moment,
and both sexes gave themselves up to brutal and unbridled
licentiousness.</p>

<br><br>

<p>And after it all, came a torpor from which the nation slowly
emerged bewildered and dazed, as if from a hideous
half-remembered nightmare. They were not the salt of the earth,
those "gentle children of the sun."</p>

<p>The natives still keep up an old custom of theirs which cannot
be comforting to an invalid. When they think a sick friend is
going to die, a couple of dozen neighbors surround his hut and
keep up a deafening wailing night and day till he either dies or
gets well. No doubt this arrangement has helped many a subject to
a shroud before his appointed time.</p>

<p>They surround a hut and wail in the same heart-broken way when
its occupant returns from a journey. This is their dismal idea of
a welcome. A very little of it would go a great way with most of
us.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXIX.</h2>
</center>
<br>



<p>Bound for Hawaii (a hundred and fifty miles distant,) to visit
the great volcano and behold the other notable things which
distinguish that island above the remainder of the group, we
sailed from Honolulu on a certain Saturday afternoon, in the good
schooner Boomerang.</p>

<p>The Boomerang was about as long as two street cars, and about
as wide as one. She was so small (though she was larger than the
majority of the inter-island coasters) that when I stood on her
deck I felt but little smaller than the Colossus of Rhodes must
have felt when he had a man-of- war under him. I could reach the
water when she lay over under a strong breeze. When the Captain
and my comrade (a Mr. Billings), myself and four other persons
were all assembled on the little after portion of the deck which
is sacred to the cabin passengers, it was full&mdash;there was not
room for any more quality folks. Another section of the deck,
twice as large as ours, was full of natives of both sexes, with
their customary dogs, mats, blankets, pipes, calabashes of poi,
fleas, and other luxuries and baggage of minor importance. As
soon as we set sail the natives all lay down on the deck as thick
as negroes in a slave-pen, and smoked, conversed, and spit on
each other, and were truly sociable.</p>

<p>The little low-ceiled cabin below was rather larger than a
hearse, and as dark as a vault. It had two coffins on each
side&mdash;I mean two bunks. A small table, capable of accommodating
three persons at dinner, stood against the forward bulkhead, and
over it hung the dingiest whale oil lantern that ever peopled the
obscurity of a dungeon with ghostly shapes. The floor room
unoccupied was not extensive. One might swing a cat in it,
perhaps, but not a long cat. The hold forward of the bulkhead had
but little freight in it, and from morning till night a portly
old rooster, with a voice like Baalam's ass, and the same
disposition to use it, strutted up and down in that part of the
vessel and crowed. He usually took dinner at six o'clock, and
then, after an hour devoted to meditation, he mounted a barrel
and crowed a good part of the night. He got hoarser all the time,
but he scorned to allow any personal consideration to interfere
with his duty, and kept up his labors in defiance of threatened
diphtheria.</p>

<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="499.jpg (19K)" src="images/499.jpg" height="308" width="235">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Sleeping was out of the question when he was on watch. He was
a source of genuine aggravation and annoyance. It was worse than
useless to shout at him or apply offensive epithets to him&mdash;he
only took these things for applause, and strained himself to make
more noise. Occasionally, during the day, I threw potatoes at him
through an aperture in the bulkhead, but he only dodged and went
on crowing.</p>

<p>The first night, as I lay in my coffin, idly watching the dim
lamp swinging to the rolling of the ship, and snuffing the
nauseous odors of bilge water, I felt something gallop over me. I
turned out promptly. However, I turned in again when I found it
was only a rat. Presently something galloped over me once more. I
knew it was not a rat this time, and I thought it might be a
centipede, because the Captain had killed one on deck in the
afternoon. I turned out. The first glance at the pillow showed me
repulsive sentinel perched upon each end of it&mdash;cockroaches as
large as peach leaves&mdash;fellows with long, quivering antennae and
fiery, malignant eyes. They were grating their teeth like tobacco
worms, and appeared to be dissatisfied about something. I had
often heard that these reptiles were in the habit of eating off
sleeping sailors' toe nails down to the quick, and I would not
get in the bunk any more. I lay down on the floor. But a rat came
and bothered me, and shortly afterward a procession of
cockroaches arrived and camped in my hair. In a few moments the
rooster was crowing with uncommon spirit and a party of fleas
were throwing double somersaults about my person in the wildest
disorder, and taking a bite every time they struck. I was
beginning to feel really annoyed. I got up and put my clothes on
and went on deck.</p>

<p>The above is not overdrawn; it is a truthful sketch of
inter-island schooner life. There is no such thing as keeping a
vessel in elegant condition, when she carries molasses and
Kanakas.</p>

<p>It was compensation for my sufferings to come unexpectedly
upon so beautiful a scene as met my eye&mdash;to step suddenly out of
the sepulchral gloom of the cabin and stand under the strong
light of the moon&mdash;in the centre, as it were, of a glittering sea
of liquid silver&mdash;to see the broad sails straining in the gale,
the ship heeled over on her side, the angry foam hissing past her
lee bulwarks, and sparkling sheets of spray dashing high over her
bows and raining upon her decks; to brace myself and hang fast to
the first object that presented itself, with hat jammed down and
coat tails whipping in the breeze, and feel that exhilaration
that thrills in one's hair and quivers down his back bone when he
knows that every inch of canvas is drawing and the vessel
cleaving through the waves at her utmost speed. There was no
darkness, no dimness, no obscurity there. All was brightness,
every object was vividly defined. Every prostrate Kanaka; every
coil of rope; every calabash of poi; every puppy; every seam in
the flooring; every bolthead; every object; however minute,
showed sharp and distinct in its every outline; and the shadow of
the broad mainsail lay black as a pall upon the deck, leaving
Billings's white upturned face glorified and his body in a total
eclipse.

<p>
Monday morning we were close to the island of Hawaii.
Two of its high mountains were in view&mdash;Mauna Loa and
Hualaiai. The latter is an imposing peak, but being only ten thousand
feet high is seldom mentioned or heard of. Mauna Loa is said to
be sixteen thousand feet high. The rays of glittering snow and
ice, that clasped its summit like a claw, looked refreshing when
viewed from the blistering climate we were in. One could stand on
that mountain (wrapped up in blankets and furs to keep warm), and
while he nibbled a snowball or an icicle to quench his thirst he
could look down the long sweep of its sides and see spots where
plants are growing that grow only where the bitter cold of Winter
prevails; lower down he could see sections devoted to production
that thrive in the temperate zone alone; and at the bottom of the
mountain he could see the home of the tufted cocoa-palms and
other species of vegetation that grow only in the sultry
atmosphere of eternal Summer. He could see all the climes of the
world at a single glance of the eye, and that glance would only
pass over a distance of four or five miles as the bird flies!</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>By and by we took boat and went ashore at Kailua, designing to
ride horseback through the pleasant orange and coffee region of
Kona, and rejoin the vessel at a point some leagues distant. This
journey is well worth taking. The trail passes along on high
ground&mdash;say a thousand feet above sea level&mdash;and usually about a
mile distant from the ocean, which is always in sight, save that
occasionally you find yourself buried in the forest in the midst
of a rank tropical vegetation and a dense growth of trees, whose
great bows overarch the road and shut out sun and sea and
everything, and leave you in a dim, shady tunnel, haunted with
invisible singing birds and fragrant with the odor of flowers. It
was pleasant to ride occasionally in the warm sun, and feast the
eye upon the ever- changing panorama of the forest (beyond and
below us), with its many tints, its softened lights and shadows,
its billowy undulations sweeping gently down from the mountain to
the sea. It was pleasant also, at intervals, to leave the sultry
sun and pass into the cool, green depths of this forest and
indulge in sentimental reflections under the inspiration of its
brooding twilight and its whispering foliage. We rode through one
orange grove that had ten thousand tree in it! They were all
laden with fruit.</p>

<p>At one farmhouse we got some large peaches of excellent
flavor. This fruit, as a general thing, does not do well in the
Sandwich Islands. It takes a sort of almond shape, and is small
and bitter. It needs frost, they say, and perhaps it does; if
this be so, it will have a good opportunity to go on needing it,
as it will not be likely to get it. The trees from which the fine
fruit I have spoken of, came, had been planted and replanted
sixteen times, and to this treatment the proprietor of the
orchard attributed his-success.</p>

<p>We passed several sugar plantations&mdash;new ones and not very
extensive. The crops were, in most cases, third rattoons.
[NOTE.&mdash;The first crop is called "plant cane;" subsequent crops
which spring from the original roots, without replanting, are
called "rattoons."] Almost everywhere on the island of Hawaii
sugar-cane matures in twelve months, both rattoons and plant, and
although it ought to be taken off as soon as it tassels, no
doubt, it is not absolutely necessary to do it until about four
months afterward. In Kona, the average yield of an acre of ground
is two tons of sugar, they say. This is only a moderate yield for
these islands, but would be astounding for Louisiana and most
other sugar growing countries. The plantations in Kona being on
pretty high ground&mdash;up among the light and frequent rains&mdash;no
irrigation whatever is required.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXX.</h2>
</center>
<br>


<p>We stopped some time at one of the plantations, to rest
ourselves and refresh the horses. We had a chatty conversation
with several gentlemen present; but there was one person, a
middle aged man, with an absent look in his face, who simply
glanced up, gave us good-day and lapsed again into the
meditations which our coming had interrupted. The planters
whispered us not to mind him&mdash;crazy. They said he was in the
Islands for his health; was a preacher; his home, Michigan. They
said that if he woke up presently and fell to talking about a
correspondence which he had some time held with Mr. Greeley about
a trifle of some kind, we must humor him and listen with
interest; and we must humor his fancy that this correspondence
was the talk of the world.</p>

<a name="505"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="505.jpg (46K)" src="images/505.jpg" height="390" width="424">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>It was easy to see that he was a gentle creature and that his
madness had nothing vicious in it. He looked pale, and a little
worn, as if with perplexing thought and anxiety of mind. He sat a
long time, looking at the floor, and at intervals muttering to
himself and nodding his head acquiescingly or shaking it in mild
protest. He was lost in his thought, or in his memories. We
continued our talk with the planters, branching from subject to
subject. But at last the word "circumstance," casually dropped,
in the course of conversation, attracted his attention and
brought an eager look into his countenance. He faced about in his
chair and said:</p>

<p>"Circumstance? What circumstance? Ah, I know&mdash;I know too well.
So you have heard of it too." [With a sigh.] "Well, no
matter&mdash;all the world has heard of it. All the world. The whole
world. It is a large world, too, for a thing to travel so far
in&mdash;now isn't it? Yes, yes&mdash;the Greeley correspondence with
Erickson has created the saddest and bitterest controversy on
both sides of the ocean&mdash;and still they keep it up! It makes us
famous, but at what a sorrowful sacrifice! I was so sorry when I
heard that it had caused that bloody and distressful war over
there in Italy. It was little comfort to me, after so much
bloodshed, to know that the victors sided with me, and the
vanquished with Greeley.&mdash;It is little comfort to know that
Horace Greeley is responsible for the battle of Sadowa, and not
me.</p>

<p>"Queen Victoria wrote me that she felt just as I did about
it&mdash;she said that as much as she was opposed to Greeley and the
spirit he showed in the correspondence with me, she would not
have had Sadowa happen for hundreds of dollars. I can show you
her letter, if you would like to see it. But gentlemen, much as
you may think you know about that unhappy correspondence, you
cannot know the straight of it till you hear it from my lips. It
has always been garbled in the journals, and even in history.
Yes, even in history&mdash;think of it! Let me&mdash;please let me, give
you the matter, exactly as it occurred. I truly will not abuse
your confidence."</p>

<p>Then he leaned forward, all interest, all earnestness, and
told his story&mdash;and told it appealingly, too, and yet in the
simplest and most unpretentious way; indeed, in such a way as to
suggest to one, all the time, that this was a faithful, honorable
witness, giving evidence in the sacred interest of justice, and
under oath. He said:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Beazeley&mdash;Mrs. Jackson Beazeley, widow, of the village
of Campbellton, Kansas,&mdash;wrote me about a matter which was near
her heart&mdash;a matter which many might think trivial, but to her
it was a thing of deep concern. I was living in Michigan,
then&mdash;serving in the ministry. She was, and is, an estimable
woman&mdash;a woman to whom poverty and hardship have proven
incentives to industry, in place of discouragements. Her only
treasure was her son William, a youth just verging upon manhood;
religious, amiable, and sincerely attached to agriculture. He was
the widow's comfort and her pride. And so, moved by her love for
him, she wrote me about a matter, as I have said before, which
lay near her heart&mdash;because it lay near her boy's. She desired
me to confer with Mr. Greeley about turnips. Turnips were the
dream of her child's young ambition. While other youths were
frittering away in frivolous amusements the precious years of
budding vigor which God had given them for useful preparation,
this boy was patiently enriching his mind with information
concerning turnips. The sentiment which he felt toward the turnip
was akin to adoration. He could not think of the turnip without
emotion; he could not speak of it calmly; he could not
contemplate it without exaltation. He could not eat it without
shedding tears. All the poetry in his sensitive nature was in
sympathy with the gracious vegetable. With the earliest pipe of
dawn he sought his patch, and when the curtaining night drove him
from it he shut himself up with his books and garnered statistics
till sleep overcame him. On rainy days he sat and talked hours
together with his mother about turnips. When company came, he
made it his loving duty to put aside everything else and converse
with them all the day long of his great joy in the turnip.</p>

<a name="507"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="507.jpg (67K)" src="images/507.jpg" height="417" width="468">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>"And yet, was this joy rounded and complete? Was there no
secret alloy of unhappiness in it? Alas, there was. There was a
canker gnawing at his heart; the noblest inspiration of his soul
eluded his endeavor&mdash;viz: he could not make of the turnip a
climbing vine. Months went by; the bloom forsook his cheek, the
fire faded out of his eye; sighings and abstraction usurped the
place of smiles and cheerful converse. But a watchful eye noted
these things and in time a motherly sympathy unsealed the secret.
Hence the letter to me. She pleaded for attention&mdash;she said her
boy was dying by inches.</p>

<p>"I was a stranger to Mr. Greeley, but what of that? The matter
was urgent. I wrote and begged him to solve the difficult problem
if possible and save the student's life. My interest grew, until
it partook of the anxiety of the mother. I waited in much
suspense.&mdash;At last the answer came.</p>

<a name="509"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="509.jpg (127K)" src="images/509.jpg" height="1006" width="585">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>"I found that I could not read it readily, the handwriting
being unfamiliar and my emotions somewhat wrought up. It seemed
to refer in part to the boy's case, but chiefly to other and
irrelevant matters&mdash;such as paving-stones, electricity, oysters,
and something which I took to be 'absolution' or 'agrarianism,' I
could not be certain which; still, these appeared to be simply
casual mentions, nothing more; friendly in spirit, without doubt,
but lacking the connection or coherence necessary to make them
useful.&mdash;I judged that my understanding was affected by my
feelings, and so laid the letter away till morning.</p>

<p>"In the morning I read it again, but with difficulty and
uncertainty still, for I had lost some little rest and my mental
vision seemed clouded. The note was more connected, now, but did
not meet the emergency it was expected to meet. It was too
discursive. It appeared to read as follows, though I was not
certain of some of the words:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"Polygamy dissembles majesty; extracts redeem polarity; causes
hitherto exist. Ovations pursue wisdom, or warts inherit and
condemn. Boston, botany, cakes, folony undertakes, but who shall
allay? We fear not. Yrxwly, HEVACE EVEELOJ.'</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>"But there did not seem to be a word about turnips. There
seemed to be no suggestion as to how they might be made to grow
like vines. There was not even a reference to the Beazeleys. I
slept upon the matter; I ate no supper, neither any breakfast
next morning. So I resumed my work with a brain refreshed, and
was very hopeful. Now the letter took a different aspect-all save
the signature, which latter I judged to be only a harmless
affectation of Hebrew. The epistle was necessarily from Mr.
Greeley, for it bore the printed heading of The Tribune, and I
had written to no one else there. The letter, I say, had taken a
different aspect, but still its language was eccentric and
avoided the issue. It now appeared to say:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"Bolivia extemporizes mackerel; borax esteems polygamy;
sausages wither in the east. Creation perdu, is done; for woes
inherent one can damn. Buttons, buttons, corks, geology
underrates but we shall allay. My beer's out. Yrxwly, HEVACE
EVEELOJ.'</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>"I was evidently overworked. My comprehension was impaired.
Therefore I gave two days to recreation, and then returned to my
task greatly refreshed. The letter now took this form:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"Poultices do sometimes choke swine; tulips reduce posterity;
causes leather to resist. Our notions empower wisdom, her let's
afford while we can. Butter but any cakes, fill any undertaker,
we'll wean him from his filly. We feel hot. Yrxwly, HEVACE
EVEELOJ.'</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>"I was still not satisfied. These generalities did not meet
the question. They were crisp, and vigorous, and delivered with a
confidence that almost compelled conviction; but at such a time
as this, with a human life at stake, they seemed inappropriate,
worldly, and in bad taste. At any other time I would have been
not only glad, but proud, to receive from a man like Mr. Greeley
a letter of this kind, and would have studied it earnestly and
tried to improve myself all I could; but now, with that poor boy
in his far home languishing for relief, I had no heart for
learning.</p>

<p>"Three days passed by, and I read the note again. Again its
tenor had changed. It now appeared to say:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"Potations do sometimes wake wines; turnips restrain passion;
causes necessary to state. Infest the poor widow; her lord's
effects will be void. But dirt, bathing, etc., etc., followed
unfairly, will worm him from his folly&mdash;so swear not. Yrxwly,
HEVACE EVEELOJ.'</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>"This was more like it. But I was unable to proceed. I was too
much worn. The word 'turnips' brought temporary joy and
encouragement, but my strength was so much impaired, and the
delay might be so perilous for the boy, that I relinquished the
idea of pursuing the translation further, and resolved to do what
I ought to have done at first. I sat down and wrote Mr. Greeley
as follows:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"DEAR SIR: I fear I do not entirely comprehend your kind note.
It cannot be possible, Sir, that 'turnips restrain passion'&mdash;at
least the study or contemplation of turnips cannot&mdash;for it is
this very employment that has scorched our poor friend's mind and
sapped his bodily strength.&mdash;But if they do restrain it, will you
bear with us a little further and explain how they should be
prepared? I observe that you say 'causes necessary to state,' but
you have omitted to state them.</p>

<p>"Under a misapprehension, you seem to attribute to me
interested motives in this matter&mdash;to call it by no harsher term.
But I assure you, dear sir, that if I seem to be 'infesting the
widow,' it is all seeming, and void of reality. It is from no
seeking of mine that I am in this position. She asked me,
herself, to write you. I never have infested her&mdash;indeed I
scarcely know her. I do not infest anybody. I try to go along, in
my humble way, doing as near right as I can, never harming
anybody, and never throwing out insinuations. As for 'her lord
and his effects,' they are of no interest to me. I trust I have
effects enough of my own&mdash;shall endeavor to get along with them,
at any rate, and not go mousing around to get hold of somebody's
that are 'void.' But do you not see?&mdash;this woman is a widow&mdash;she
has no 'lord.' He is dead&mdash;or pretended to be, when they buried
him. Therefore, no amount of 'dirt, bathing,' etc., etc.,
howsoever 'unfairly followed' will be likely to 'worm him from
his folly'&mdash;if being dead and a ghost is 'folly.' Your closing
remark is as unkind as it was uncalled for; and if report says
true you might have applied it to yourself, sir, with more point
and less impropriety. Very Truly Yours, SIMON ERICKSON.</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>"In the course of a few days, Mr. Greely did what would have
saved a world of trouble, and much mental and bodily suffering
and misunderstanding, if he had done it sooner. To wit, he sent
an intelligible rescript or translation of his original note,
made in a plain hand by his clerk. Then the mystery cleared, and
I saw that his heart had been right, all the time. I will recite
the note in its clarified form:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>[Translation.] 'Potatoes do sometimes make vines; turnips
remain passive: cause unnecessary to state. Inform the poor widow
her lad's efforts will be vain. But diet, bathing, etc. etc.,
followed uniformly, will wean him from his folly&mdash;so fear not.
Yours, HORACE GREELEY.'</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>"But alas, it was too late, gentlemen&mdash;too late. The criminal
delay had done its work&mdash;young Beazely was no more. His spirit
had taken its flight to a land where all anxieties shall be
charmed away, all desires gratified, all ambitions realized. Poor
lad, they laid him to his rest with a turnip in each hand."</p>

<p>So ended Erickson, and lapsed again into nodding, mumbling,
and abstraction. The company broke up, and left him so.... But
they did not say what drove him crazy. In the momentary
confusion, I forgot to ask.</p>
