<h1>A HORSE’S TALE</h1>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br><br><br></div>
<h3>CHAPTER I—SOLDIER BOY—PRIVATELY TO HIMSELF</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>I am Buffalo Bill’s horse.&nbsp; I have spent my life under
his saddle—with him in it, too, and he is good for two hundred
pounds, without his clothes; and there is no telling how much he does
weigh when he is out on the war-path and has his batteries belted on.&nbsp;
He is over six feet, is young, hasn’t an ounce of waste flesh,
is straight, graceful, springy in his motions, quick as a cat, and has
a handsome face, and black hair dangling down on his shoulders, and
is beautiful to look at; and nobody is braver than he is, and nobody
is stronger, except myself.&nbsp; Yes, a person that doubts that he
is fine to see should see him in his beaded buck-skins, on my back and
his rifle peeping above his shoulder, chasing a hostile trail, with
me going like the wind and his hair streaming out behind from the shelter
of his broad slouch.&nbsp; Yes, he is a sight to look at then—and
I’m part of it myself.</p>
<p>I am his favorite horse, out of dozens.&nbsp; Big as he is, I have
carried him eighty-one miles between nightfall and sunrise on the scout;
and I am good for fifty, day in and day out, and all the time.&nbsp;
I am not large, but I am built on a business basis.&nbsp; I have carried
him thousands and thousands of miles on scout duty for the army, and
there’s not a gorge, nor a pass, nor a valley, nor a fort, nor
a trading post, nor a buffalo-range in the whole sweep of the Rocky
Mountains and the Great Plains that we don’t know as well as we
know the bugle-calls.&nbsp; He is Chief of Scouts to the Army of the
Frontier, and it makes us very important.&nbsp; In such a position as
I hold in the military service one needs to be of good family and possess
an education much above the common to be worthy of the place.&nbsp;
I am the best-educated horse outside of the hippodrome, everybody says,
and the best-mannered.&nbsp; It may be so, it is not for me to say;
modesty is the best policy, I think.&nbsp; Buffalo Bill taught me the
most of what I know, my mother taught me much, and I taught myself the
rest.&nbsp; Lay a row of moccasins before me—Pawnee, Sioux, Shoshone,
Cheyenne, Blackfoot, and as many other tribes as you please—and
I can name the tribe every moccasin belongs to by the make of it.&nbsp;
Name it in horse-talk, and could do it in American if I had speech.</p>
<p>I know some of the Indian signs—the signs they make with their
hands, and by signal-fires at night and columns of smoke by day.&nbsp;
Buffalo Bill taught me how to drag wounded soldiers out of the line
of fire with my teeth; and I’ve done it, too; at least I’ve
dragged <i>him</i> out of the battle when he was wounded.&nbsp; And
not just once, but twice.&nbsp; Yes, I know a lot of things.&nbsp; I
remember forms, and gaits, and faces; and you can’t disguise a
person that’s done me a kindness so that I won’t know him
thereafter wherever I find him.&nbsp; I know the art of searching for
a trail, and I know the stale track from the fresh.&nbsp; I can keep
a trail all by myself, with Buffalo Bill asleep in the saddle; ask him—he
will tell you so.&nbsp; Many a time, when he has ridden all night, he
has said to me at dawn, “Take the watch, Boy; if the trail freshens,
call me.”&nbsp; Then he goes to sleep.&nbsp; He knows he can trust
me, because I have a reputation.&nbsp; A scout horse that has a reputation
does not play with it.</p>
<p>My mother was all American—no alkali-spider about <i>her</i>,
I can tell you; she was of the best blood of Kentucky, the bluest Blue-grass
aristocracy, very proud and acrimonious—or maybe it is ceremonious.&nbsp;
I don’t know which it is.&nbsp; But it is no matter; size is the
main thing about a word, and that one’s up to standard.&nbsp;
She spent her military life as colonel of the Tenth Dragoons, and saw
a deal of rough service—distinguished service it was, too.&nbsp;
I mean, she <i>carried</i> the Colonel; but it’s all the same.&nbsp;
Where would he be without his horse?&nbsp; He wouldn’t arrive.&nbsp;
It takes two to make a colonel of dragoons.&nbsp; She was a fine dragoon
horse, but never got above that.&nbsp; She was strong enough for the
scout service, and had the endurance, too, but she couldn’t quite
come up to the speed required; a scout horse has to have steel in his
muscle and lightning in his blood.</p>
<p>My father was a bronco.&nbsp; Nothing as to lineage—that is,
nothing as to recent lineage—but plenty good enough when you go
a good way back.&nbsp; When Professor Marsh was out here hunting bones
for the chapel of Yale University he found skeletons of horses no bigger
than a fox, bedded in the rocks, and he said they were ancestors of
my father.&nbsp; My mother heard him say it; and he said those skeletons
were two million years old, which astonished her and made her Kentucky
pretensions look small and pretty antiphonal, not to say oblique.&nbsp;
Let me see. . . . I used to know the meaning of those words, but . .
. well, it was years ago, and ’tisn’t as vivid now as it
was when they were fresh.&nbsp; That sort of words doesn’t keep,
in the kind of climate we have out here.&nbsp; Professor Marsh said
those skeletons were fossils.&nbsp; So that makes me part blue grass
and part fossil; if there is any older or better stock, you will have
to look for it among the Four Hundred, I reckon.&nbsp; I am satisfied
with it.&nbsp; And am a happy horse, too, though born out of wedlock.</p>
<p>And now we are back at Fort Paxton once more, after a forty-day scout,
away up as far as the Big Horn.&nbsp; Everything quiet.&nbsp; Crows
and Blackfeet squabbling—as usual—but no outbreaks, and
settlers feeling fairly easy.</p>
<p>The Seventh Cavalry still in garrison, here; also the Ninth Dragoons,
two artillery companies, and some infantry.&nbsp; All glad to see me,
including General Alison, commandant.&nbsp; The officers’ ladies
and children well, and called upon me—with sugar.&nbsp; Colonel
Drake, Seventh Cavalry, said some pleasant things; Mrs. Drake was very
complimentary; also Captain and Mrs. Marsh, Company B, Seventh Cavalry;
also the Chaplain, who is always kind and pleasant to me, because I
kicked the lungs out of a trader once.&nbsp; It was Tommy Drake and
Fanny Marsh that furnished the sugar—nice children, the nicest
at the post, I think.</p>
<p>That poor orphan child is on her way from France—everybody
is full of the subject.&nbsp; Her father was General Alison’s
brother; married a beautiful young Spanish lady ten years ago, and has
never been in America since.&nbsp; They lived in Spain a year or two,
then went to France.&nbsp; Both died some months ago.&nbsp; This little
girl that is coming is the only child.&nbsp; General Alison is glad
to have her.&nbsp; He has never seen her.&nbsp; He is a very nice old
bachelor, but is an old bachelor just the same and isn’t more
than about a year this side of retirement by age limit; and so what
does he know about taking care of a little maid nine years old?&nbsp;
If I could have her it would be another matter, for I know all about
children, and they adore me.&nbsp; Buffalo Bill will tell you so himself.</p>
<p>I have some of this news from over-hearing the garrison-gossip, the
rest of it I got from Potter, the General’s dog.&nbsp; Potter
is the great Dane.&nbsp; He is privileged, all over the post, like Shekels,
the Seventh Cavalry’s dog, and visits everybody’s quarters
and picks up everything that is going, in the way of news.&nbsp; Potter
has no imagination, and no great deal of culture, perhaps, but he has
a historical mind and a good memory, and so he is the person I depend
upon mainly to post me up when I get back from a scout.&nbsp; That is,
if Shekels is out on depredation and I can’t get hold of him.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<h3>CHAPTER II—LETTER FROM ROUEN—TO GENERAL ALISON</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>My dear Brother-in-Law,—Please let me write again in Spanish,
I cannot trust my English, and I am aware, from what your brother used
to say, that army officers educated at the Military Academy of the United
States are taught our tongue.&nbsp; It is as I told you in my other
letter: both my poor sister and her husband, when they found they could
not recover, expressed the wish that you should have their little Catherine—as
knowing that you would presently be retired from the army—rather
than that she should remain with me, who am broken in health, or go
to your mother in California, whose health is also frail.</p>
<p>You do not know the child, therefore I must tell you something about
her.&nbsp; You will not be ashamed of her looks, for she is a copy in
little of her beautiful mother—and it is that Andalusian beauty
which is not surpassable, even in your country.&nbsp; She has her mother’s
charm and grace and good heart and sense of justice, and she has her
father’s vivacity and cheerfulness and pluck and spirit of enterprise,
with the affectionate disposition and sincerity of both parents.</p>
<p>My sister pined for her Spanish home all these years of exile; she
was always talking of Spain to the child, and tending and nourishing
the love of Spain in the little thing’s heart as a precious flower;
and she died happy in the knowledge that the fruitage of her patriotic
labors was as rich as even she could desire.</p>
<p>Cathy is a sufficiently good little scholar, for her nine years;
her mother taught her Spanish herself, and kept it always fresh upon
her ear and her tongue by hardly ever speaking with her in any other
tongue; her father was her English teacher, and talked with her in that
language almost exclusively; French has been her everyday speech for
more than seven years among her playmates here; she has a good working
use of governess—German and Italian.&nbsp; It is true that there
is always a faint foreign fragrance about her speech, no matter what
language she is talking, but it is only just noticeable, nothing more,
and is rather a charm than a mar, I think.&nbsp; In the ordinary child-studies
Cathy is neither before nor behind the average child of nine, I should
say.&nbsp; But I can say this for her: in love for her friends and in
high-mindedness and good-heartedness she has not many equals, and in
my opinion no superiors.&nbsp; And I beg of you, let her have her way
with the dumb animals—they are her worship.&nbsp; It is an inheritance
from her mother.&nbsp; She knows but little of cruelties and oppressions—keep
them from her sight if you can.&nbsp; She would flare up at them and
make trouble, in her small but quite decided and resolute way; for she
has a character of her own, and lacks neither promptness nor initiative.&nbsp;
Sometimes her judgment is at fault, but I think her intentions are always
right.&nbsp; Once when she was a little creature of three or four years
she suddenly brought her tiny foot down upon the floor in an apparent
outbreak of indignation, then fetched it a backward wipe, and stooped
down to examine the result.&nbsp; Her mother said:</p>
<p>“Why, what is it, child?&nbsp; What has stirred you so?”</p>
<p>“Mamma, the big ant was trying to kill the little one.”</p>
<p>“And so you protected the little one.”</p>
<p>“Yes, manure, because he had no friend, and I wouldn’t
let the big one kill him.”</p>
<p>“But you have killed them both.”</p>
<p>Cathy was distressed, and her lip trembled.&nbsp; She picked up the
remains and laid them upon her palm, and said:</p>
<p>“Poor little anty, I’m so sorry; and I didn’t mean
to kill you, but there wasn’t any other way to save you, it was
such a hurry.”</p>
<p>She is a dear and sweet little lady, and when she goes it will give
me a sore heart.&nbsp; But she will be happy with you, and if your heart
is old and tired, give it into her keeping; she will make it young again,
she will refresh it, she will make it sing.&nbsp; Be good to her, for
all our sakes!</p>
<p>My exile will soon be over now.&nbsp; As soon as I am a little stronger
I shall see my Spain again; and that will make me young again!</p>
<p>MERCEDES.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III—GENERAL ALISON TO HIS MOTHER</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>I am glad to know that you are all well, in San Bernardino.</p>
<p>. . . That grandchild of yours has been here—well, I do not
quite know how many days it is; nobody can keep account of days or anything
else where she is!&nbsp; Mother, she did what the Indians were never
able to do.&nbsp; She took the Fort—took it the first day!&nbsp;
Took me, too; took the colonels, the captains, the women, the children,
and the dumb brutes; took Buffalo Bill, and all his scouts; took the
garrison—to the last man; and in forty-eight hours the Indian
encampment was hers, illustrious old Thunder-Bird and all.&nbsp; Do
I seem to have lost my solemnity, my gravity, my poise, my dignity?&nbsp;
You would lose your own, in my circumstances.&nbsp; Mother, you never
saw such a winning little devil.&nbsp; She is all energy, and spirit,
and sunshine, and interest in everybody and everything, and pours out
her prodigal love upon every creature that will take it, high or low,
Christian or pagan, feathered or furred; and none has declined it to
date, and none ever will, I think.&nbsp; But she has a temper, and sometimes
it catches fire and flames up, and is likely to burn whatever is near
it; but it is soon over, the passion goes as quickly as it comes.&nbsp;
Of course she has an Indian name already; Indians always rechristen
a stranger early.&nbsp; Thunder-Bird attended to her case.&nbsp; He
gave her the Indian equivalent for firebug, or fire-fly.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>“’Times, ver’ quiet, ver’ soft, like summer
night, but when she mad she blaze.”</p>
<p>Isn’t it good?&nbsp; Can’t you see the flare?&nbsp; She’s
beautiful, mother, beautiful as a picture; and there is a touch of you
in her face, and of her father—poor George! and in her unresting
activities, and her fearless ways, and her sunbursts and cloudbursts,
she is always bringing George back to me.&nbsp; These impulsive natures
are dramatic.&nbsp; George was dramatic, so is this Lightning-Bug, so
is Buffalo Bill.&nbsp; When Cathy first arrived—it was in the
forenoon—Buffalo Bill was away, carrying orders to Major Fuller,
at Five Forks, up in the Clayton Hills.&nbsp; At mid-afternoon I was
at my desk, trying to work, and this sprite had been making it impossible
for half an hour.&nbsp; At last I said:</p>
<p>“Oh, you bewitching little scamp, <i>can’t</i> you be
quiet just a minute or two, and let your poor old uncle attend to a
part of his duties?”</p>
<p>“I’ll try, uncle; I will, indeed,” she said.</p>
<p>“Well, then, that’s a good child—kiss me.&nbsp;
Now, then, sit up in that chair, and set your eye on that clock.&nbsp;
There—that’s right.&nbsp; If you stir—if you so much
as wink—for four whole minutes, I’ll bite you!”</p>
<p>It was very sweet and humble and obedient she looked, sitting there,
still as a mouse; I could hardly keep from setting her free and telling
her to make as much racket as she wanted to.&nbsp; During as much as
two minutes there was a most unnatural and heavenly quiet and repose,
then Buffalo Bill came thundering up to the door in all his scout finery,
flung himself out of the saddle, said to his horse, “Wait for
me, Boy,” and stepped in, and stopped dead in his tracks—gazing
at the child.&nbsp; She forgot orders, and was on the floor in a moment,
saying:</p>
<p>“Oh, you are so beautiful!&nbsp; Do you like me?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t, I love you!” and he gathered her
up with a hug, and then set her on his shoulder—apparently nine
feet from the floor.</p>
<p>She was at home.&nbsp; She played with his long hair, and admired
his big hands and his clothes and his carbine, and asked question after
question, as fast as he could answer, until I excused them both for
half an hour, in order to have a chance to finish my work.&nbsp; Then
I heard Cathy exclaiming over Soldier Boy; and he was worthy of her
raptures, for he is a wonder of a horse, and has a reputation which
is as shining as his own silken hide.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<h3>CHAPTER IV—CATHY TO HER AUNT MERCEDES</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>Oh, it is wonderful here, aunty dear, just paradise!&nbsp; Oh, if
you could only see it! everything so wild and lovely; such grand plains,
stretching such miles and miles and miles, all the most delicious velvety
sand and sage-brush, and rabbits as big as a dog, and such tall and
noble jackassful ears that that is what they name them by; and such
vast mountains, and so rugged and craggy and lofty, with cloud-shawls
wrapped around their shoulders, and looking so solemn and awful and
satisfied; and the charming Indians, oh, how you would dote on them,
aunty dear, and they would on you, too, and they would let you hold
their babies, the way they do me, and they <i>are</i> the fattest, and
brownest, and sweetest little things, and never cry, and wouldn’t
if they had pins sticking in them, which they haven’t, because
they are poor and can’t afford it; and the horses and mules and
cattle and dogs—hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, and not an
animal that you can’t do what you please with, except uncle Thomas,
but <i>I</i> don’t mind him, he’s lovely; and oh, if you
could hear the bugles: <i>too—too—too-too—too—too</i>,
and so on—perfectly beautiful!&nbsp; Do you recognize that one?&nbsp;
It’s the first toots of the <i>reveille</i>; it goes, dear me,
<i>so</i> early in the morning!—then I and every other soldier
on the whole place are up and out in a minute, except uncle Thomas,
who is most unaccountably lazy, I don’t know why, but I have talked
to him about it, and I reckon it will be better, now.&nbsp; He hasn’t
any faults much, and is charming and sweet, like Buffalo Bill, and Thunder-Bird,
and Mammy Dorcas, and Soldier Boy, and Shekels, and Potter, and Sour-Mash,
and—well, they’re <i>all</i> that, just angels, as you may
say.</p>
<p>The very first day I came, I don’t know how long ago it was,
Buffalo Bill took me on Soldier Boy to Thunder-Bird’s camp, not
the big one which is out on the plain, which is White Cloud’s,
he took me to <i>that</i> one next day, but this one is four or five
miles up in the hills and crags, where there is a great shut-in meadow,
full of Indian lodges and dogs and squaws and everything that is interesting,
and a brook of the clearest water running through it, with white pebbles
on the bottom and trees all along the banks cool and shady and good
to wade in, and as the sun goes down it is dimmish in there, but away
up against the sky you see the big peaks towering up and shining bright
and vivid in the sun, and sometimes an eagle sailing by them, not flapping
a wing, the same as if he was asleep; and young Indians and girls romping
and laughing and carrying on, around the spring and the pool, and not
much clothes on except the girls, and dogs fighting, and the squaws
busy at work, and the bucks busy resting, and the old men sitting in
a bunch smoking, and passing the pipe not to the left but to the right,
which means there’s been a row in the camp and they are settling
it if they can, and children playing <i>just</i> the same as any other
children, and little boys shooting at a mark with bows, and I cuffed
one of them because he hit a dog with a club that wasn’t doing
anything, and he resented it but before long he wished he hadn’t:
but this sentence is getting too long and I will start another.&nbsp;
Thunder-Bird put on his Sunday-best war outfit to let me see him, and
he was splendid to look at, with his face painted red and bright and
intense like a fire-coal and a valance of eagle feathers from the top
of his head all down his back, and he had his tomahawk, too, and his
pipe, which has a stem which is longer than my arm, and I never had
such a good time in an Indian camp in my life, and I learned a lot of
words of the language, and next day BB took me to the camp out on the
Plains, four miles, and I had another good time and got acquainted with
some more Indians and dogs; and the big chief, by the name of White
Cloud, gave me a pretty little bow and arrows and I gave him my red
sash-ribbon, and in four days I could shoot very well with it and beat
any white boy of my size at the post; and I have been to those camps
plenty of times since; and I have learned to ride, too, BB taught me,
and every day he practises me and praises me, and every time I do better
than ever he lets me have a scamper on Soldier Boy, and <i>that’s</i>
the last agony of pleasure! for he is the charmingest horse, and so
beautiful and shiny and black, and hasn’t another color on him
anywhere, except a white star in his forehead, not just an imitation
star, but a real one, with four points, shaped exactly like a star that’s
hand-made, and if you should cover him all up but his star you would
know him anywhere, even in Jerusalem or Australia, by that.&nbsp; And
I got acquainted with a good many of the Seventh Cavalry, and the dragoons,
and officers, and families, and horses, in the first few days, and some
more in the next few and the next few and the next few, and now I know
more soldiers and horses than you can think, no matter how hard you
try.&nbsp; I am keeping up my studies every now and then, but there
isn’t much time for it.&nbsp; I love you so! and I send you a
hug and a kiss.</p>
<p>CATHY.</p>
<p>P.S.—I belong to the Seventh Cavalry and Ninth Dragoons, I
am an officer, too, and do not have to work on account of not getting
any wages.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<h3>CHAPTER V—GENERAL ALISON TO MERCEDES</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>She has been with us a good nice long time, now.&nbsp; You are troubled
about your sprite because this is such a wild frontier, hundreds of
miles from civilization, and peopled only by wandering tribes of savages?&nbsp;
You fear for her safety?&nbsp; Give yourself no uneasiness about her.&nbsp;
Dear me, she’s in a nursery! and she’s got more than eighteen
hundred nurses.&nbsp; It would distress the garrison to suspect that
you think they can’t take care of her.&nbsp; They think they can.&nbsp;
They would tell you so themselves.&nbsp; You see, the Seventh Cavalry
has never had a child of its very own before, and neither has the Ninth
Dragoons; and so they are like all new mothers, they think there is
no other child like theirs, no other child so wonderful, none that is
so worthy to be faithfully and tenderly looked after and protected.&nbsp;
These bronzed veterans of mine are very good mothers, I think, and wiser
than some other mothers; for they let her take lots of risks, and it
is a good education for her; and the more risks she takes and comes
successfully out of, the prouder they are of her.&nbsp; They adopted
her, with grave and formal military ceremonies of their own invention—solemnities
is the truer word; solemnities that were so profoundly solemn and earnest,
that the spectacle would have been comical if it hadn’t been so
touching.&nbsp; It was a good show, and as stately and complex as guard-mount
and the trooping of the colors; and it had its own special music, composed
for the occasion by the bandmaster of the Seventh; and the child was
as serious as the most serious war-worn soldier of them all; and finally
when they throned her upon the shoulder of the oldest veteran, and pronounced
her “well and truly adopted,” and the bands struck up and
all saluted and she saluted in return, it was better and more moving
than any kindred thing I have seen on the stage, because stage things
are make-believe, but this was real and the players’ hearts were
in it.</p>
<p>It happened several weeks ago, and was followed by some additional
solemnities.&nbsp; The men created a couple of new ranks, thitherto
unknown to the army regulations, and conferred them upon Cathy, with
ceremonies suitable to a duke.&nbsp; So now she is Corporal-General
of the Seventh Cavalry, and Flag-Lieutenant of the Ninth Dragoons, with
the privilege (decreed by the men) of writing U.S.A. after her name!&nbsp;
Also, they presented her a pair of shoulder-straps—both dark blue,
the one with F. L. on it, the other with C. G.&nbsp; Also, a sword.&nbsp;
She wears them.&nbsp; Finally, they granted her the <i>salute</i>.&nbsp;
I am witness that that ceremony is faithfully observed by both parties—and
most gravely and decorously, too.&nbsp; I have never seen a soldier
smile yet, while delivering it, nor Cathy in returning it.</p>
<p>Ostensibly I was not present at these proceedings, and am ignorant
of them; but I was where I could see.&nbsp; I was afraid of one thing—the
jealousy of the other children of the post; but there is nothing of
that, I am glad to say.&nbsp; On the contrary, they are proud of their
comrade and her honors.&nbsp; It is a surprising thing, but it is true.&nbsp;
The children are devoted to Cathy, for she has turned their dull frontier
life into a sort of continuous festival; also they know her for a stanch
and steady friend, a friend who can always be depended upon, and does
not change with the weather.</p>
<p>She has become a rather extraordinary rider, under the tutorship
of a more than extraordinary teacher—BB, which is her pet name
for Buffalo Bill.&nbsp; She pronounces it <i>beeby</i>.&nbsp; He has
not only taught her seventeen ways of breaking her neck, but twenty-two
ways of avoiding it.&nbsp; He has infused into her the best and surest
protection of a horseman—<i>confidence</i>.&nbsp; He did it gradually,
systematically, little by little, a step at a time, and each step made
sure before the next was essayed.&nbsp; And so he inched her along up
through terrors that had been discounted by training before she reached
them, and therefore were not recognizable as terrors when she got to
them.&nbsp; Well, she is a daring little rider, now, and is perfect
in what she knows of horsemanship.&nbsp; By-and-by she will know the
art like a West Point cadet, and will exercise it as fearlessly.&nbsp;
She doesn’t know anything about side-saddles.&nbsp; Does that
distress you?&nbsp; And she is a fine performer, without any saddle
at all.&nbsp; Does that discomfort you?&nbsp; Do not let it; she is
not in any danger, I give you my word.</p>
<p>You said that if my heart was old and tired she would refresh it,
and you said truly.&nbsp; I do not know how I got along without her,
before.&nbsp; I was a forlorn old tree, but now that this blossoming
vine has wound itself about me and become the life of my life, it is
very different.&nbsp; As a furnisher of business for me and for Mammy
Dorcas she is exhaustlessly competent, but I like my share of it and
of course Dorcas likes hers, for Dorcas “raised” George,
and Cathy is George over again in so many ways that she brings back
Dorcas’s youth and the joys of that long-vanished time.&nbsp;
My father tried to set Dorcas free twenty years ago, when we still lived
in Virginia, but without success; she considered herself a member of
the family, and wouldn’t go.&nbsp; And so, a member of the family
she remained, and has held that position unchallenged ever since, and
holds it now; for when my mother sent her here from San Bernardino when
we learned that Cathy was coming, she only changed from one division
of the family to the other.&nbsp; She has the warm heart of her race,
and its lavish affections, and when Cathy arrived the pair were mother
and child in five minutes, and that is what they are to date and will
continue.&nbsp; Dorcas really thinks she raised George, and that is
one of her prides, but perhaps it was a mutual raising, for their ages
were the same—thirteen years short of mine.&nbsp; But they were
playmates, at any rate; as regards that, there is no room for dispute.</p>
<p>Cathy thinks Dorcas is the best Catholic in America except herself.&nbsp;
She could not pay any one a higher compliment than that, and Dorcas
could not receive one that would please her better.&nbsp; Dorcas is
satisfied that there has never been a more wonderful child than Cathy.&nbsp;
She has conceived the curious idea that Cathy is <i>twins</i>, and that
one of them is a boy-twin and failed to get segregated—got submerged,
is the idea.&nbsp; To argue with her that this is nonsense is a waste
of breath—her mind is made up, and arguments do not affect it.&nbsp;
She says:</p>
<p>“Look at her; she loves dolls, and girl-plays, and everything
a girl loves, and she’s gentle and sweet, and ain’t cruel
to dumb brutes—now that’s the girl-twin, but she loves boy-plays,
and drums and fifes and soldiering, and rough-riding, and ain’t
afraid of anybody or anything—and that’s the boy-twin; ’deed
you needn’t tell <i>me</i> she’s only <i>one</i> child;
no, sir, she’s twins, and one of them got shet up out of sight.&nbsp;
Out of sight, but that don’t make any difference, that boy is
in there, and you can see him look out of her eyes when her temper is
up.”</p>
<p>Then Dorcas went on, in her simple and earnest way, to furnish illustrations.</p>
<p>“Look at that raven, Marse Tom.&nbsp; Would anybody befriend
a raven but that child?&nbsp; Of course they wouldn’t; it ain’t
natural.&nbsp; Well, the Injun boy had the raven tied up, and was all
the time plaguing it and starving it, and she pitied the po’ thing,
and tried to buy it from the boy, and the tears was in her eyes.&nbsp;
That was the girl-twin, you see.&nbsp; She offered him her thimble,
and he flung it down; she offered him all the doughnuts she had, which
was two, and he flung them down; she offered him half a paper of pins,
worth forty ravens, and he made a mouth at her and jabbed one of them
in the raven’s back.&nbsp; That was the limit, you know.&nbsp;
It called for the other twin.&nbsp; Her eyes blazed up, and she jumped
for him like a wild-cat, and when she was done with him she was rags
and he wasn’t anything but an allegory.&nbsp; That was most undoubtedly
the other twin, you see, coming to the front.&nbsp; No, sir; don’t
tell <i>me</i> he ain’t in there.&nbsp; I’ve seen him with
my own eyes—and plenty of times, at that.”</p>
<p>“Allegory?&nbsp; What is an allegory?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Marse Tom, it’s one of her words;
she loves the big ones, you know, and I pick them up from her; they
sound good and I can’t help it.”</p>
<p>“What happened after she had converted the boy into an allegory?”</p>
<p>“Why, she untied the raven and confiscated him by force and
fetched him home, and left the doughnuts and things on the ground.&nbsp;
Petted him, of course, like she does with every creature.&nbsp; In two
days she had him so stuck after her that she—well, <i>you</i>
know how he follows her everywhere, and sets on her shoulder often when
she rides her breakneck rampages—all of which is the girl-twin
to the front, you see—and he does what he pleases, and is up to
all kinds of devilment, and is a perfect nuisance in the kitchen.&nbsp;
Well, they all stand it, but they wouldn’t if it was another person’s
bird.”</p>
<p>Here she began to chuckle comfortably, and presently she said:</p>
<p>“Well, you know, she’s a nuisance herself, Miss Cathy
is, she <i>is</i> so busy, and into everything, like that bird.&nbsp;
It’s all just as innocent, you know, and she don’t mean
any harm, and is so good and dear; and it ain’t her fault, it’s
her nature; her interest is always a-working and always red-hot, and
she can’t keep quiet.&nbsp; Well, yesterday it was ‘Please,
Miss Cathy, don’t do that’; and, ‘Please, Miss Cathy,
let that alone’; and, ‘Please, Miss Cathy, don’t make
so much noise’; and so on and so on, till I reckon I had found
fault fourteen times in fifteen minutes; then she looked up at me with
her big brown eyes that can plead so, and said in that odd little foreign
way that goes to your heart,</p>
<p>“’Please, mammy, make me a compliment.”</p>
<p>“And of course you did it, you old fool?”</p>
<p>“Marse Tom, I just grabbed her up to my breast and says, ‘Oh,
you po’ dear little motherless thing, you ain’t got a fault
in the world, and you can do anything you want to, and tear the house
down, and yo’ old black mammy won’t say a word!’”</p>
<p>“Why, of course, of course—<i>I</i> knew you’d
spoil the child.”</p>
<p>She brushed away her tears, and said with dignity:</p>
<p>“Spoil the child? spoil <i>that</i> child, Marse Tom?&nbsp;
There can’t <i>anybody</i> spoil her.&nbsp; She’s the king
bee of this post, and everybody pets her and is her slave, and yet,
as you know, your own self, she ain’t the least little bit spoiled.”&nbsp;
Then she eased her mind with this retort: “Marse Tom, she makes
you do anything she wants to, and you can’t deny it; so if she
could be spoilt, she’d been spoilt long ago, because you are the
very <i>worst</i>!&nbsp; Look at that pile of cats in your chair, and
you sitting on a candle-box, just as patient; it’s because they’re
her cats.”</p>
<p>If Dorcas were a soldier, I could punish her for such large frankness
as that.&nbsp; I changed the subject, and made her resume her illustrations.&nbsp;
She had scored against me fairly, and I wasn’t going to cheapen
her victory by disputing it.&nbsp; She proceeded to offer this incident
in evidence on her twin theory:</p>
<p>“Two weeks ago when she got her finger mashed open, she turned
pretty pale with the pain, but she never said a word.&nbsp; I took her
in my lap, and the surgeon sponged off the blood and took a needle and
thread and began to sew it up; it had to have a lot of stitches, and
each one made her scrunch a little, but she never let go a sound.&nbsp;
At last the surgeon was so full of admiration that he said, ‘Well,
you <i>are</i> a brave little thing!’ and she said, just as ca’m
and simple as if she was talking about the weather, ‘There isn’t
anybody braver but the Cid!’&nbsp; You see? it was the boy-twin
that the surgeon was a-dealing with.</p>
<p>“Who is the Cid?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, sir—at least only what she says.&nbsp;
She’s always talking about him, and says he was the bravest hero
Spain ever had, or any other country.&nbsp; They have it up and down,
the children do, she standing up for the Cid, and they working George
Washington for all he is worth.”</p>
<p>“Do they quarrel?”</p>
<p>“No; it’s only disputing, and bragging, the way children
do.&nbsp; They want her to be an American, but she can’t be anything
but a Spaniard, she says.&nbsp; You see, her mother was always longing
for home, po’ thing! and thinking about it, and so the child is
just as much a Spaniard as if she’d always lived there.&nbsp;
She thinks she remembers how Spain looked, but I reckon she don’t,
because she was only a baby when they moved to France.&nbsp; She is
very proud to be a Spaniard.”</p>
<p>Does that please you, Mercedes?&nbsp; Very well, be content; your
niece is loyal to her allegiance: her mother laid deep the foundations
of her love for Spain, and she will go back to you as good a Spaniard
as you are yourself.&nbsp; She has made me promise to take her to you
for a long visit when the War Office retires me.</p>
<p>I attend to her studies myself; has she told you that?&nbsp; Yes,
I am her school-master, and she makes pretty good progress, I think,
everything considered.&nbsp; Everything considered—being translated—means
holidays.&nbsp; But the fact is, she was not born for study, and it
comes hard.&nbsp; Hard for me, too; it hurts me like a physical pain
to see that free spirit of the air and the sunshine laboring and grieving
over a book; and sometimes when I find her gazing far away towards the
plain and the blue mountains with the longing in her eyes, I have to
throw open the prison doors; I can’t help it.&nbsp; A quaint little
scholar she is, and makes plenty of blunders.&nbsp; Once I put the question:</p>
<p>“What does the Czar govern?”</p>
<p>She rested her elbow on her knee and her chin on her hand and took
that problem under deep consideration.&nbsp; Presently she looked up
and answered, with a rising inflection implying a shade of uncertainty,</p>
<p>“The dative case?”</p>
<p>Here are a couple of her expositions which were delivered with tranquil
confidence:</p>
<p>“<i>Chaplain</i>, diminutive of chap.&nbsp; <i>Lass</i> is
masculine, <i>lassie</i> is feminine.”</p>
<p>She is not a genius, you see, but just a normal child; they all make
mistakes of that sort.&nbsp; There is a glad light in her eye which
is pretty to see when she finds herself able to answer a question promptly
and accurately, without any hesitation; as, for instance, this morning:</p>
<p>“Cathy dear, what is a cube?”</p>
<p>“Why, a native of Cuba.”</p>
<p>She still drops a foreign word into her talk now and then, and there
is still a subtle foreign flavor or fragrance about even her exactest
English—and long may this abide! for it has for me a charm that
is very pleasant.&nbsp; Sometimes her English is daintily prim and bookish
and captivating.&nbsp; She has a child’s sweet tooth, but for
her health’s sake I try to keep its inspirations under cheek.&nbsp;
She is obedient—as is proper for a titled and recognized military
personage, which she is—but the chain presses sometimes.&nbsp;
For instance, we were out for a walk, and passed by some bushes that
were freighted with wild goose-berries.&nbsp; Her face brightened and
she put her hands together and delivered herself of this speech, most
feelingly:</p>
<p>“Oh, if I was permitted a vice it would be the <i>gourmandise</i>!”</p>
<p>Could I resist that?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I gave her a gooseberry.</p>
<p>You ask about her languages.&nbsp; They take care of themselves;
they will not get rusty here; our regiments are not made up of natives
alone—far from it.&nbsp; And she is picking up Indian tongues
diligently.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI—SOLDIER BOY AND THE MEXICAN PLUG</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>“When did you come?”</p>
<p>“Arrived at sundown.”</p>
<p>“Where from?”</p>
<p>“Salt Lake.”</p>
<p>“Are you in the service?”</p>
<p>“No.&nbsp; Trade.”</p>
<p>“Pirate trade, I reckon.”</p>
<p>“What do you know about it?”</p>
<p>“I saw you when you came.&nbsp; I recognized your master.&nbsp;
He is a bad sort.&nbsp; Trap-robber, horse-thief, squaw-man, renegado—Hank
Butters—I know him very well.&nbsp; Stole you, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>“Well, it amounted to that.”</p>
<p>“I thought so.&nbsp; Where is his pard?”</p>
<p>“He stopped at White Cloud’s camp.”</p>
<p>“He is another of the same stripe, is Blake Haskins.”&nbsp;
(<i>Aside</i>.)&nbsp; They are laying for Buffalo Bill again, I guess.&nbsp;
(<i>Aloud</i>.)&nbsp; “What is your name?”</p>
<p>“Which one?”</p>
<p>“Have you got more than one?”</p>
<p>“I get a new one every time I’m stolen.&nbsp; I used
to have an honest name, but that was early; I’ve forgotten it.&nbsp;
Since then I’ve had thirteen <i>aliases</i>.”</p>
<p>“Aliases?&nbsp; What is alias?”</p>
<p>“A false name.”</p>
<p>“Alias.&nbsp; It’s a fine large word, and is in my line;
it has quite a learned and cerebrospinal incandescent sound.&nbsp; Are
you educated?”</p>
<p>“Well, no, I can’t claim it.&nbsp; I can take down bars,
I can distinguish oats from shoe-pegs, I can blaspheme a saddle-boil
with the college-bred, and I know a few other things—not many;
I have had no chance, I have always had to work; besides, I am of low
birth and no family.&nbsp; You speak my dialect like a native, but you
are not a Mexican Plug, you are a gentleman, I can see that; and educated,
of course.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am of old family, and not illiterate.&nbsp; I am a
fossil.”</p>
<p>“A which?”</p>
<p>“Fossil.&nbsp; The first horses were fossils.&nbsp; They date
back two million years.”</p>
<p>“Gr-eat sand and sage-brush! do you mean it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is true.&nbsp; The bones of my ancestors are held
in reverence and worship, even by men.&nbsp; They do not leave them
exposed to the weather when they find them, but carry them three thousand
miles and enshrine them in their temples of learning, and worship them.”</p>
<p>“It is wonderful!&nbsp; I knew you must be a person of distinction,
by your fine presence and courtly address, and by the fact that you
are not subjected to the indignity of hobbles, like myself and the rest.&nbsp;
Would you tell me your name?”</p>
<p>“You have probably heard of it—Soldier Boy.”</p>
<p>“What!—the renowned, the illustrious?”</p>
<p>“Even so.”</p>
<p>“It takes my breath!&nbsp; Little did I dream that ever I should
stand face to face with the possessor of that great name.&nbsp; Buffalo
Bill’s horse!&nbsp; Known from the Canadian border to the deserts
of Arizona, and from the eastern marches of the Great Plains to the
foot-hills of the Sierra!&nbsp; Truly this is a memorable day.&nbsp;
You still serve the celebrated Chief of Scouts?”</p>
<p>“I am still his property, but he has lent me, for a time, to
the most noble, the most gracious, the most excellent, her Excellency
Catherine, Corporal-General Seventh Cavalry and Flag-Lieutenant Ninth
Dragoons, U.S.A.,—on whom be peace!”</p>
<p>“Amen.&nbsp; Did you say <i>her</i> Excellency?”</p>
<p>“The same.&nbsp; A Spanish lady, sweet blossom of a ducal house.&nbsp;
And truly a wonder; knowing everything, capable of everything; speaking
all the languages, master of all sciences, a mind without horizons,
a heart of gold, the glory of her race!&nbsp; On whom be peace!”</p>
<p>“Amen.&nbsp; It is marvellous!”</p>
<p>“Verily.&nbsp; I knew many things, she has taught me others.&nbsp;
I am educated.&nbsp; I will tell you about her.”</p>
<p>“I listen—I am enchanted.”</p>
<p>“I will tell a plain tale, calmly, without excitement, without
eloquence.&nbsp; When she had been here four or five weeks she was already
erudite in military things, and they made her an officer—a double
officer.&nbsp; She rode the drill every day, like any soldier; and she
could take the bugle and direct the evolutions herself.&nbsp; Then,
on a day, there was a grand race, for prizes—none to enter but
the children.&nbsp; Seventeen children entered, and she was the youngest.&nbsp;
Three girls, fourteen boys—good riders all.&nbsp; It was a steeplechase,
with four hurdles, all pretty high.&nbsp; The first prize was a most
cunning half-grown silver bugle, and mighty pretty, with red silk cord
and tassels.&nbsp; Buffalo Bill was very anxious; for he had taught
her to ride, and he did most dearly want her to win that race, for the
glory of it.&nbsp; So he wanted her to ride me, but she wouldn’t;
and she reproached him, and said it was unfair and unright, and taking
advantage; for what horse in this post or any other could stand a chance
against me? and she was very severe with him, and said, ‘You ought
to be ashamed—you are proposing to me conduct unbecoming an officer
and a gentleman.’&nbsp; So he just tossed her up in the air about
thirty feet and caught her as she came down, and said he was ashamed;
and put up his handkerchief and pretended to cry, which nearly broke
her heart, and she petted him, and begged him to forgive her, and said
she would do anything in the world he could ask but that; but he said
he ought to go hang himself, and he <i>must</i>, if he could get a rope;
it was nothing but right he should, for he never, never could forgive
himself; and then <i>she</i> began to cry, and they both sobbed, the
way you could hear him a mile, and she clinging around his neck and
pleading, till at last he was comforted a little, and gave his solemn
promise he wouldn’t hang himself till after the race; and wouldn’t
do it at all if she won it, which made her happy, and she said she would
win it or die in the saddle; so then everything was pleasant again and
both of them content.&nbsp; He can’t help playing jokes on her,
he is so fond of her and she is so innocent and unsuspecting; and when
she finds it out she cuffs him and is in a fury, but presently forgives
him because it’s him; and maybe the very next day she’s
caught with another joke; you see she can’t learn any better,
because she hasn’t any deceit in her, and that kind aren’t
ever expecting it in another person.</p>
<p>“It was a grand race.&nbsp; The whole post was there, and there
was such another whooping and shouting when the seventeen kids came
flying down the turf and sailing over the hurdles—oh, beautiful
to see!&nbsp; Half-way down, it was kind of neck and neck, and anybody’s
race and nobody’s.&nbsp; Then, what should happen but a cow steps
out and puts her head down to munch grass, with her broadside to the
battalion, and they a-coming like the wind; they split apart to flank
her, but <i>she</i>?—why, she drove the spurs home and soared
over that cow like a bird! and on she went, and cleared the last hurdle
solitary and alone, the army letting loose the grand yell, and she skipped
from the horse the same as if he had been standing still, and made her
bow, and everybody crowded around to congratulate, and they gave her
the bugle, and she put it to her lips and blew ‘boots and saddles’
to see how it would go, and BB was as proud as you can’t think!&nbsp;
And he said, ‘Take Soldier Boy, and don’t pass him back
till I ask for him!’ and I can tell you he wouldn’t have
said that to any other person on this planet.&nbsp; That was two months
and more ago, and nobody has been on my back since but the Corporal-General
Seventh Cavalry and Flag-Lieutenant of the Ninth Dragoons, U.S.A.,—on
whom be peace!”</p>
<p>“Amen.&nbsp; I listen—tell me more.”</p>
<p>“She set to work and organized the Sixteen, and called it the
First Battalion Rocky Mountain Rangers, U.S.A., and she wanted to be
bugler, but they elected her Lieutenant-General and Bugler.&nbsp; So
she ranks her uncle the commandant, who is only a Brigadier.&nbsp; And
doesn’t she train those little people!&nbsp; Ask the Indians,
ask the traders, ask the soldiers; they’ll tell you.&nbsp; She
has been at it from the first day.&nbsp; Every morning they go clattering
down into the plain, and there she sits on my back with her bugle at
her mouth and sounds the orders and puts them through the evolutions
for an hour or more; and it is too beautiful for anything to see those
ponies dissolve from one formation into another, and waltz about, and
break, and scatter, and form again, always moving, always graceful,
now trotting, now galloping, and so on, sometimes near by, sometimes
in the distance, all just like a state ball, you know, and sometimes
she can’t hold herself any longer, but sounds the ‘charge,’
and turns me loose! and you can take my word for it, if the battalion
hasn’t too much of a start we catch up and go over the breastworks
with the front line.</p>
<p>“Yes, they are soldiers, those little people; and healthy,
too, not ailing any more, the way they used to be sometimes.&nbsp; It’s
because of her drill.&nbsp; She’s got a fort, now—Fort Fanny
Marsh.&nbsp; Major-General Tommy Drake planned it out, and the Seventh
and Dragoons built it.&nbsp; Tommy is the Colonel’s son, and is
fifteen and the oldest in the Battalion; Fanny Marsh is Brigadier-General,
and is next oldest—over thirteen.&nbsp; She is daughter of Captain
Marsh, Company B, Seventh Cavalry.&nbsp; Lieutenant-General Alison is
the youngest by considerable; I think she is about nine and a half or
three-quarters.&nbsp; Her military rig, as Lieutenant-General, isn’t
for business, it’s for dress parade, because the ladies made it.&nbsp;
They say they got it out of the Middle Ages—out of a book—and
it is all red and blue and white silks and satins and velvets; tights,
trunks, sword, doublet with slashed sleeves, short cape, cap with just
one feather in it; I’ve heard them name these things; they got
them out of the book; she’s dressed like a page, of old times,
they say.&nbsp; It’s the daintiest outfit that ever was—you
will say so, when you see it.&nbsp; She’s lovely in it—oh,
just a dream!&nbsp; In some ways she is just her age, but in others
she’s as old as her uncle, I think.&nbsp; She is very learned.&nbsp;
She teaches her uncle his book.&nbsp; I have seen her sitting by with
the book and reciting to him what is in it, so that he can learn to
do it himself.</p>
<p>“Every Saturday she hires little Injuns to garrison her fort;
then she lays siege to it, and makes military approaches by make-believe
trenches in make-believe night, and finally at make-believe dawn she
draws her sword and sounds the assault and takes it by storm.&nbsp;
It is for practice.&nbsp; And she has invented a bugle-call all by herself,
out of her own head, and it’s a stirring one, and the prettiest
in the service.&nbsp; It’s to call <i>me</i>—it’s
never used for anything else.&nbsp; She taught it to me, and told me
what it says: ‘<i>It is I</i>, <i>Soldier—come</i>!’
and when those thrilling notes come floating down the distance I hear
them without fail, even if I am two miles away; and then—oh, then
you should see my heels get down to business!</p>
<p>“And she has taught me how to say good-morning and good-night
to her, which is by lifting my right hoof for her to shake; and also
how to say good-bye; I do that with my left foot—but only for
practice, because there hasn’t been any but make-believe good-byeing
yet, and I hope there won’t ever be.&nbsp; It would make me cry
if I ever had to put up my left foot in earnest.&nbsp; She has taught
me how to salute, and I can do it as well as a soldier.&nbsp; I bow
my head low, and lay my right hoof against my cheek.&nbsp; She taught
me that because I got into disgrace once, through ignorance.&nbsp; I
am privileged, because I am known to be honorable and trustworthy, and
because I have a distinguished record in the service; so they don’t
hobble me nor tie me to stakes or shut me tight in stables, but let
me wander around to suit myself.&nbsp; Well, trooping the colors is
a very solemn ceremony, and everybody must stand uncovered when the
flag goes by, the commandant and all; and once I was there, and ignorantly
walked across right in front of the band, which was an awful disgrace:
Ah, the Lieutenant-General was so ashamed, and so distressed that I
should have done such a thing before all the world, that she couldn’t
keep the tears back; and then she taught me the salute, so that if I
ever did any other unmilitary act through ignorance I could do my salute
and she believed everybody would think it was apology enough and would
not press the matter.&nbsp; It is very nice and distinguished; no other
horse can do it; often the men salute me, and I return it.&nbsp; I am
privileged to be present when the Rocky Mountain Rangers troop the colors
and I stand solemn, like the children, and I salute when the flag goes
by.&nbsp; Of course when she goes to her fort her sentries sing out
‘Turn out the guard!’ and then . . . do you catch that refreshing
early-morning whiff from the mountain-pines and the wild flowers?&nbsp;
The night is far spent; we’ll hear the bugles before long.&nbsp;
Dorcas, the black woman, is very good and nice; she takes care of the
Lieutenant-General, and is Brigadier-General Alison’s mother,
which makes her mother-in-law to the Lieutenant-General.&nbsp; That
is what Shekels says.&nbsp; At least it is what I think he says, though
I never can understand him quite clearly. He—”</p>
<p>“Who is Shekels?”</p>
<p>“The Seventh Cavalry dog.&nbsp; I mean, if he <i>is</i> a dog.&nbsp;
His father was a coyote and his mother was a wild-cat.&nbsp; It doesn’t
really make a dog out of him, does it?”</p>
<p>“Not a real dog, I should think.&nbsp; Only a kind of a general
dog, at most, I reckon.&nbsp; Though this is a matter of ichthyology,
I suppose; and if it is, it is out of my depth, and so my opinion is
not valuable, and I don’t claim much consideration for it.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t ichthyology; it is dogmatics, which is still
more difficult and tangled up.&nbsp; Dogmatics always are.”</p>
<p>“Dogmatics is quite beyond me, quite; so I am not competing.&nbsp;
But on general principles it is my opinion that a colt out of a coyote
and a wild-cat is no square dog, but doubtful.&nbsp; That is my hand,
and I stand pat.”</p>
<p>“Well, it is as far as I can go myself, and be fair and conscientious.&nbsp;
I have always regarded him as a doubtful dog, and so has Potter.&nbsp;
Potter is the great Dane.&nbsp; Potter says he is no dog, and not even
poultry—though I do not go quite so far as that.</p>
<p>“And I wouldn’t, myself.&nbsp; Poultry is one of those
things which no person can get to the bottom of, there is so much of
it and such variety.&nbsp; It is just wings, and wings, and wings, till
you are weary: turkeys, and geese, and bats, and butterflies, and angels,
and grasshoppers, and flying-fish, and—well, there is really no
end to the tribe; it gives me the heaves just to think of it.&nbsp;
But this one hasn’t any wings, has he?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, in my belief he is more likely to be dog than
poultry.&nbsp; I have not heard of poultry that hadn’t wings.&nbsp;
Wings is the <i>sign</i> of poultry; it is what you tell poultry by.&nbsp;
Look at the mosquito.”</p>
<p>“What do you reckon he is, then?&nbsp; He must be something.”</p>
<p>“Why, he could be a reptile; anything that hasn’t wings
is a reptile.”</p>
<p>“Who told you that?”</p>
<p>“Nobody told me, but I overheard it.”</p>
<p>“Where did you overhear it?”</p>
<p>“Years ago.&nbsp; I was with the Philadelphia Institute expedition
in the Bad Lands under Professor Cope, hunting mastodon bones, and I
overheard him say, his own self, that any plantigrade circumflex vertebrate
bacterium that hadn’t wings and was uncertain was a reptile.&nbsp;
Well, then, has this dog any wings?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Is he a plantigrade
circumflex vertebrate bacterium?&nbsp; Maybe so, maybe not; but without
ever having seen him, and judging only by his illegal and spectacular
parentage, I will bet the odds of a bale of hay to a bran mash that
he looks it.&nbsp; Finally, is he uncertain?&nbsp; That is the point—is
he uncertain?&nbsp; I will leave it to you if you have ever heard of
a more uncertainer dog than what this one is?”</p>
<p>“No, I never have.”</p>
<p>“Well, then, he’s a reptile.&nbsp; That’s settled.”</p>
<p>“Why, look here, whatsyourname”</p>
<p>“Last alias, Mongrel.”</p>
<p>“A good one, too.&nbsp; I was going to say, you are better
educated than you have been pretending to be.&nbsp; I like cultured
society, and I shall cultivate your acquaintance.&nbsp; Now as to Shekels,
whenever you want to know about any private thing that is going on at
this post or in White Cloud’s camp or Thunder-Bird’s, he
can tell you; and if you make friends with him he’ll be glad to,
for he is a born gossip, and picks up all the tittle-tattle.&nbsp; Being
the whole Seventh Cavalry’s reptile, he doesn’t belong to
anybody in particular, and hasn’t any military duties; so he comes
and goes as he pleases, and is popular with all the house cats and other
authentic sources of private information.&nbsp; He understands all the
languages, and talks them all, too.&nbsp; With an accent like gritting
your teeth, it is true, and with a grammar that is no improvement on
blasphemy—still, with practice you get at the meat of what he
says, and it serves. . . Hark!&nbsp; That’s the reveille. . .
.</p>
<p>[THE REVEILLE]</p>
<p>“Faint and far, but isn’t it clear, isn’t it sweet?&nbsp;
There’s no music like the bugle to stir the blood, in the still
solemnity of the morning twilight, with the dim plain stretching away
to nothing and the spectral mountains slumbering against the sky.&nbsp;
You’ll hear another note in a minute—faint and far and clear,
like the other one, and sweeter still, you’ll notice.&nbsp; Wait
. . . listen.&nbsp; There it goes!&nbsp; It says, ‘<i>It is I,
Soldier—come</i>!’ . . .</p>

<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>“Did you do as I told you?&nbsp; Did you look up the Mexican
Plug?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I made his acquaintance before night and got his friendship.”</p>
<p>“I liked him.&nbsp; Did you?”</p>
<p>“Not at first.&nbsp; He took me for a reptile, and it troubled
me, because I didn’t know whether it was a compliment or not.&nbsp;
I couldn’t ask him, because it would look ignorant.&nbsp; So I
didn’t say anything, and soon liked him very well indeed.&nbsp;
Was it a compliment, do you think?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is what it was.&nbsp; They are very rare, the reptiles;
very few left, now-a-days.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?&nbsp; What is a reptile?”</p>
<p>“It is a plantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium that hasn’t
any wings and is uncertain.”</p>
<p>“Well, it—it sounds fine, it surely does.”</p>
<p>“And it <i>is</i> fine.&nbsp; You may be thankful you are one.”</p>
<p>“I am.&nbsp; It seems wonderfully grand and elegant for a person
that is so humble as I am; but I am thankful, I am indeed, and will
try to live up to it.&nbsp; It is hard to remember.&nbsp; Will you say
it again, please, and say it slow?”</p>
<p>“Plantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium that hasn’t
any wings and is uncertain.”</p>
<p>“It is beautiful, anybody must grant it; beautiful, and of
a noble sound.&nbsp; I hope it will not make me proud and stuck-up—I
should not like to be that.&nbsp; It is much more distinguished and
honorable to be a reptile than a dog, don’t you think, Soldier?”</p>
<p>“Why, there’s no comparison.&nbsp; It is awfully aristocratic.&nbsp;
Often a duke is called a reptile; it is set down so, in history.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that grand!&nbsp; Potter wouldn’t ever associate
with me, but I reckon he’ll be glad to when he finds out what
I am.”</p>
<p>“You can depend upon it.”</p>
<p>“I will thank Mongrel for this. He is a very good sort, for
a Mexican Plug.&nbsp; Don’t you think he is?”</p>
<p>“It is my opinion of him; and as for his birth, he cannot help
that.&nbsp; We cannot all be reptiles, we cannot all be fossils; we
have to take what comes and be thankful it is no worse.&nbsp; It is
the true philosophy.”</p>
<p>“For those others?”</p>
<p>“Stick to the subject, please.&nbsp; Did it turn out that my
suspicions were right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, perfectly right.&nbsp; Mongrel has heard them planning.&nbsp;
They are after BB’s life, for running them out of Medicine Bow
and taking their stolen horses away from them.”</p>
<p>“Well, they’ll get him yet, for sure.”</p>
<p>“Not if he keeps a sharp look-out.”</p>
<p>“<i>He</i> keep a sharp lookout!&nbsp; He never does; he despises
them, and all their kind.&nbsp; His life is always being threatened,
and so it has come to be monotonous.”</p>
<p>“Does he know they are here?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, he knows it.&nbsp; He is always the earliest to know
who comes and who goes.&nbsp; But he cares nothing for them and their
threats; he only laughs when people warn him.&nbsp; They’ll shoot
him from behind a tree the first he knows.&nbsp; Did Mongrel tell you
their plans?”</p>
<p>“Yes.&nbsp; They have found out that he starts for Fort Clayton
day after to-morrow, with one of his scouts; so they will leave to-morrow,
letting on to go south, but they will fetch around north all in good
time.”</p>
<p>“Shekels, I don’t like the look of it.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII—THE SCOUT-START.&nbsp; BB AND LIEUTENANT-GENERAL
ALISON</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>BB (<i>saluting</i>).&nbsp; “Good! handsomely done!&nbsp; The
Seventh couldn’t beat it!&nbsp; You do certainly handle your Rangers
like an expert, General.&nbsp; And where are you bound?”</p>
<p>“Four miles on the trail to Fort Clayton.”</p>
<p>“Glad am I, dear!&nbsp; What’s the idea of it?”</p>
<p>“Guard of honor for you and Thorndike.”</p>
<p>“Bless—your—<i>heart</i>!&nbsp; I’d rather
have it from you than from the Commander-in-Chief of the armies of the
United States, you incomparable little soldier!—and I don’t
need to take any oath to that, for you to believe it.”</p>
<p>“I <i>thought</i> you’d like it, BB.”</p>
<p><i>“Like</i> it?&nbsp; Well, I should say so!&nbsp; Now then—all
ready—sound the advance, and away we go!”</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<h3>CHAPTER IX—SOLDIER BOY AND SHEKELS AGAIN</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>“Well, this is the way it happened.&nbsp; We did the escort
duty; then we came back and struck for the plain and put the Rangers
through a rousing drill—oh, for hours!&nbsp; Then we sent them
home under Brigadier-General Fanny Marsh; then the Lieutenant-General
and I went off on a gallop over the plains for about three hours, and
were lazying along home in the middle of the afternoon, when we met
Jimmy Slade, the drummer-boy, and he saluted and asked the Lieutenant-General
if she had heard the news, and she said no, and he said:</p>
<p>“‘Buffalo Bill has been ambushed and badly shot this
side of Clayton, and Thorndike the scout, too; Bill couldn’t travel,
but Thorndike could, and he brought the news, and Sergeant Wilkes and
six men of Company B are gone, two hours ago, hotfoot, to get Bill.&nbsp;
And they say—’</p>
<p>“‘<i>Go</i>!’ she shouts to me—and I went.”</p>
<p>“Fast?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ask foolish questions.&nbsp; It was an awful pace.&nbsp;
For four hours nothing happened, and not a word said, except that now
and then she said, ‘Keep it up, Boy, keep it up, sweetheart; we’ll
save him!’&nbsp; I kept it up.&nbsp; Well, when the dark shut
down, in the rugged hills, that poor little chap had been tearing around
in the saddle all day, and I noticed by the slack knee-pressure that
she was tired and tottery, and I got dreadfully afraid; but every time
I tried to slow down and let her go to sleep, so I could stop, she hurried
me up again; and so, sure enough, at last over she went!</p>
<p>“Ah, that was a fix to be in I for she lay there and didn’t
stir, and what was I to do?&nbsp; I couldn’t leave her to fetch
help, on account of the wolves.&nbsp; There was nothing to do but stand
by.&nbsp; It was dreadful.&nbsp; I was afraid she was killed, poor little
thing!&nbsp; But she wasn’t.&nbsp; She came to, by-and-by, and
said, ‘Kiss me, Soldier,’ and those were blessed words.&nbsp;
I kissed her—often; I am used to that, and we like it.&nbsp; But
she didn’t get up, and I was worried.&nbsp; She fondled my nose
with her hand, and talked to me, and called me endearing names—which
is her way—but she caressed with the same hand all the time.&nbsp;
The other arm was broken, you see, but I didn’t know it, and she
didn’t mention it.&nbsp; She didn’t want to distress me,
you know.</p>
<p>“Soon the big gray wolves came, and hung around, and you could
hear them snarl, and snap at each other, but you couldn’t see
anything of them except their eyes, which shone in the dark like sparks
and stars.&nbsp; The Lieutenant-General said, ‘If I had the Rocky
Mountain Rangers here, we would make those creatures climb a tree.’&nbsp;
Then she made believe that the Rangers were in hearing, and put up her
bugle and blew the ‘assembly’; and then, ‘boots and
saddles’; then the ‘trot’; ‘gallop’; ‘charge!’&nbsp;
Then she blew the ‘retreat,’ and said, ‘That’s
for you, you rebels; the Rangers don’t ever retreat!’</p>
<p>“The music frightened them away, but they were hungry, and
kept coming back.&nbsp; And of course they got bolder and bolder, which
is their way.&nbsp; It went on for an hour, then the tired child went
to sleep, and it was pitiful to hear her moan and nestle, and I couldn’t
do anything for her.&nbsp; All the time I was laying for the wolves.&nbsp;
They are in my line; I have had experience.&nbsp; At last the boldest
one ventured within my lines, and I landed him among his friends with
some of his skull still on him, and they did the rest.&nbsp; In the
next hour I got a couple more, and they went the way of the first one,
down the throats of the detachment.&nbsp; That satisfied the survivors,
and they went away and left us in peace.</p>
<p>“We hadn’t any more adventures, though I kept awake all
night and was ready.&nbsp; From midnight on the child got very restless,
and out of her head, and moaned, and said, ‘Water, water—thirsty’;
and now and then, ‘Kiss me, Soldier’; and sometimes she
was in her fort and giving orders to her garrison; and once she was
in Spain, and thought her mother was with her.&nbsp; People say a horse
can’t cry; but they don’t know, because we cry inside.</p>
<p>“It was an hour after sunup that I heard the boys coming, and
recognized the hoof-beats of Pomp and Caesar and Jerry, old mates of
mine; and a welcomer sound there couldn’t ever be.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bill was in a horse-litter, with his leg broken by a bullet,
and Mongrel and Blake Haskins’s horse were doing the work.&nbsp;
Buffalo Bill and Thorndike had lolled both of those toughs.</p>
<p>“When they got to us, and Buffalo Bill saw the child lying
there so white, he said, ‘My God!’ and the sound of his
voice brought her to herself, and she gave a little cry of pleasure
and struggled to get up, but couldn’t, and the soldiers gathered
her up like the tenderest women, and their eyes were wet and they were
not ashamed, when they saw her arm dangling; and so were Buffalo Bill’s,
and when they laid her in his arms he said, ‘My darling, how does
this come?’ and she said, ‘We came to save you, but I was
tired, and couldn’t keep awake, and fell off and hurt myself,
and couldn’t get on again.’&nbsp; ‘You came to save
me, you dear little rat?&nbsp; It was too lovely of you!’&nbsp;
‘Yes, and Soldier stood by me, which you know he would, and protected
me from the wolves; and if he got a chance he kicked the life out of
some of them—for you know he would, BB.’&nbsp; The sergeant
said, ‘He laid out three of them, sir, and here’s the bones
to show for it.’&nbsp; ‘He’s a grand horse,’
said BB; ‘he’s the grandest horse that ever was! and has
saved your life, Lieutenant-General Alison, and shall protect it the
rest of his life—he’s yours for a kiss!’&nbsp; He
got it, along with a passion of delight, and he said, ‘You are
feeling better now, little Spaniard—do you think you could blow
the advance?’&nbsp; She put up the bugle to do it, but he said
wait a minute first.&nbsp; Then he and the sergeant set her arm and
put it in splints, she wincing but not whimpering; then we took up the
march for home, and that’s the end of the tale; and I’m
her horse.&nbsp; Isn’t she a brick, Shekels?</p>
<p>“Brick?&nbsp; She’s more than a brick, more than a thousand
bricks—she’s a reptile!”</p>
<p>“It’s a compliment out of your heart, Shekels.&nbsp;
God bless you for it!”</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<h3>CHAPTER X—GENERAL ALISON AND DORCAS</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>“Too much company for her, Marse Tom.&nbsp; Betwixt you, and
Shekels, the Colonel’s wife, and the Cid—”</p>
<p>“The Cid?&nbsp; Oh, I remember—the raven.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;“—and Mrs. Captain Marsh and Famine and Pestilence
the baby <i>coyotes</i>, and Sour-Mash and her pups, and Sardanapalus
and her kittens—hang these names she gives the creatures, they
warp my jaw—and Potter: you—all sitting around in the house,
and Soldier Boy at the window the entire time, it’s a wonder to
me she comes along as well as she does.&nbsp; She—”</p>
<p>“You want her all to yourself, you stingy old thing!”</p>
<p>“Marse Tom, you know better.&nbsp; It’s too much company.&nbsp;
And then the idea of her receiving reports all the time from her officers,
and acting upon them, and giving orders, the same as if she was well!&nbsp;
It ain’t good for her, and the surgeon don’t like it, and
tried to persuade her not to and couldn’t; and when he <i>ordered</i>
her, she was that outraged and indignant, and was very severe on him,
and accused him of insubordination, and said it didn’t become
him to give orders to an officer of her rank.&nbsp; Well, he saw he
had excited her more and done more harm than all the rest put together,
so he was vexed at himself and wished he had kept still.&nbsp; Doctors
<i>don’t</i> know much, and that’s a fact.&nbsp; She’s
too much interested in things—she ought to rest more.&nbsp; She’s
all the time sending messages to BB, and to soldiers and Injuns and
whatnot, and to the animals.”</p>
<p>“To the animals?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Who carries them?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes Potter, but mostly it’s Shekels.”</p>
<p>“Now come! who can find fault with such pretty make-believe
as that?”</p>
<p>“But it ain’t make-believe, Marse Tom.&nbsp; She does
send them.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I don’t doubt that part of it.”</p>
<p>“Do you doubt they get them, sir?”</p>
<p>“Certainly.&nbsp; Don’t you?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.&nbsp; Animals talk to one another.&nbsp; I know it
perfectly well, Marse Tom, and I ain’t saying it by guess.”</p>
<p>“What a curious superstition!”</p>
<p>“It ain’t a superstition, Marse Tom.&nbsp; Look at that
Shekels—look at him, <i>now</i>.&nbsp; Is he listening, or ain’t
he?&nbsp; <i>Now</i> you see! he’s turned his head away.&nbsp;
It’s because he was caught—caught in the act.&nbsp; I’ll
ask you—could a Christian look any more ashamed than what he looks
now?—<i>lay down</i>!&nbsp; You see? he was going to sneak out.&nbsp;
Don’t tell <i>me</i>, Marse Tom!&nbsp; If animals don’t
talk, I miss <i>my</i> guess.&nbsp; And Shekels is the worst.&nbsp;
He goes and tells the animals everything that happens in the officers’
quarters; and if he’s short of facts, he invents them.&nbsp; He
hasn’t any more principle than a blue jay; and as for morals,
he’s empty.&nbsp; Look at him now; look at him grovel.&nbsp; He
knows what I am saying, and he knows it’s the truth.&nbsp; You
see, yourself, that he can feel shame; it’s the only virtue he’s
got.&nbsp; It’s wonderful how they find out everything that’s
going on—the animals.&nbsp; They—”</p>
<p>“Do you really believe they do, Dorcas?”</p>
<p>“I don’t only just believe it, Marse Tom, I know it.&nbsp;
Day before yesterday they knew something was going to happen.&nbsp;
They were that excited, and whispering around together; why, anybody
could see that they— But my! I must get back to her, and I haven’t
got to my errand yet.”</p>
<p>“What is it, Dorcas?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s two or three things.&nbsp; One is, the doctor
don’t salute when he comes . . . Now, Marse Tom, it ain’t
anything to laugh at, and so—”</p>
<p>“Well, then, forgive me; I didn’t mean to laugh—I
got caught unprepared.”</p>
<p>“You see, she don’t want to hurt the doctor’s feelings,
so she don’t say anything to him about it; but she is always polite,
herself, and it hurts that kind for people to be rude to them.”</p>
<p>“I’ll have that doctor hanged.”</p>
<p>“Marse Tom, she don’t <i>want</i> him hanged.&nbsp; She—”</p>
<p>“Well, then, I’ll have him boiled in oil.”</p>
<p>“But she don’t <i>want</i> him boiled.&nbsp; I—”</p>
<p>“Oh, very well, very well, I only want to please her; I’ll
have him skinned.”</p>
<p>“Why, <i>she</i> don’t want him skinned; it would break
her heart.&nbsp; Now—”</p>
<p>“Woman, this is perfectly unreasonable.&nbsp; What in the nation
<i>does</i> she want?”</p>
<p>“Marse Tom, if you would only be a little patient, and not
fly off the handle at the least little thing.&nbsp; Why, she only wants
you to speak to him.”</p>
<p>“Speak to him!&nbsp; Well, upon my word!&nbsp; All this unseemly
rage and row about such a—a— Dorcas, I never saw you carry
on like this before.&nbsp; You have alarmed the sentry; he thinks I
am being assassinated; he thinks there’s a mutiny, a revolt, an
insurrection; he—”</p>
<p>“Marse Tom, you are just putting on; you know it perfectly
well; I don’t know what makes you act like that—but you
always did, even when you was little, and you can’t get over it,
I reckon.&nbsp; Are you over it now, Marse Tom?”</p>
<p>“Oh, well, yes; but it would try anybody to be doing the best
he could, offering every kindness he could think of, only to have it
rejected with contumely and . . . Oh, well, let it go; it’s no
matter—I’ll talk to the doctor.&nbsp; Is that satisfactory,
or are you going to break out again?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, it is; and it’s only right to talk to him,
too, because it’s just as she says; she’s trying to keep
up discipline in the Rangers, and this insubordination of his is a bad
example for them—now ain’t it so, Marse Tom?”</p>
<p>“Well, there <i>is</i> reason in it, I can’t deny it;
so I will speak to him, though at bottom I think hanging would be more
lasting.&nbsp; What is the rest of your errand, Dorcas?”</p>
<p>“Of course her room is Ranger headquarters now, Marse Tom,
while she’s sick.&nbsp; Well, soldiers of the cavalry and the
dragoons that are off duty come and get her sentries to let them relieve
them and serve in their place.&nbsp; It’s only out of affection,
sir, and because they know military honors please her, and please the
children too, for her sake; and they don’t bring their muskets;
and so—”</p>
<p>“I’ve noticed them there, but didn’t twig the idea.&nbsp;
They are standing guard, are they?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, and she is afraid you will reprove them and hurt
their feelings, if you see them there; so she begs, if—if you
don’t mind coming in the back way—”</p>
<p>“Bear me up, Dorcas; don’t let me faint.”</p>
<p>“There—sit up and behave, Marse Tom.&nbsp; You are not
going to faint; you are only pretending—you used to act just so
when you was little; it does seem a long time for you to get grown up.”</p>
<p>“Dorcas, the way the child is progressing, I shall be out of
my job before long—she’ll have the whole post in her hands.&nbsp;
I must make a stand, I must not go down without a struggle.&nbsp; These
encroachments. . . . Dorcas, what do you think she will think of next?”</p>
<p>“Marse Tom, she don’t mean any harm.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure of it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Marse Tom.”</p>
<p>“You feel sure she has no ulterior designs?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what that is, Marse Tom, but I know she
hasn’t.”</p>
<p>“Very well, then, for the present I am satisfied.&nbsp; What
else have you come about?”</p>
<p>“I reckon I better tell you the whole thing first, Marse Tom,
then tell you what she wants.&nbsp; There’s been an emeute, as
she calls it.&nbsp; It was before she got back with BB.&nbsp; The officer
of the day reported it to her this morning.&nbsp; It happened at her
fort.&nbsp; There was a fuss betwixt Major-General Tommy Drake and Lieutenant-Colonel
Agnes Frisbie, and he snatched her doll away, which is made of white
kid stuffed with sawdust, and tore every rag of its clothes off, right
before them all, and is under arrest, and the charge is conduct un—”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know—conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman—a
plain case, too, it seems to me.&nbsp; This is a serious matter.&nbsp;
Well, what is her pleasure?”</p>
<p>“Well, Marse Tom, she has summoned a court-martial, but the
doctor don’t think she is well enough to preside over it, and
she says there ain’t anybody competent but her, because there’s
a major-general concerned; and so she—she—well, she says,
would you preside over it for her? . . . Marse Tom, <i>sit</i> up!&nbsp;
You ain’t any more going to faint than Shekels is.”</p>
<p>“Look here, Dorcas, go along back, and be tactful.&nbsp; Be
persuasive; don’t fret her; tell her it’s all right, the
matter is in my hands, but it isn’t good form to hurry so grave
a matter as this.&nbsp; Explain to her that we have to go by precedents,
and that I believe this one to be new.&nbsp; In fact, you can say I
know that nothing just like it has happened in our army, therefore I
must be guided by European precedents, and must go cautiously and examine
them carefully.&nbsp; Tell her not to be impatient, it will take me
several days, but it will all come out right, and I will come over and
report progress as I go along.&nbsp; Do you get the idea, Dorcas?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know as I do, sir.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s this.&nbsp; You see, it won’t ever
do for me, a brigadier in the regular army, to preside over that infant
court-martial—there isn’t any precedent for it, don’t
you see.&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; I will go on examining authorities and
reporting progress until she is well enough to get me out of this scrape
by presiding herself.&nbsp; Do you get it now?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, sir, I get it, and it’s good, I’ll go
and fix it with her.&nbsp; <i>Lay down</i>! and stay where you are.”</p>
<p>“Why, what harm is he doing?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it ain’t any harm, but it just vexes me to see him
act so.”</p>
<p>“What was he doing?”</p>
<p>“Can’t you see, and him in such a sweat?&nbsp; He was
starting out to spread it all over the post.&nbsp; <i>Now</i> I reckon
you won’t deny, any more, that they go and tell everything they
hear, now that you’ve seen it with yo’ own eyes.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t like to acknowledge it, Dorcas, but I
don’t see how I can consistently stick to my doubts in the face
of such overwhelming proof as this dog is furnishing.”</p>
<p>“There, now, you’ve got in yo’ right mind at last!&nbsp;
I wonder you can be so stubborn, Marse Tom.&nbsp; But you always was,
even when you was little.&nbsp; I’m going now.”</p>
<p>“Look here; tell her that in view of the delay, it is my judgment
that she ought to enlarge the accused on his parole.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, I’ll tell her.&nbsp; Marse Tom?”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“She can’t get to Soldier Boy, and he stands there all
the time, down in the mouth and lonesome; and she says will you shake
hands with him and comfort him?&nbsp; Everybody does.”</p>
<p>“It’s a curious kind of lonesomeness; but, all right,

<h3>CHAPTER XI—SEVERAL MONTHS LATER.&nbsp; ANTONIO AND THORNDIKE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>“Thorndike, isn’t that Plug you’re riding an assert
of the scrap you and Buffalo Bill had with the late Blake Haskins and
his pal a few months back?”</p>
<p>“Yes, this is Mongrel—and not a half-bad horse, either.”</p>
<p>“I’ve noticed he keeps up his lick first-rate.&nbsp;
Say—isn’t it a gaudy morning?”</p>
<p>“Right you are!”</p>
<p>“Thorndike, it’s Andalusian! and when that’s said,
all’s said.”</p>
<p>“Andalusian <i>and</i> Oregonian, Antonio!&nbsp; Put it that
way, and you have my vote.&nbsp; Being a native up there, I know.&nbsp;
You being Andalusian-born—”</p>
<p>“Can speak with authority for that patch of paradise?&nbsp;
Well, I can.&nbsp; Like the Don! like Sancho!&nbsp; This is the correct
Andalusian dawn now—crisp, fresh, dewy, fragrant, pungent—”</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br></div>
<p>“‘What though the spicy breezes<br>Blow soft o’er
Ceylon’s isle—’</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines1"><br></div>
<p><i>—git</i> up, you old cow! stumbling like that when we’ve
just been praising you! out on a scout and can’t live up to the
honor any better than that?&nbsp; Antonio, how long have you been out
here in the Plains and the Rockies?”</p>
<p>“More than thirteen years.”</p>
<p>“It’s a long time.&nbsp; Don’t you ever get homesick?”</p>
<p>“Not till now.”</p>
<p>“Why <i>now</i>?—after such a long cure.”</p>
<p>“These preparations of the retiring commandant’s have
started it up.”</p>
<p>“Of course.&nbsp; It’s natural.”</p>
<p>“It keeps me thinking about Spain.&nbsp; I know the region
where the Seventh’s child’s aunt lives; I know all the lovely
country for miles around; I’ll bet I’ve seen her aunt’s
villa many a time; I’ll bet I’ve been in it in those pleasant
old times when I was a Spanish gentleman.”</p>
<p>“They say the child is wild to see Spain.”</p>
<p>“It’s so; I know it from what I hear.”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you talked with her about it?”</p>
<p>“No.&nbsp; I’ve avoided it.&nbsp; I should soon be as
wild as she is.&nbsp; That would not be comfortable.”</p>
<p>“I wish I was going, Antonio.&nbsp; There’s two things
I’d give a lot to see.&nbsp; One’s a railroad.”</p>
<p>“She’ll see one when she strikes Missouri.”</p>
<p>“The other’s a bull-fight.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen lots of them; I wish I could see another.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know anything about it, except in a mixed-up,
foggy way, Antonio, but I know enough to know it’s grand sport.”</p>
<p>“The grandest in the world!&nbsp; There’s no other sport
that begins with it.&nbsp; I’ll tell you what I’ve seen,
then you can judge.&nbsp; It was my first, and it’s as vivid to
me now as it was when I saw it.&nbsp; It was a Sunday afternoon, and
beautiful weather, and my uncle, the priest, took me as a reward for
being a good boy and because of my own accord and without anybody asking
me I had bankrupted my savings-box and given the money to a mission
that was civilizing the Chinese and sweetening their lives and softening
their hearts with the gentle teachings of our religion, and I wish you
could have seen what we saw that day, Thorndike.</p>
<p>“The amphitheatre was packed, from the bull-ring to the highest
row—twelve thousand people in one circling mass, one slanting,
solid mass—royalties, nobles, clergy, ladies, gentlemen, state
officials, generals, admirals, soldiers, sailors, lawyers, thieves,
merchants, brokers, cooks, housemaids, scullery-maids, doubtful women,
dudes, gamblers, beggars, loafers, tramps, American ladies, gentlemen,
preachers, English ladies, gentlemen, preachers, German ditto, French
ditto, and so on and so on, all the world represented: Spaniards to
admire and praise, foreigners to enjoy and go home and find fault—there
they were, one solid, sloping, circling sweep of rippling and flashing
color under the downpour of the summer sun—just a garden, a gaudy,
gorgeous flower-garden!&nbsp; Children munching oranges, six thousand
fans fluttering and glimmering, everybody happy, everybody chatting
gayly with their intimates, lovely girl-faces smiling recognition and
salutation to other lovely girl-faces, gray old ladies and gentlemen
dealing in the like exchanges with each other—ah, such a picture
of cheery contentment and glad anticipation! not a mean spirit, nor
a sordid soul, nor a sad heart there—ah, Thorndike, I wish I could
see it again.</p>
<p>“Suddenly, the martial note of a bugle cleaves the hum and
murmur—clear the ring!</p>
<p>“They clear it.&nbsp; The great gate is flung open, and the
procession marches in, splendidly costumed and glittering: the marshals
of the day, then the picadores on horseback, then the matadores on foot,
each surrounded by his quadrille of <i>chulos</i>.&nbsp; They march
to the box of the city fathers, and formally salute.&nbsp; The key is
thrown, the bull-gate is unlocked.&nbsp; Another bugle blast—the
gate flies open, the bull plunges in, furious, trembling, blinking in
the blinding light, and stands there, a magnificent creature, centre
of those multitudinous and admiring eyes, brave, ready for battle, his
attitude a challenge.&nbsp; He sees his enemy: horsemen sitting motionless,
with long spears in rest, upon blindfolded broken-down nags, lean and
starved, fit only for sport and sacrifice, then the carrion-heap.</p>
<p>“The bull makes a rush, with murder in his eye, but a picador
meets him with a spear-thrust in the shoulder.&nbsp; He flinches with
the pain, and the picador skips out of danger.&nbsp; A burst of applause
for the picador, hisses for the bull.&nbsp; Some shout ‘Cow!’
at the bull, and call him offensive names.&nbsp; But he is not listening
to them, he is there for business; he is not minding the cloak-bearers
that come fluttering around to confuse him; he chases this way, he chases
that way, and hither and yon, scattering the nimble banderillos in every
direction like a spray, and receiving their maddening darts in his neck
as they dodge and fly—oh, but it’s a lively spectacle, and
brings down the house!&nbsp; Ah, you should hear the thundering roar
that goes up when the game is at its wildest and brilliant things are
done!</p>
<p>“Oh, that first bull, that day, was great!&nbsp; From the moment
the spirit of war rose to flood-tide in him and he got down to his work,
he began to do wonders.&nbsp; He tore his way through his persecutors,
flinging one of them clear over the parapet; he bowled a horse and his
rider down, and plunged straight for the next, got home with his horns,
wounding both horse and man; on again, here and there and this way and
that; and one after another he tore the bowels out of two horses so
that they gushed to the ground, and ripped a third one so badly that
although they rushed him to cover and shoved his bowels back and stuffed
the rents with tow and rode him against the bull again, he couldn’t
make the trip; he tried to gallop, under the spur, but soon reeled and
tottered and fell, all in a heap.&nbsp; For a while, that bull-ring
was the most thrilling and glorious and inspiring sight that ever was
seen.&nbsp; The bull absolutely cleared it, and stood there alone! monarch
of the place.&nbsp; The people went mad for pride in him, and joy and
delight, and you couldn’t hear yourself think, for the roar and
boom and crash of applause.”</p>
<p>“Antonio, it carries me clear out of myself just to hear you
tell it; it must have been perfectly splendid.&nbsp; If I live, I’ll
see a bull-fight yet before I die.&nbsp; Did they kill him?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes; that is what the bull is for.&nbsp; They tired him
out, and got him at last.&nbsp; He kept rushing the matador, who always
slipped smartly and gracefully aside in time, waiting for a sure chance;
and at last it came; the bull made a deadly plunge for him—was
avoided neatly, and as he sped by, the long sword glided silently into
him, between left shoulder and spine—in and in, to the hilt.&nbsp;
He crumpled down, dying.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Antonio, it <i>is</i> the noblest sport that ever was.&nbsp;
I would give a year of my life to see it.&nbsp; Is the bull always killed?”</p>
<p>“Yes.&nbsp; Sometimes a bull is timid, finding himself in so
strange a place, and he stands trembling, or tries to retreat.&nbsp;
Then everybody despises him for his cowardice and wants him punished
and made ridiculous; so they hough him from behind, and it is the funniest
thing in the world to see him hobbling around on his severed legs; the
whole vast house goes into hurricanes of laughter over it; I have laughed
till the tears ran down my cheeks to see it.&nbsp; When he has furnished
all the sport he can, he is not any longer useful, and is killed.”</p>
<p>“Well, it is perfectly grand, Antonio, perfectly beautiful.&nbsp;
Burning a nigger don’t begin.”</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<h3>CHAPTER XII—MONGREL AND THE OTHER HORSE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>“Sage-Brush, you have been listening?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it strange?”</p>
<p>“Well, no, Mongrel, I don’t know that it is.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a good many human beings in my time.&nbsp;
They are created as they are; they cannot help it.&nbsp; They are only
brutal because that is their make; brutes would be brutal if it was
<i>their</i> make.”</p>
<p>“To me, Sage-Brush, man is most strange and unaccountable.&nbsp;
Why should he treat dumb animals that way when they are not doing any
harm?”</p>
<p>“Man is not always like that, Mongrel; he is kind enough when
he is not excited by religion.”</p>
<p>“Is the bull-fight a religious service?”</p>
<p>“I think so.&nbsp; I have heard so.&nbsp; It is held on Sunday.”</p>
<p>(<i>A reflective pause, lasting some moments</i>.)&nbsp; Then:</p>
<p>“When we die, Sage-Brush, do we go to heaven and dwell with
man?”</p>
<p>“My father thought not.&nbsp; He believed we do not have to
go there unless we deserve it.”</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br><br><br></div>
<h2>PART II—IN SPAIN</h2>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br><br><br></div>
<h3>CHAPTER XIII—GENERAL ALISON TO HIS MOTHER</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>It was a prodigious trip, but delightful, of course, through the
Rockies and the Black Hills and the mighty sweep of the Great Plains
to civilization and the Missouri border—where the railroading
began and the delightfulness ended.&nbsp; But no one is the worse for
the journey; certainly not Cathy, nor Dorcas, nor Soldier Boy; and as
for me, I am not complaining.</p>
<p>Spain is all that Cathy had pictured it—and more, she says.&nbsp;
She is in a fury of delight, the maddest little animal that ever was,
and all for joy.&nbsp; She thinks she remembers Spain, but that is not
very likely, I suppose.&nbsp; The two—Mercedes and Cathy—devour
each other.&nbsp; It is a rapture of love, and beautiful to see.&nbsp;
It is Spanish; that describes it.&nbsp; Will this be a short visit?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; It will be permanent.&nbsp; Cathy has elected to abide
with Spain and her aunt.&nbsp; Dorcas says she (Dorcas) foresaw that
this would happen; and also says that she wanted it to happen, and says
the child’s own country is the right place for her, and that she
ought not to have been sent to me, I ought to have gone to her.&nbsp;
I thought it insane to take Soldier Boy to Spain, but it was well that
I yielded to Cathy’s pleadings; if he had been left behind, half
of her heart would have remained with him, and she would not have been
contented.&nbsp; As it is, everything has fallen out for the best, and
we are all satisfied and comfortable.&nbsp; It may be that Dorcas and
I will see America again some day; but also it is a case of maybe not.</p>
<p>We left the post in the early morning.&nbsp; It was an affecting
time.&nbsp; The women cried over Cathy, so did even those stern warriors,
the Rocky Mountain Rangers; Shekels was there, and the Cid, and Sardanapalus,
and Potter, and Mongrel, and Sour-Mash, Famine, and Pestilence, and
Cathy kissed them all and wept; details of the several arms of the garrison
were present to represent the rest, and say good-bye and God bless you
for all the soldiery; and there was a special squad from the Seventh,
with the oldest veteran at its head, to speed the Seventh’s Child
with grand honors and impressive ceremonies; and the veteran had a touching
speech by heart, and put up his hand in salute and tried to say it,
but his lips trembled and his voice broke, but Cathy bent down from
the saddle and kissed him on the mouth and turned his defeat to victory,
and a cheer went up.</p>
<p>The next act closed the ceremonies, and was a moving surprise.&nbsp;
It may be that you have discovered, before this, that the rigors of
military law and custom melt insensibly away and disappear when a soldier
or a regiment or the garrison wants to do something that will please
Cathy.&nbsp; The bands conceived the idea of stirring her soldierly
heart with a farewell which would remain in her memory always, beautiful
and unfading, and bring back the past and its love for her whenever
she should think of it; so they got their project placed before General
Burnaby, my successor, who is Cathy’s newest slave, and in spite
of poverty of precedents they got his permission.&nbsp; The bands knew
the child’s favorite military airs.&nbsp; By this hint you know
what is coming, but Cathy didn’t.&nbsp; She was asked to sound
the “reveille,” which she did.</p>
<p>[REVEILLE]</p>
<p>With the last note the bands burst out with a crash: and woke the
mountains with the “Star-Spangled Banner” in a way to make
a body’s heart swell and thump and his hair rise!&nbsp; It was
enough to break a person all up, to see Cathy’s radiant face shining
out through her gladness and tears.&nbsp; By request she blew the “assembly,”
now. . . .</p>
<p>[THE ASSEMBLY]</p>
<p>. . . Then the bands thundered in, with “Rally round the flag,
boys, rally once again!”&nbsp; Next, she blew another call (“to
the Standard”) . . .</p>
<p>[TO THE STANDARD]</p>
<p>. . . and the bands responded with “When we were marching through
Georgia.”&nbsp; Straightway she sounded “boots and saddles,”
that thrilling and most expediting call. . . .</p>
<p>[BOOTS AND SADDLES]</p>
<p>and the bands could hardly hold in for the final note; then they
turned their whole strength loose on “Tramp, tramp, tramp, the
boys are marching,” and everybody’s excitement rose to blood-heat.</p>
<p>Now an impressive pause—then the bugle sang “TAPS”—translatable,
this time, into “Good-bye, and God keep us all!” for taps
is the soldier’s nightly release from duty, and farewell: plaintive,
sweet, pathetic, for the morning is never sure, for him; always it is
possible that he is hearing it for the last time. . . .</p>
<p>[TAPS]</p>
<p>. . . Then the bands turned their instruments towards Cathy and burst
in with that rollicking frenzy of a tune, “Oh, we’ll all
get blind drunk when Johnny comes marching home—yes, we’ll
all get blind drunk when Johnny comes marching home!” and followed
it instantly with “Dixie,” that antidote for melancholy,
merriest and gladdest of all military music on any side of the ocean—and
that was the end.&nbsp; And so—farewell!</p>
<p>I wish you could have been there to see it all, hear it all, and
feel it: and get yourself blown away with the hurricane huzza that swept
the place as a finish.</p>
<p>When we rode away, our main body had already been on the road an
hour or two—I speak of our camp equipage; but we didn’t
move off alone: when Cathy blew the “advance” the Rangers
cantered out in column of fours, and gave us escort, and were joined
by White Cloud and Thunder-Bird in all their gaudy bravery, and by Buffalo
Bill and four subordinate scouts.&nbsp; Three miles away, in the Plains,
the Lieutenant-General halted, sat her horse like a military statue,
the bugle at her lips, and put the Rangers through the evolutions for
half an hour; and finally, when she blew the “charge,” she
led it herself.&nbsp; “Not for the last time,” she said,
and got a cheer, and we said good-bye all around, and faced eastward
and rode away.</p>
<p><i>Postscript.&nbsp; A Day Later</i>.&nbsp; Soldier Boy was stolen
last night.&nbsp; Cathy is almost beside herself, and we cannot comfort
her.&nbsp; Mercedes and I are not much alarmed about the horse, although
this part of Spain is in something of a turmoil, politically, at present,
and there is a good deal of lawlessness.&nbsp; In ordinary times the
thief and the horse would soon be captured.&nbsp; We shall have them
before long, I think.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<h3>CHAPTER XIV—SOLDIER BOY—TO HIMSELF</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>It is five months.&nbsp; Or is it six?&nbsp; My troubles have clouded
my memory.&nbsp; I have been all over this land, from end to end, and
now I am back again since day before yesterday, to that city which we
passed through, that last day of our long journey, and which is near
her country home.&nbsp; I am a tottering ruin and my eyes are dim, but
I recognized it.&nbsp; If she could see me she would know me and sound
my call.&nbsp; I wish I could hear it once more; it would revive me,
it would bring back her face and the mountains and the free life, and
I would come—if I were dying I would come!&nbsp; She would not
know <i>me</i>, looking as I do, but she would know me by my star.&nbsp;
But she will never see me, for they do not let me out of this shabby
stable—a foul and miserable place, with most two wrecks like myself
for company.</p>
<p>How many times have I changed hands?&nbsp; I think it is twelve times—I
cannot remember; and each time it was down a step lower, and each time
I got a harder master.&nbsp; They have been cruel, every one; they have
worked me night and day in degraded employments, and beaten me; they
have fed me ill, and some days not at all.&nbsp; And so I am but bones,
now, with a rough and frowsy skin humped and cornered upon my shrunken
body—that skin which was once so glossy, that skin which she loved
to stroke with her hand.&nbsp; I was the pride of the mountains and
the Great Plains; now I am a scarecrow and despised.&nbsp; These piteous
wrecks that are my comrades here say we have reached the bottom of the
scale, the final humiliation; they say that when a horse is no longer
worth the weeds and discarded rubbish they feed to him, they sell him
to the bull-ring for a glass of brandy, to make sport for the people
and perish for their pleasure.</p>
<p>To die—that does not disturb me; we of the service never care
for death.&nbsp; But if I could see her once more! if I could hear her
bugle sing again and say, “It is I, Soldier—come!”</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<h3>CHAPTER XV—GENERAL ALISON TO MRS. DRAKE, THE COLONEL’S
WIFE</h3>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br><br></div>
<p>To return, now, to where I was, and tell you the rest.&nbsp; We shall
never know how she came to be there; there is no way to account for
it.&nbsp; She was always watching for black and shiny and spirited horses—watching,
hoping, despairing, hoping again; always giving chase and sounding her
call, upon the meagrest chance of a response, and breaking her heart
over the disappointment; always inquiring, always interested in sales-stables
and horse accumulations in general.&nbsp; How she got there must remain
a mystery.</p>
<p>At the point which I had reached in a preceding paragraph of this
account, the situation was as follows: two horses lay dying; the bull
had scattered his persecutors for the moment, and stood raging, panting,
pawing the dust in clouds over his back, when the man that had been
wounded returned to the ring on a remount, a poor blindfolded wreck
that yet had something ironically military about his bearing—and
the next moment the bull had ripped him open and his bowls were dragging
upon the ground: and the bull was charging his swarm of pests again.&nbsp;
Then came pealing through the air a bugle-call that froze my blood—“<i>It
is I, Soldier—come</i>!”&nbsp; I turned; Cathy was flying
down through the massed people; she cleared the parapet at a bound,
and sped towards that riderless horse, who staggered forward towards
the remembered sound; but his strength failed, and he fell at her feet,
she lavishing kisses upon him and sobbing, the house rising with one
impulse, and white with horror!&nbsp; Before help could reach her the
bull was back again—</p>
<p>She was never conscious again in life.&nbsp; We bore her home, all
mangled and drenched in blood, and knelt by her and listened to her
broken and wandering words, and prayed for her passing spirit, and there
was no comfort—nor ever will be, I think.&nbsp; But she was happy,
for she was far away under another sky, and comrading again with her
Rangers, and her animal friends, and the soldiers.&nbsp; Their names
fell softly and caressingly from her lips, one by one, with pauses between.&nbsp;
She was not in pain, but lay with closed eyes, vacantly murmuring, as
one who dreams.&nbsp; Sometimes she smiled, saying nothing; sometimes
she smiled when she uttered a name—such as Shekels, or BB, or
Potter.&nbsp; Sometimes she was at her fort, issuing commands; sometimes
she was careering over the plain at the head of her men; sometimes she
was training her horse; once she said, reprovingly, “You are giving
me the wrong foot; give me the left—don’t you know it is
good-bye?”</p>
<p>After this, she lay silent some time; the end was near.&nbsp; By-and-by
she murmured, “Tired . . . sleepy . . . take Cathy, mamma.”&nbsp;
Then, “Kiss me, Soldier.”&nbsp; For a little time, she lay
so still that we were doubtful if she breathed.&nbsp; Then she put out
her hand and began to feel gropingly about; then said, “I cannot
find it; blow ‘taps.’”&nbsp; It was the end.</p>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
