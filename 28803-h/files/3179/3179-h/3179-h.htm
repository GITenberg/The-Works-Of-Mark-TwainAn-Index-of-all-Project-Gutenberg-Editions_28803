      The Colonel Mulberry Sellers here re-introduced to the public is the same
      person who appeared as Eschol Sellers in the first edition of the tale
      entitled "The Gilded Age," years ago, and as Beriah Sellers in the
      subsequent editions of the same book, and finally as Mulberry Sellers in
      the drama played afterward by John T. Raymond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name was changed from Eschol to Beriah to accommodate an Eschol
      Sellers who rose up out of the vasty deeps of uncharted space and
      preferred his request&mdash;backed by threat of a libel suit&mdash;then
      went his way appeased, and came no more. In the play Beriah had to be
      dropped to satisfy another member of the race, and Mulberry was
      substituted in the hope that the objectors would be tired by that time and
      let it pass unchallenged. So far it has occupied the field in peace;
      therefore we chance it again, feeling reasonably safe, this time, under
      shelter of the statute of limitations.

      THE WEATHER IN THIS BOOK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      No weather will be found in this book. This is an attempt to pull a book
      through without weather. It being the first attempt of the kind in
      fictitious literature, it may prove a failure, but it seemed worth the
      while of some dare-devil person to try it, and the author was in just the
      mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many a reader who wanted to read a tale through was not able to do it
      because of delays on account of the weather. Nothing breaks up an author's
      progress like having to stop every few pages to fuss-up the weather. Thus
      it is plain that persistent intrusions of weather are bad for both reader
      and author.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course weather is necessary to a narrative of human experience. That is
      conceded. But it ought to be put where it will not be in the way; where it
      will not interrupt the flow of the narrative. And it ought to be the
      ablest weather that can be had, not ignorant, poor-quality, amateur
      weather. Weather is a literary specialty, and no untrained hand can turn
      out a good article of it. The present author can do only a few trifling
      ordinary kinds of weather, and he cannot do those very good. So it has
      seemed wisest to borrow such weather as is necessary for the book from
      qualified and recognized experts&mdash;giving credit, of course. This
      weather will be found over in the back part of the book, out of the way.
      See Appendix. The reader is requested to turn over and help himself from
      time to time as he goes along.

      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a matchless morning in rural England. On a fair hill we see a
      majestic pile, the ivied walls and towers of Cholmondeley Castle, huge
      relic and witness of the baronial grandeurs of the Middle Ages. This is
      one of the seats of the Earl of Rossmore, K. G. G. C. B. K. C. M. G.,
      etc., etc., etc., etc., etc., who possesses twenty-two thousand acres of
      English land, owns a parish in London with two thousand houses on its
      lease-roll, and struggles comfortably along on an income of two hundred
      thousand pounds a year. The father and founder of this proud old line was
      William the Conqueror his very self; the mother of it was not inventoried
      in history by name, she being merely a random episode and inconsequential,
      like the tanner's daughter of Falaise.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a breakfast room of the castle on this breezy fine morning there are
      two persons and the cooling remains of a deserted meal. One of these
      persons is the old lord, tall, erect, square-shouldered, white-haired,
      stern-browed, a man who shows character in every feature, attitude, and
      movement, and carries his seventy years as easily as most men carry fifty.
      The other person is his only son and heir, a dreamy-eyed young fellow, who
      looks about twenty-six but is nearer thirty. Candor, kindliness, honesty,
      sincerity, simplicity, modesty&mdash;it is easy to see that these are
      cardinal traits of his character; and so when you have clothed him in the
      formidable components of his name, you somehow seem to be contemplating a
      lamb in armor: his name and style being the Honourable Kirkcudbright
      Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount-Berkeley, of Cholmondeley Castle,
      Warwickshire. (Pronounced K'koobry Thlanover Marshbanks Sellers Vycount
      Barkly, of Chumly Castle, Warrikshr.) He is standing by a great window, in
      an attitude suggestive of respectful attention to what his father is
      saying and equally respectful dissent from the positions and arguments
      offered. The father walks the floor as he talks, and his talk shows that
      his temper is away up toward summer heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soft-spirited as you are, Berkeley, I am quite aware that when you have
      once made up your mind to do a thing which your ideas of honor and justice
      require you to do, argument and reason are (for the time being,) wasted
      upon you&mdash;yes, and ridicule; persuasion, supplication, and command as
      well. To my mind&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, if you will look at it without prejudice, without passion, you
      must concede that I am not doing a rash thing, a thoughtless, wilful
      thing, with nothing substantial behind it to justify it. I did not create
      the American claimant to the earldom of Rossmore; I did not hunt for him,
      did not find him, did not obtrude him upon your notice. He found himself,
      he injected himself into our lives&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And has made mine a purgatory for ten years with his tiresome letters,
      his wordy reasonings, his acres of tedious evidence,&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which you would never read, would never consent to read. Yet in common
      fairness he was entitled to a hearing. That hearing would either prove he
      was the rightful earl&mdash;in which case our course would be plain&mdash;or
      it would prove that he wasn't&mdash;in which case our course would be
      equally plain. I have read his evidences, my lord. I have conned them
      well, studied them patiently and thoroughly. The chain seems to be
      complete, no important link wanting. I believe he is the rightful earl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I a usurper&mdash;a&mdash;nameless pauper, a tramp! Consider what you
      are saying, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, if he is the rightful earl, would you, could you&mdash;that fact
      being established&mdash;consent to keep his titles and his properties from
      him a day, an hour, a minute?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are talking nonsense&mdash;nonsense&mdash;lurid idiocy! Now, listen
      to me. I will make a confession&mdash;if you wish to call it by that name.
      I did not read those evidences because I had no occasion to&mdash;I was
      made familiar with them in the time of this claimant's father and of my
      own father forty years ago. This fellow's predecessors have kept mine more
      or less familiar with them for close upon a hundred and fifty years. The
      truth is, the rightful heir did go to America, with the Fairfax heir or
      about the same time&mdash;but disappeared&mdash;somewhere in the wilds of
      Virginia, got married, and began to breed savages for the Claimant market;
      wrote no letters home; was supposed to be dead; his younger brother softly
      took possession; presently the American did die, and straightway his
      eldest product put in his claim&mdash;by letter&mdash;letter still in
      existence&mdash;and died before the uncle in-possession found time&mdash;or
      maybe inclination&mdash;to&mdash;answer. The infant son of that eldest
      product grew up&mdash;long interval, you see&mdash;and he took to writing
      letters and furnishing evidences. Well, successor after successor has done
      the same, down to the present idiot. It was a succession of paupers; not
      one of them was ever able to pay his passage to England or institute suit.
      The Fairfaxes kept their lordship alive, and so they have never lost it to
      this day, although they live in Maryland; their friend lost his by his own
      neglect. You perceive now, that the facts in this case bring us to
      precisely this result: morally the American tramp is rightful earl of
      Rossmore; legally he has no more right than his dog. There now&mdash;are
      you satisfied?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, then the son glanced at the crest carved in the great
      oaken mantel and said, with a regretful note in his voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since the introduction of heraldic symbols,&mdash;the motto of this house
      has been 'Suum cuique'&mdash;to every man his own. By your own intrepidly
      frank confession, my lord, it is become a sarcasm: If Simon Lathers&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep that exasperating name to yourself! For ten years it has pestered my
      eye&mdash;and tortured my ear; till at last my very footfalls time
      themselves to the brain-racking rhythm of Simon Lathers!&mdash;Simon
      Lathers! &mdash;Simon Lathers! And now, to make its presence in my soul
      eternal, immortal, imperishable, you have resolved to&mdash;to&mdash;what
      is it you have resolved to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To go to Simon Lathers, in America, and change places with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Deliver the reversion of the earldom into his hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make this tremendous surrender without even trying the fantastic case in
      the Lords?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ye&mdash;s&mdash;" with hesitation and some embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By all that is amazing, I believe you are insane, my son. See here
      &mdash;have you been training with that ass again&mdash;that radical, if
      you prefer the term, though the words are synonymous&mdash;Lord Tanzy, of
      Tollmache?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The son did not reply, and the old lord continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you confess. That puppy, that shame to his birth and caste, who
      holds all hereditary lordships and privilege to be usurpation, all
      nobility a tinsel sham, all aristocratic institutions a fraud, all
      inequalities in rank a legalized crime and an infamy, and no bread honest
      bread that a man doesn't earn by his own work&mdash;work, pah!"&mdash;and
      the old patrician brushed imaginary labor-dirt from his white hands. "You
      have come to hold just those opinions yourself, suppose,"&mdash;he added
      with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint flush in the younger man's cheek told that the shot had hit and
      hurt; but he answered with dignity:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have. I say it without shame&mdash;I feel none. And now my reason for
      resolving to renounce my heirship without resistance is explained. I wish
      to retire from what to me is a false existence, a false position, and
      begin my life over again&mdash;begin it right&mdash;begin it on the level
      of mere manhood, unassisted by factitious aids, and succeed or fail by
      pure merit or the want of it. I will go to America, where all men are
      equal and all have an equal chance; I will live or die, sink or swim, win
      or lose as just a man&mdash;that alone, and not a single helping gaud or
      fiction back of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear, hear!" The two men looked each other steadily in the eye a moment
      or two, then the elder one added, musingly, "Ab-so-lutely
      cra-zy-ab-solutely!" After another silence, he said, as one who, long
      troubled by clouds, detects a ray of sunshine, "Well, there will be one
      satisfaction&mdash;Simon Lathers will come here to enter into his own, and
      I will drown him in the horsepond. The poor devil&mdash;always so humble
      in his letters, so pitiful, so deferential; so steeped in reverence for
      our great line and lofty-station; so anxious to placate us, so prayerful
      for recognition as a relative, a bearer in his veins of our sacred blood&mdash;and
      withal so poor, so needy, so threadbare and pauper-shod as to raiment, so
      despised, so laughed at for his silly claimantship by the lewd American
      scum around him&mdash;ah, the vulgar, crawling, insufferable tramp! To
      read one of his cringing, nauseating letters&mdash;well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This to a splendid flunkey, all in inflamed plush and buttons and
      knee-breeches as to his trunk, and a glinting white frost-work of
      ground-glass paste as to his head, who stood with his heels together and
      the upper half of him bent forward, a salver in his hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The letters, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      My lord took them, and the servant disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Among the rest, an American letter. From the tramp, of course. Jove, but
      here's a change! No brown paper envelope this time, filched from a shop,
      and carrying the shop's advertisement in the corner. Oh, no, a proper
      enough envelope&mdash;with a most ostentatiously broad mourning border&mdash;for
      his cat, perhaps, since he was a bachelor&mdash;and fastened with red wax&mdash;a
      batch of it as big as a half-crown&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;our crest for
      a seal!&mdash;motto and all. And the ignorant, sprawling hand is gone; he
      sports a secretary, evidently&mdash;a secretary with a most confident
      swing and flourish to his pen. Oh indeed, our fortunes are improving over
      there&mdash;our meek tramp has undergone a metamorphosis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read it, my lord, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, this time I will. For the sake of the cat:"

        <br /> <br /> 14,042 SIXTEENTH. STREET, <br /> WASHINGTON, May 2. <br />
        <br />My Lord&mdash; <br /> It is my painful duty to announce to you that
        the head of our illustrious house is no more&mdash;The Right Honourable,
        The Most Noble, The Most Puissant Simon Lathers Lord Rossmore having
        departed this life ("Gone at last&mdash;this is unspeakably precious
        news, my son,") at his seat in the environs of the hamlet of Duffy's
        Corners in the grand old State of Arkansas,&mdash;and his twin brother
        with him, both being crushed by a log at a smoke-house-raising, owing to
        carelessness on the part of all present, referable to over-confidence
        and gaiety induced by overplus of sour-mash&mdash;("Extolled be
        sour-mash, whatever that may be, eh Berkeley?") five days ago, with no
        scion of our ancient race present to close his eyes and inter him with
        the honors due his historic name and lofty rank&mdash;in fact, he is on
        the ice yet, him and his brother&mdash;friends took up a collection for
        it. But I shall take immediate occasion to have their noble remains
        shipped to you ("Great heavens!") for interment, with due ceremonies and
        solemnities, in the family vault or mausoleum of our house. Meantime I
        shall put up a pair of hatchments on my house-front, and you will of
        course do the same at your several seats. <br /><br /> I have also to
        remind you that by this sad disaster I as sole heir, inherit and become
        seized of all the titles, honors, lands, and goods of our lamented
        relative, and must of necessity, painful as the duty is, shortly require
        at the bar of the Lords restitution of these dignities and properties,
        now illegally enjoyed by your titular lordship. <br /><br /> With
        assurance of my distinguished consideration and warm cousinly regard, I
        remain <br /> Your titular lordship's <br /><br /> <br /> Most obedient
        servant, <br /> Mulberry Sellers Earl Rossmore. <br />

      "Im-mense! Come, this one's interesting. Why, Berkeley, his breezy
      impudence is&mdash;is&mdash;why, it's colossal, it's sublime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, this one doesn't seem to cringe much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cringe&mdash;why, he doesn't know the meaning of the word. Hatchments! To
      commemorate that sniveling tramp and his, fraternal duplicate. And he is
      going to send me the remains. The late Claimant was a fool, but plainly
      this new one's a maniac. What a name! Mulberry Sellers&mdash;there's music
      for you, Simon Lathers&mdash;Mulberry Sellers&mdash;Mulberry Sellers&mdash;Simon

      The old gentleman stood musing some time, after his son was gone. This was
      his thought:

    <p>
      "He is a good boy, and lovable. Let him take his own course&mdash;as it
      would profit nothing to oppose him&mdash;make things worse, in fact. My
      arguments and his aunt's persuasions have failed; let us see what America
      can do for us. Let us see what equality and hard-times can effect for the
      mental health of a brain-sick young British lord. Going to renounce his
      lordship and be a man! Yas!"

    <p>
      COLONEL MULBERRY SELLERS&mdash;this was some days before he wrote his
      letter to Lord Rossmore&mdash;was seated in his "library," which was also
      his "drawing-room" and was also his "picture gallery" and likewise his
      "work-shop." Sometimes he called it by one of these names, sometimes by
      another, according to occasion and circumstance. He was constructing what
      seemed to be some kind of a frail mechanical toy; and was apparently very
      much interested in his work. He was a white-headed man, now, but otherwise
      he was as young, alert, buoyant, visionary and enterprising as ever. His
      loving old wife sat near by, contentedly knitting and thinking, with a cat
      asleep in her lap. The room was large, light, and had a comfortable look,
      in fact a home-like look, though the furniture was of a humble sort and
      not over abundant, and the knickknacks and things that go to adorn a
      living-room not plenty and not costly. But there were natural flowers, and
      there was an abstract and unclassifiable something about the place which
      betrayed the presence in the house of somebody with a happy taste and an
      effective touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the deadly chromos on the walls were somehow without offence; in fact
      they seemed to belong there and to add an attraction to the room&mdash;a
      fascination, anyway; for whoever got his eye on one of them was like to
      gaze and suffer till he died&mdash;you have seen that kind of pictures.
      Some of these terrors were landscapes, some libeled the sea, some were
      ostensible portraits, all were crimes. All the portraits were recognizable
      as dead Americans of distinction, and yet, through labeling added, by a
      daring hand, they were all doing duty here as "Earls of Rossmore." The
      newest one had left the works as Andrew Jackson, but was doing its best
      now, as "Simon Lathers Lord Rossmore, Present Earl." On one wall was a
      cheap old railroad map of Warwickshire. This had been newly labeled "The
      Rossmore Estates." On the opposite wall was another map, and this was the
      most imposing decoration of the establishment and the first to catch a
      stranger's attention, because of its great size. It had once borne simply
      the title SIBERIA; but now the word "FUTURE" had been written in front of
      that word. There were other additions, in red ink&mdash;many cities, with
      great populations set down, scattered over the vast-country at points
      where neither cities nor populations exist to-day. One of these cities,
      with population placed at 1,500,000, bore the name
      "Libertyorloffskoizalinski," and there was a still more populous one,
      centrally located and marked "Capital," which bore the name
      "Freedomolovnaivanovich."
    </p>
    <p>
      The "mansion"&mdash;the Colonel's usual name for the house&mdash;was a
      rickety old two-story frame of considerable size, which had been painted,
      some time or other, but had nearly forgotten it. It was away out in the
      ragged edge of Washington and had once been somebody's country place. It
      had a neglected yard around it, with paling fence that needed
      straightening up, in places, and a gate that would stay shut. By the
      door-post were several modest tin signs. "Col. Mulberry Sellers, Attorney
      at Law and Claim Agent," was the principal one. One learned from the
      others that the Colonel was a Materializer, a Hypnotizer, a Mind-Cure
      dabbler; and so on. For he was a man who could always find things to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      A white-headed negro man, with spectacles and damaged white cotton gloves
      appeared in the presence, made a stately obeisance and announced:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marse Washington Hawkins, suh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great Scott! Show him in, Dan'l, show him in."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel and his wife were on their feet in a moment, and the next
      moment were joyfully wringing the hands of a stoutish, discouraged-looking
      man whose general aspect suggested that he was fifty years old, but whose
      hair swore to a hundred.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, well, Washington, my boy, it is good to look at you again.
      Sit down, sit down, and make yourself at home. There, now&mdash;why, you
      look perfectly natural; aging a little, just a little, but you'd have
      known him anywhere, wouldn't you, Polly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, Berry, he's just like his pa would have looked if he'd lived.
      Dear, dear, where have you dropped from? Let me see, how long is it since&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say it's all of fifteen years, Mrs. Sellers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, how time does get away with us. Yes, and oh, the changes that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden catch of her voice and a trembling of the lip, the men
      waiting reverently for her to get command of herself and go on; but after
      a little struggle she turned away, with her apron to her eyes, and softly
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seeing you made her think of the children, poor thing&mdash;dear, dear,
      they're all dead but the youngest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But banish care, it's no time for it now&mdash;on with the dance, let joy
      be unconfined is my motto, whether there's any dance to dance; or any joy
      to unconfine&mdash;you'll be the healthier for it every time,&mdash;every
      time, Washington&mdash;it's my experience, and I've seen a good deal of
      this world. Come&mdash;where have you disappeared to all these years, and
      are you from there, now, or where are you from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite think you would ever guess, Colonel. Cherokee Strip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My land!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure as you live."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't mean it. Actually living out there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes, if a body may call it that; though it's a pretty strong term
      for 'dobies and jackass rabbits, boiled beans and slap-jacks, depression,
      withered hopes, poverty in all its varieties&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Louise out there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and the children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out there now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I couldn't afford to bring them with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see,&mdash;you had to come&mdash;claim against the government. Make
      yourself perfectly easy&mdash;I'll take care of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it isn't a claim against the government."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No? Want to be postmaster? That's all right. Leave it to me. I'll fix
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it isn't postmaster&mdash;you're all astray yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, good gracious, Washington, why don't you come out and tell me what
      it is? What, do you want to be so reserved and distrustful with an old
      friend like me for? Don't you reckon I can keep a se&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no secret about it&mdash;you merely don't give me a chance to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now look here, old friend, I know the human race; and I know that when a
      man comes to Washington, I don't care if it's from heaven, let alone
      Cherokee-Strip, it's because he wants something. And I know that as a rule
      he's not going to get it; that he'll stay and try&mdash;for another thing
      and won't get that; the same luck with the next and the next and the next;
      and keeps on till he strikes bottom, and is too poor and ashamed to go
      back, even to Cherokee Strip; and at last his heart breaks&mdash;and they
      take up a collection and bury him. There&mdash;don't interrupt me, I know
      what I'm talking about. Happy and prosperous in the Far West wasn't I? You
      know that. Principal citizen of Hawkeye, looked up to by everybody, kind
      of an autocrat, actually a kind of an autocrat, Washington. Well, nothing
      would do but I must go Minister to St. James, the Governor and everybody
      insisting, you know, and so at last I consented&mdash;no getting out of
      it, had to do it, so here I came. A day too late, Washington. Think of
      that&mdash;what little things change the world's history&mdash;yes, sir,
      the place had been filled. Well, there I was, you see. I offered to
      compromise and go to Paris. The President was very sorry and all that, but
      that place, you see, didn't belong to the West, so there I was again.
      There was no help for it, so I had to stoop a little&mdash;we all reach
      the day some time or other when we've got to do that, Washington, and it's
      not a bad thing for us, either, take it by and large and all around&mdash;I
      had to stoop a little and offer to take Constantinople. Washington,
      consider this&mdash;for it's perfectly true&mdash;within a month I asked
      for China; within another month I begged for Japan; one year later I was
      away down, down, down, supplicating with tears and anguish for the bottom
      office in the gift of the government of the United States&mdash;Flint-Picker
      in the cellars of the War Department. And by George I didn't get it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Flint-Picker?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Office established in the time of the Revolution, last century. The
      musket-flints for the military posts were supplied from the capitol. They
      do it yet; for although the flint-arm has gone out and the forts have
      tumbled down, the decree hasn't been repealed&mdash;been overlooked and
      forgotten, you see&mdash;and so the vacancies where old Ticonderoga and
      others used to stand, still get their six quarts of gun-flints a year just
      the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington said musingly after a pause:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How strange it seems&mdash;to start for Minister to England at twenty
      thousand a year and fail for flintpicker at&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three dollars a week. It's human life, Washington&mdash;just an epitome
      of human ambition, and struggle, and the outcome: you aim for the palace
      and get drowned in the sewer."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another meditative silence. Then Washington said, with earnest
      compassion in his voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so, after coming here, against your inclination, to satisfy your
      sense of patriotic duty and appease a selfish public clamor, you get
      absolutely nothing for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing?" The Colonel had to get up and stand, to get room for his
      amazement to expand. "Nothing, Washington? I ask you this: to be a
      perpetual Member and the only Perpetual Member of a Diplomatic Body
      accredited to the greatest country on earth do you call that nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Washington's turn to be amazed. He was stricken dumb; but the
      wide-eyed wonder, the reverent admiration expressed in his face were more
      eloquent than any words could have been. The Colonel's wounded spirit was
      healed and he resumed his seat pleased and content. He leaned forward and
      said impressively:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was due to a man who had become forever conspicuous by an experience
      without precedent in the history of the world?&mdash;a man made
      permanently and diplomatically sacred, so to speak, by having been
      connected, temporarily, through solicitation, with every single diplomatic
      post in the roster of this government, from Envoy Extraordinary and
      Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of St. James all the way down to
      Consul to a guano rock in the Strait of Sunda&mdash;salary payable in
      guano&mdash;which disappeared by volcanic convulsion the day before they
      got down to my name in the list of applicants. Certainly something august
      enough to be answerable to the size of this unique and memorable
      experience was my due, and I got it. By the common voice of this
      community, by acclamation of the people, that mighty utterance which
      brushes aside laws and legislation, and from whose decrees there is no
      appeal, I was named Perpetual Member of the Diplomatic Body representing
      the multifarious sovereignties and civilizations of the globe near the
      republican court of the United States of America. And they brought me home
      with a torchlight procession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is wonderful, Colonel, simply wonderful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the loftiest official position in the whole earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so&mdash;and the most commanding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have named the word. Think of it. I frown, and there is war; I smile,
      and contending nations lay down their arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is awful. The responsibility, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is nothing. Responsibility is no burden to me; I am used to it; have
      always been used to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the work&mdash;the work! Do you have to attend all the sittings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, I? Does the Emperor of Russia attend the conclaves of the governors
      of the provinces? He sits at home, and indicates his pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington was silent a moment, then a deep sigh escaped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How proud I was an hour ago; how paltry seems my little promotion now!
      Colonel, the reason I came to Washington is,&mdash;I am Congressional
      Delegate from Cherokee Strip!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel sprang to his feet and broke out with prodigious enthusiasm:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me your hand, my boy&mdash;this is immense news! I congratulate you
      with all my heart. My prophecies stand confirmed. I always said it was in
      you. I always said you were born for high distinction and would achieve
      it. You ask Polly if I didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington was dazed by this most unexpected demonstration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Colonel, there's nothing to it. That little narrow, desolate,
      unpeopled, oblong streak of grass and gravel, lost in the remote wastes of
      the vast continent&mdash;why, it's like representing a billiard table&mdash;a
      discarded one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tut-tut, it's a great, it's a staving preferment, and just opulent with
      influence here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shucks, Colonel, I haven't even a vote."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's nothing; you can make speeches."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I can't. The population's only two hundred&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, that's all right&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they hadn't any right to elect me; we're not even a territory,
      there's no Organic Act, the government hasn't any official knowledge of us
      whatever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind about that; I'll fix that. I'll rush the thing through, I'll
      get you organized in no time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you, Colonel?&mdash;it's too good of you; but it's just your old
      sterling self, the same old ever-faithful friend," and the grateful tears
      welled up in Washington's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just as good as done, my boy, just as good as done. Shake hands.
      We'll hitch teams together, you and I, and we'll make things hum!"

    <p>
      Mrs. Sellers returned, now, with her composure restored, and began to ask
      after Hawkins's wife, and about his children, and the number of them, and
      so on, and her examination of the witness resulted in a circumstantial
      history of the family's ups and downs and driftings to and fro in the far
      West during the previous fifteen years. There was a message, now, from out
      back, and Colonel Sellers went out there in answer to it. Hawkins took
      this opportunity to ask how the world had been using the Colonel during
      the past half-generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's been using him just the same; it couldn't change its way of
      using him if it wanted to, for he wouldn't let it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can easily believe that, Mrs. Sellers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you see, he doesn't change, himself&mdash;not the least little bit
      in the world&mdash;he's always Mulberry Sellers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can see that plain enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just the same old scheming, generous, good-hearted, moonshiny, hopeful,
      no-account failure he always was, and still everybody likes him just as
      well as if he was the shiningest success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They always did: and it was natural, because he was so obliging and
      accommodating, and had something about him that made it kind of easy to
      ask help of him, or favors&mdash;you didn't feel shy, you know, or have
      that wish&mdash;you&mdash;didn't&mdash;have&mdash;to&mdash;try feeling
      that you have with other people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just so, yet; and a body wonders at it, too, because he's been
      shamefully treated, many times, by people that had used him for a ladder
      to climb up by, and then kicked him down when they didn't need him any
      more. For a time you can see he's hurt, his pride's wounded, because he
      shrinks away from that thing and don't want to talk about it&mdash;and so
      I used to think now he's learned something and he'll be more careful
      hereafter&mdash;but laws! in a couple of weeks he's forgotten all about
      it, and any selfish tramp out of nobody knows where can come and put up a
      poor mouth and walk right into his heart with his boots on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must try your patience pretty sharply sometimes."

    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, I'm used to it; and I'd rather have him so than the other way.
      When I call him a failure, I mean to the world he's a failure; he isn't to
      me. I don't know as I want him different much different, anyway. I have to
      scold him some, snarl at him, you might even call it, but I reckon I'd do
      that just the same, if he was different&mdash;it's my make. But I'm a good
      deal less snarly and more contented when he's a failure than I am when he
      isn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he isn't always a failure," said Hawking, brightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him? Oh, bless you, no. He makes a strike, as he calls it, from time to
      time. Then's my time to fret and fuss. For the money just flies&mdash;first
      come first served. Straight off, he loads up the house with cripples and
      idiots and stray cats and all the different kinds of poor wrecks that
      other people don't want and he does, and then when the poverty comes again
      I've got to clear the most of them out or we'd starve; and that distresses
      him, and me the same, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's old Dan'l and old Jinny, that the sheriff sold south one of the
      times that we got bankrupted before the war&mdash;they came wandering back
      after the peace, worn out and used up on the cotton plantations, helpless,
      and not another lick of work left in their old hides for the rest of this
      earthly pilgrimage&mdash;and we so pinched, oh so pinched for the very
      crumbs to keep life in us, and he just flung the door wide, and the way he
      received them you'd have thought they had come straight down from heaven
      in answer to prayer. I took him one side and said, 'Mulberry we can't have
      them&mdash;we've nothing for ourselves&mdash;we can't feed them.' He
      looked at me kind of hurt, and said, 'Turn them out?&mdash;and they've
      come to me just as confident and trusting as&mdash;as&mdash;why Polly, I
      must have bought that confidence sometime or other a long time ago, and
      given my note, so to speak&mdash;you don't get such things as a gift&mdash;and
      how am I going to go back on a debt like that? And you see, they're so
      poor, and old, and friendless, and&mdash;' But I was ashamed by that time,
      and shut him off, and somehow felt a new courage in me, and so I said,
      softly, 'We'll keep them&mdash;the Lord will provide.' He was glad, and
      started to blurt out one of those over-confident speeches of his, but
      checked himself in time, and said humbly, 'I will, anyway.' It was years
      and years and years ago. Well, you see those old wrecks are here yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But don't they do your housework?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Laws! The idea. They would if they could, poor old things, and perhaps
      they think they do do some of it. But it's a superstition. Dan'l waits on
      the front door, and sometimes goes on an errand; and sometimes you'll see
      one or both of them letting on to dust around in here&mdash;but that's
      because there's something they want to hear about and mix their gabble
      into. And they're always around at meals, for the same reason. But the
      fact is, we have to keep a young negro girl just to take care of them, and
      a negro woman to do the housework and help take care of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, they ought to be tolerably happy, I should think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no name for it. They quarrel together pretty much all the time&mdash;most
      always about religion, because Dan'l's a Dunker Baptist and Jinny's a
      shouting Methodist, and Jinny believes in special Providences and Dan'l
      don't, because he thinks he's a kind of a free-thinker&mdash;and they play
      and sing plantation hymns together, and talk and chatter just eternally
      and forever, and are sincerely fond of each other and think the world of
      Mulberry, and he puts up patiently with all their spoiled ways and
      foolishness, and so&mdash;ah, well, they're happy enough if it comes to
      that. And I don't mind&mdash;I've got used to it. I can get used to
      anything, with Mulberry to help; and the fact is, I don't much care what
      happens, so long as he's spared to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, here's to him, and hoping he'll make another strike soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And rake in the lame, the halt and the blind, and turn the house into a
      hospital again? It's what he would do. I've seen aplenty of that and more.
      No, Washington, I want his strikes to be mighty moderate ones the rest of
      the way down the vale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, big strike or little strike, or no strike at all, here's
      hoping he'll never lack for friends&mdash;and I don't reckon he ever will
      while there's people around who know enough to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Him lack for friends!" and she tilted her head up with a frank pride&mdash;"why,
      Washington, you can't name a man that's anybody that isn't fond of him.
      I'll tell you privately, that I've had Satan's own time to keep them from
      appointing him to some office or other. They knew he'd no business with an
      office, just as well as I did, but he's the hardest man to refuse anything
      to a body ever saw. Mulberry Sellers with an office! laws goodness, you
      know what that would be like. Why, they'd come from the ends of the earth
      to see a circus like that. I'd just as lieves be married to Niagara Falls,
      and done with it." After a reflective pause she added&mdash;having
      wandered back, in the interval, to the remark that had been her text:
      "Friends?&mdash;oh, indeed, no man ever had more; and such friends: Grant,
      Sherman, Sheridan, Johnston, Longstreet, Lee&mdash;many's the time they've
      sat in that chair you're sitting in&mdash;" Hawkins was out of it
      instantly, and contemplating it with a reverential surprise, and with the
      awed sense of having trodden shod upon holy ground&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "They!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed, yes, a many and a many a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued to gaze at the chair fascinated, magnetized; and for once in
      his life that continental stretch of dry prairie which stood for his
      imagination was afire, and across it was marching a slanting flamefront
      that joined its wide horizons together and smothered the skies with smoke.
      He was experiencing what one or another drowsing, geographically ignorant
      alien experiences every day in the year when he turns a dull and
      indifferent eye out of the car window and it falls upon a certain
      station-sign which reads "Stratford-on-Avon!" Mrs. Sellers went gossiping
      comfortably along:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, they like to hear him talk, especially if their load is getting
      rather heavy on one shoulder and they want to shift it. He's all air, you
      know,&mdash;breeze, you may say&mdash;and he freshens them up; it's a trip
      to the country, they say. Many a time he's made General Grant laugh&mdash;and
      that's a tidy job, I can tell you, and as for Sheridan, his eye lights up
      and he listens to Mulberry Sellers the same as if he was artillery. You
      see, the charm about Mulberry is, he is so catholic and unprejudiced that
      he fits in anywhere and everywhere. It makes him powerful good company,
      and as popular as scandal. You go to the White House when the President's
      holding a general reception&mdash;sometime when Mulberry's there. Why,
      dear me, you can't tell which of them it is that's holding that
      reception."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he certainly is a remarkable man&mdash;and he always was. Is he
      religious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clear to his marrow&mdash;does more thinking and reading on that subject
      than any other except Russia and Siberia: thrashes around over the whole
      field, too; nothing bigoted about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is his religion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He&mdash;" She stopped, and was lost for a moment or two in thinking,
      then she said, with simplicity, "I think he was a Mohammedan or something
      last week."
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington started down town, now, to bring his trunk, for the hospitable
      Sellerses would listen to no excuses; their house must be his home during
      the session. The Colonel returned presently and resumed work upon his
      plaything. It was finished when Washington got back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There it is," said the Colonel, "all finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it for, Colonel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's just a trifle. Toy to amuse the children."
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington examined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to be a puzzle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's what it is. I call it Pigs in the Clover. Put them in&mdash;see
      if you can put them in the pen."
    </p>
    <p>
      After many failures Washington succeeded, and was as pleased as a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's wonderfully ingenious, Colonel, it's ever so clever and interesting&mdash;why,
      I could play with it all day. What are you going to do with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing. Patent it and throw it aside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you do anything of the kind. There's money in that thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      A compassionate look traveled over the Colonel's countenance, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money&mdash;yes; pin money: a couple of hundred thousand, perhaps. Not
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington's eyes blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A couple of hundred thousand dollars! do you call that pin money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel rose and tip-toed his way across the room, closed a door that
      was slightly ajar, tip-toed his way to his seat again, and said, under his
      breath:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can keep a secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington nodded his affirmative, he was too awed to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have heard of materialization&mdash;materialization of departed
      spirits?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington had heard of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And probably didn't believe in it; and quite right, too. The thing as
      practised by ignorant charlatans is unworthy of attention or respect&mdash;where
      there's a dim light and a dark cabinet, and a parcel of sentimental gulls
      gathered together, with their faith and their shudders and their tears all
      ready, and one and the same fatty degeneration of protoplasm and humbug
      comes out and materializes himself into anybody you want, grandmother,
      grandchild, brother-in-law, Witch of Endor, John Milton, Siamese twins,
      Peter the Great, and all such frantic nonsense&mdash;no, that is all
      foolish and pitiful. But when a man that is competent brings the vast
      powers of science to bear, it's a different matter, a totally different
      matter, you see. The spectre that answers that call has come to stay. Do
      you note the commercial value of that detail?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I&mdash;the&mdash;the truth is, that I don't quite know that I do.
      Do you mean that such, being permanent, not transitory, would give more
      general satisfaction, and so enhance the price&mdash;of tickets to the
      show&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show? Folly&mdash;listen to me; and get a good grip on your breath, for
      you are going to need it. Within three days I shall have completed my
      method, and then&mdash;let the world stand aghast, for it shall see
      marvels. Washington, within three days&mdash;ten at the outside&mdash;you
      shall see me call the dead of any century, and they will arise and walk.
      Walk?&mdash;they shall walk forever, and never die again. Walk with all
      the muscle and spring of their pristine vigor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colonel! Indeed it does take one's breath away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now do you see the money that's in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm&mdash;well, I'm&mdash;not really sure that I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great Scott, look here. I shall have a monopoly; they'll all belong to
      me, won't they? Two thousand policemen in the city of New York. Wages,
      four dollars a day. I'll replace them with dead ones at half the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, prodigious! I never thought of that. F-o-u-r thousand dollars a day.
      Now I do begin to see! But will dead policemen answer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't they&mdash;up to this time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you put it that way&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put it any way you want to. Modify it to suit yourself, and my lads shall
      still be superior. They won't eat, they won't drink&mdash;don't need those
      things; they won't wink for cash at gambling dens and unlicensed
      rum-holes, they won't spark the scullery maids; and moreover the bands of
      toughs that ambuscade them on lonely beats, and cowardly shoot and knife
      them will only damage the uniforms and not live long enough to get more
      than a momentary satisfaction out of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Colonel, if you can furnish policemen, then of course&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly&mdash;I can furnish any line of goods that's wanted. Take the
      army, for instance&mdash;now twenty-five thousand men; expense, twenty-two
      millions a year. I will dig up the Romans, I will resurrect the Greeks, I
      will furnish the government, for ten millions a year, ten thousand
      veterans drawn from the victorious legions of all the ages&mdash;soldiers
      that will chase Indians year in and year out on materialized horses, and
      cost never a cent for rations or repairs. The armies of Europe cost two
      billions a year now&mdash;I will replace them all for a billion. I will
      dig up the trained statesmen of all ages and all climes, and furnish this
      country with a Congress that knows enough to come in out of the rain&mdash;a
      thing that's never happened yet, since the Declaration of Independence,
      and never will happen till these practically dead people are replaced with
      the genuine article. I will restock the thrones of Europe with the best
      brains and the best morals that all the royal sepulchres of all the
      centuries can furnish&mdash;which isn't promising very much&mdash;and I'll
      divide the wages and the civil list, fair and square, merely taking my
      half and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colonel, if the half of this is true, there's millions in it&mdash;millions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Billions in it&mdash;billions; that's what you mean. Why, look here; the
      thing is so close at hand, so imminent, so absolutely immediate, that if a
      man were to come to me now and say, Colonel, I am a little short, and if
      you could lend me a couple of billion dollars for&mdash;come in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This in answer to a knock. An energetic looking man bustled in with a big
      pocket-book in his hand, took a paper from it and presented it, with the
      curt remark:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seventeenth and last call&mdash;you want to out with that three dollars
      and forty cents this time without fail, Colonel Mulberry Sellers."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel began to slap this pocket and that one, and feel here and
      there and everywhere, muttering:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have I done with that wallet?&mdash;let me see&mdash;um&mdash;not
      here, not there &mdash;Oh, I must have left it in the kitchen; I'll just
      run and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No you won't&mdash;you'll stay right where you are. And you're going to
      disgorge, too&mdash;this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington innocently offered to go and look. When he was gone the Colonel
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is, I've got to throw myself on your indulgence just this once
      more, Suggs; you see the remittances I was expecting&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang the remittances&mdash;it's too stale&mdash;it won't answer. Come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel glanced about him in despair. Then his face lighted; he ran to
      the wall and began to dust off a peculiarly atrocious chromo with his
      handkerchief. Then he brought it reverently, offered it to the collector,
      averted his face and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take it, but don't let me see it go. It's the sole remaining Rembrandt
      that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rembrandt be damned, it's a chromo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't speak of it so, I beg you. It's the only really great original,
      the only supreme example of that mighty school of art which&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Art! It's the sickest looking thing I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel was already bringing another horror and tenderly dusting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take this one too&mdash;the gem of my collection&mdash;the only genuine
      Fra Angelico that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Illuminated liver-pad, that's what it is. Give it here&mdash;good day&mdash;people
      will think I've robbed a' nigger barber-shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he slammed the door behind him the Colonel shouted with an anguished
      accent&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do please cover them up&mdash;don't let the damp get at them. The
      delicate tints in the Angelico&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington re-appeared and said he had looked everywhere, and so had Mrs.
      Sellers and the servants, but in vain; and went on to say he wished he
      could get his eye on a certain man about this time&mdash;no need to hunt
      up that pocket-book then. The Colonel's interest was awake at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One-armed Pete they call him out there&mdash;out in the Cherokee country
      I mean. Robbed the bank in Tahlequah."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do they have banks in Tahlequah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;a bank, anyway. He was suspected of robbing it. Whoever did it
      got away with more than twenty thousand dollars. They offered a reward of
      five thousand. I believe I saw that very man, on my way east."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;is that so?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly saw a man on the train, the first day I struck the railroad,
      that answered the description pretty exactly&mdash;at least as to clothes
      and a lacking arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why din't you get him arrested and claim the reward?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't. I had to get a requisition, of course. But I meant to stay by
      him till I got my chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, he left the train during the night some time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, hang it, that's too bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so very bad, either."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he came down to Baltimore in the very train I was in, though I
      didn't know it in time. As we moved out of the station I saw him going
      toward the iron gate with a satchel in his hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good; we'll catch him. Let's lay a plan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send description to the Baltimore police?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what are you talking about? No. Do you want them to get the reward?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall we do, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll tell you. Put a personal in the Baltimore Sun. Word it like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "A. DROP ME A LINE, PETE."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      "Hold on. Which arm has he lost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Now then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "A. DROP ME A LINE, PETE, EVEN IF YOU HAVE to write with your left hand.
        Address X. Y. Z., General Postoffice, Washington. From YOU KNOW WHO."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "There&mdash;that'll fetch him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he won't know who&mdash;will he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but he'll want to know, won't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, certainly&mdash;I didn't think of that. What made you think of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knowledge of human curiosity. Strong trait, very strong trait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I'll go to my room and write it out and enclose a dollar and tell
      them to print it to the worth of that."

      The day wore itself out. After dinner the two friends put in a long and
      harassing evening trying to decide what to do with the five thousand
      dollars reward which they were going to get when they should find
      One-Armed Pete, and catch him, and prove him to be the right person, and
      extradite him, and ship him to Tahlequah in the Indian Territory. But
      there were so many dazzling openings for ready cash that they found it
      impossible to make up their minds and keep them made up. Finally, Mrs.
      Sellers grew very weary of it all, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the sense in cooking a rabbit before it's caught?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the matter was dropped, for the time being, and all went to bed. Next
      morning, being persuaded by Hawkins, the colonel made drawings and
      specifications and went down and applied for a patent for his toy puzzle,
      and Hawkins took the toy itself and started out to see what chance there
      might be to do something with it commercially. He did not have to go far.
      In a small old wooden shanty which had once been occupied as a dwelling by
      some humble negro family he found a keen-eyed Yankee engaged in repairing
      cheap chairs and other second-hand furniture. This man examined the toy
      indifferently; attempted to do the puzzle; found it not so easy as he had
      expected; grew more interested, and finally emphatically so; achieved a
      success at last, and asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it patented?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patent applied for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will answer. What do you want for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will it retail for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, twenty-five cents, I should think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will you give for the exclusive right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't give twenty dollars, if I had to pay cash down; but I'll tell
      you what I'll do. I'll make it and market it, and pay you five cents
      royalty on each one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington sighed. Another dream disappeared; no money in the thing. So he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, take it at that. Draw me a paper." He went his way with the
      paper, and dropped the matter out of his mind dropped it out to make room
      for further attempts to think out the most promising way to invest his
      half of the reward, in case a partnership investment satisfactory to both
      beneficiaries could not be hit upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been very long at home when Sellers arrived sodden with grief
      and booming with glad excitement&mdash;working both these emotions
      successfully, sometimes separately, sometimes together. He fell on
      Hawkins's neck sobbing, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mourn with me my friend, mourn for my desolate house: death has
      smitten my last kinsman and I am Earl of Rossmore&mdash;congratulate me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to his wife, who had entered while this was going on, put his
      arms about her and said&mdash;"You will bear up, for my sake, my lady&mdash;it
      had to happen, it was decreed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She bore up very well, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no great loss. Simon Lathers was a poor well-meaning useless thing
      and no account, and his brother never was worth shucks."
    </p>
    <p>
      The rightful earl continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am too much prostrated by these conflicting griefs and joys to be able
      to concentrate my mind upon affairs; I will ask our good friend here to
      break the news by wire or post to the Lady Gwendolen and instruct her to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What Lady Gwendolen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our poor daughter, who, alas!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sally Sellers? Mulberry Sellers, are you losing your mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There&mdash;please do not forget who you are, and who I am; remember your
      own dignity, be considerate also of mine. It were best to cease from using
      my family name, now, Lady Rossmore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness gracious, well, I never! What am I to call you then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In private, the ordinary terms of endearment will still be admissible, to
      some degree; but in public it will be more becoming if your ladyship will
      speak to me as my lord, or your lordship, and of me as Rossmore, or the
      Earl, or his Lordship, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, scat! I can't ever do it, Berry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But indeed you must, my love&mdash;we must live up to our altered
      position and submit with what grace we may to its requirements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, all right, have it your own way; I've never set my wishes against
      your commands yet, Mul&mdash;my lord, and it's late to begin now, though
      to my mind it's the rottenest foolishness that ever was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spoken like my own true wife! There, kiss and be friends again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;Gwendolen! I don't know how I am ever going to stand that name.
      Why, a body wouldn't know Sally Sellers in it. It's too large for her;
      kind of like a cherub in an ulster, and it's a most outlandish sort of a
      name, anyway, to my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll not hear her find fault with it, my lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a true word. She takes to any kind of romantic rubbish like she
      was born to it. She never got it from me, that's sure. And sending her to
      that silly college hasn't helped the matter any&mdash;just the other way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now hear her, Hawkins! Rowena-Ivanhoe College is the selectest and most
      aristocratic seat of learning for young ladies in our country. Under no
      circumstances can a girl get in there unless she is either very rich and
      fashionable or can prove four generations of what may be called American
      nobility. Castellated college-buildings&mdash;towers and turrets and an
      imitation moat&mdash;and everything about the place named out of Sir
      Walter Scott's books and redolent of royalty and state and style; and all
      the richest girls keep phaetons, and coachmen in livery, and
      riding-horses, with English grooms in plug hats and tight-buttoned coats,
      and top-boots, and a whip-handle without any whip to it, to ride
      sixty-three feet behind them&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they don't learn a blessed thing, Washington Hawkins, not a single
      blessed thing but showy rubbish and un-american pretentiousness. But send
      for the Lady Gwendolen&mdash;do; for I reckon the peerage regulations
      require that she must come home and let on to go into seclusion and mourn
      for those Arkansas blatherskites she's lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My darling! Blatherskites? Remember&mdash;noblesse oblige."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there&mdash;talk to me in your own tongue, Ross&mdash;you don't
      know any other, and you only botch it when you try. Oh, don't stare&mdash;it
      was a slip, and no crime; customs of a life-time can't be dropped in a
      second. Rossmore&mdash;there, now, be appeased, and go along with you and
      attend to Gwendolen. Are you going to write, Washington?&mdash;or
      telegraph?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will telegraph, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought as much," my lady muttered, as she left the room. "Wants it so
      the address will have to appear on the envelop. It will just make a fool
      of that child. She'll get it, of course, for if there are any other
      Sellerses there they'll not be able to claim it. And just leave her alone
      to show it around and make the most of it. Well, maybe she's forgivable
      for that. She's so poor and they're so rich, of course she's had her share
      of snubs from the livery-flunkey sort, and I reckon it's only human to
      want to get even."
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dan'l was sent with the telegram; for although a conspicuous object
      in a corner of the drawing-room was a telephone hanging on a transmitter,
      Washington found all attempts to raise the central office vain. The
      Colonel grumbled something about its being "always out of order when
      you've got particular and especial use for it," but he didn't explain that
      one of the reasons for this was that the thing was only a dummy and hadn't
      any wire attached to it. And yet the Colonel often used it&mdash;when
      visitors were present&mdash;and seemed to get messages through it.
      Mourning paper and a seal were ordered, then the friends took a rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next afternoon, while Hawkins, by request, draped Andrew Jackson's
      portrait with crape, the rightful earl, wrote off the family bereavement
      to the usurper in England&mdash;a letter which we have already read. He
      also, by letter to the village authorities at Duffy's Corners, Arkansas,
      gave order that the remains of the late twins be embalmed by some St.
      Louis expert and shipped at once to the usurper&mdash;with bill. Then he
      drafted out the Rossmore arms and motto on a great sheet of brown paper,
      and he and Hawkins took it to Hawkins's Yankee furniture-mender and at the
      end of an hour came back with a couple of stunning hatchments, which they
      nailed up on the front of the house&mdash;attractions calculated to draw,
      and they did; for it was mainly an idle and shiftless negro neighborhood,
      with plenty of ragged children and indolent dogs to spare for a point of
      interest like that, and keep on sparing them for it, days and days
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new earl found&mdash;without surprise&mdash;this society item in the
      evening paper, and cut it out and scrapbooked it:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <br /> By a recent bereavement our esteemed fellow citizen, Colonel
        Mulberry Sellers, Perpetual Member-at-large of the Diplomatic Body,
        succeeds, as rightful lord, to the great earldom of Rossmore, third by
        order of precedence in the earldoms of Great Britain, and will take
        early measures, by suit in the House of Lords, to wrest the title and
        estates from the present usurping holder of them. Until the season of
        mourning is past, the usual Thursday evening receptions at Rossmore
        Towers will be discontinued. <br />
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Lady Rossmore's comment-to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Receptions! People who don't rightly know him may think he is
      commonplace, but to my mind he is one of the most unusual men I ever saw.
      As for suddenness and capacity in imagining things, his beat don't exist,
      I reckon. As like as not it wouldn't have occurred to anybody else to name
      this poor old rat-trap Rossmore Towers, but it just comes natural to him.
      Well, no doubt it's a blessed thing to have an imagination that can always
      make you satisfied, no matter how you are fixed. Uncle Dave Hopkins used
      to always say, 'Turn me into John Calvin, and I want to know which place
      I'm going to; turn me into Mulberry Sellers and I don't care.'"

    <p>
      The rightful earl's comment-to himself:

      No answer to that telegram; no arriving daughter. Yet nobody showed any
      uneasiness or seemed surprised; that is, nobody but Washington. After
      three days of waiting, he asked Lady Rossmore what she supposed the
      trouble was. She answered, tranquilly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's some notion of hers, you never can tell. She's a Sellers, all
      through&mdash;at least in some of her ways; and a Sellers can't tell you
      beforehand what he's going to do, because he don't know himself till he's
      done it. She's all right; no occasion to worry about her. When she's ready
      she'll come or she'll write, and you can't tell which, till it's
      happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      It turned out to be a letter. It was handed in at that moment, and was
      received by the mother without trembling hands or feverish eagerness, or
      any other of the manifestations common in the case of long delayed answers
      to imperative telegrams. She polished her glasses with tranquility and
      thoroughness, pleasantly gossiping along, the while, then opened the
      letter and began to read aloud:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <br /> <br /> KENILWORTH KEEP, REDGAUNTLET HALL, <br /> ROWENA-IVANHOE
        COLLEGE, THURSDAY. <br /><br /> <br /> DEAR PRECIOUS MAMMA ROSSMORE: <br /><br />
        Oh, the joy of it!&mdash;you can't think. They had always turned up
        their noses at our pretentions, you know; and I had fought back as well
        as I could by turning up mine at theirs. They always said it might be
        something great and fine to be the rightful Shadow of an earldom, but to
        merely be shadow of a shadow, and two or three times removed at that&mdash;pooh-pooh!
        And I always retorted that not to be able to show four generations of
        American-Colonial-Dutch Peddler-and-Salt-Cod-McAllister-Nobility might
        be endurable, but to have to confess such an origin&mdash;pfew-few!
        Well, the telegram, it was just a cyclone! The messenger came right into
        the great Rob Roy Hall of Audience, as excited as he could be, singing
        out, "Dispatch for Lady Gwendolen Sellers!" and you ought to have seen
        that simpering chattering assemblage of pinchbeck aristocrats, turn to
        stone! I was off in the corner, of course, by myself&mdash;it's where
        Cinderella belongs. I took the telegram and read it, and tried to faint&mdash;and
        I could have done it if I had had any preparation, but it was all so
        sudden, you know&mdash;but no matter, I did the next best thing: I put
        my handkerchief to my eyes and fled sobbing to my room, dropping the
        telegram as I started. I released one corner of my eye a moment&mdash;just
        enough to see the herd swarm for the telegram&mdash;and then continued
        my broken-hearted flight just as happy as a bird. <br /><br /> Then the
        visits of condolence began, and I had to accept the loan of Miss
        Augusta-Templeton-Ashmore Hamilton's quarters because the press was so
        great and there isn't room for three and a cat in mine. And I've been
        holding a Lodge of Sorrow ever since and defending myself against
        people's attempts to claim kin. And do you know, the very first girl to
        fetch her tears and sympathy to my market was that foolish Skimperton
        girl who has always snubbed me so shamefully and claimed lordship and
        precedence of the whole college because some ancestor of hers, some time
        or other, was a McAllister. Why it was like the bottom bird in the
        menagerie putting on airs because its head ancestor was a pterodactyl.
        <br /><br /> But the ger-reatest triumph of all was&mdash;guess. But
        you'll never. This is it. That little fool and two others have always
        been fussing and fretting over which was entitled to precedence&mdash;by
        rank, you know. They've nearly starved themselves at it; for each
        claimed the right to take precedence of all the college in leaving the
        table, and so neither of them ever finished her dinner, but broke off in
        the middle and tried to get out ahead of the others. Well, after my
        first day's grief and seclusion&mdash;I was fixing up a mourning dress
        you see&mdash;I appeared at the public table again, and then&mdash;what
        do you think? Those three fluffy goslings sat there contentedly, and
        squared up the long famine&mdash;lapped and lapped, munched and munched,
        ate and ate, till the gravy appeared in their eyes&mdash;humbly waiting
        for the Lady Gwendolen to take precedence and move out first, you see!
        <br /><br /> Oh, yes, I've been having a darling good time. And do you
        know, not one of these collegians has had the cruelty to ask me how I
        came by my new name. With some, this is due to charity, but with the
        others it isn't. They refrain, not from native kindness but from
        educated discretion. I educated them. <br /><br /> Well, as soon as I
        shall have settled up what's left of the old scores and snuffed up a few
        more of those pleasantly intoxicating clouds of incense, I shall pack
        and depart homeward. Tell papa I am as fond of him as I am of my new
        name. I couldn't put it stronger than that. What an inspiration it was!
        But inspirations come easy to him. <br /><br /> <br /> These, from your
        loving daughter, <br /> GWENDOLEN. <br /><br />
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Hawkins reached for the letter and glanced over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good hand," he said, "and full of confidence and animation, and goes
      racing right along. She's bright&mdash;that's plain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, they're all bright&mdash;the Sellerses. Anyway, they would be, if
      there were any. Even those poor Latherses would have been bright if they
      had been Sellerses; I mean full blood. Of course they had a Sellers strain
      in them&mdash;a big strain of it, too&mdash;but being a Bland dollar don't
      make it a dollar just the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      The seventh day after the date of the telegram Washington came dreaming
      down to breakfast and was set wide awake by an electrical spasm of
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was the most beautiful young creature he had ever seen in his life.
      It was Sally Sellers Lady Gwendolen; she had come in the night. And it
      seemed to him that her clothes were the prettiest and the daintiest he had
      ever looked upon, and the most exquisitely contrived and fashioned and
      combined, as to decorative trimmings, and fixings, and melting harmonies
      of color. It was only a morning dress, and inexpensive, but he confessed
      to himself, in the English common to Cherokee Strip, that it was a
      "corker." And now, as he perceived, the reason why the Sellers household
      poverties and sterilities had been made to blossom like the rose, and
      charm the eye and satisfy the spirit, stood explained; here was the
      magician; here in the midst of her works, and furnishing in her own person
      the proper accent and climaxing finish of the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter, Major Hawkins&mdash;come home to mourn; flown home at the
      call of affliction to help the authors of her being bear the burden of
      bereavement. She was very fond of the late earl&mdash;idolized him, sir,
      idolized him&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, father, I've never seen him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True&mdash;she's right, I was thinking of another&mdash;er&mdash;of her
      mother&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I idolized that smoked haddock?&mdash;that sentimental, spiritless&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking of myself! Poor noble fellow, we were inseparable com&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear the man! Mulberry Sel&mdash;Mul&mdash;Rossmore&mdash;hang the
      troublesome name I can never&mdash;if I've heard you say once, I've heard
      you say a thousand times that if that poor sheep&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was thinking of&mdash;of&mdash;I don't know who I was thinking of, and
      it doesn't make any difference anyway; somebody idolized him, I recollect
      it as if it were yesterday; and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, I am going to shake hands with Major Hawkins, and let the
      introduction work along and catch up at its leisure. I remember you very
      well in deed, Major Hawkins, although I was a little child when I saw you
      last; and I am very, very glad indeed to see you again and have you in our
      house as one of us;" and beaming in his face she finished her cordial
      shake with the hope that he had not forgotten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="p061" id="p061"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

      He was prodigiously pleased by her outspoken heartiness, and wanted to
      repay her by assuring her that he remembered her, and not only that but
      better even than he remembered his own children, but the facts would not
      quite warrant this; still, he stumbled through a tangled sentence which
      answered just as well, since the purport of it was an awkward and
      unintentional confession that her extraordinary beauty had so stupefied
      him that he hadn't got back to his bearings, yet, and therefore couldn't
      be certain as to whether he remembered her at all or not. The speech made
      him her friend; it couldn't well help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth the beauty of this fair creature was of a rare type, and may well
      excuse a moment of our time spent in its consideration. It did not consist
      in the fact that she had eyes, nose, mouth, chin, hair, ears, it consisted
      in their arrangement. In true beauty, more depends upon right location and
      judicious distribution of feature than upon multiplicity of them. So also
      as regards color. The very combination of colors which in a volcanic
      irruption would add beauty to a landscape might detach it from a girl.
      Such was Gwendolen Sellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family circle being completed by Gwendolen's arrival, it was decreed
      that the official mourning should now begin; that it should begin at six
      o'clock every evening, (the dinner hour,) and end with the dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a grand old line, major, a sublime old line, and deserves to be
      mourned for, almost royally; almost imperially, I may say. Er&mdash;Lady
      Gwendolen&mdash;but she's gone; never mind; I wanted my Peerage; I'll
      fetch it myself, presently, and show you a thing or two that will give you
      a realizing idea of what our house is. I've been glancing through Burke,
      and I find that of William the Conqueror's sixty-four natural ch&mdash;my
      dear, would you mind getting me that book? It's on the escritoire in our
      boudoir. Yes, as I was saying, there's only St. Albans, Buccleugh and
      Grafton ahead of us on the list&mdash;all the rest of the British nobility
      are in procession behind us. Ah, thanks, my lady. Now then, we turn to
      William, and we find&mdash;letter for XYZ? Oh, splendid&mdash;when'd you
      get it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last night; but I was asleep before you came, you were out so late; and
      when I came to breakfast Miss Gwendolen&mdash;well, she knocked everything
      out of me, you know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful girl, wonderful; her great origin is detectable in her step,
      her carriage, her features&mdash;but what does he say? Come, this is
      exciting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't read it&mdash;er&mdash;Rossm&mdash;Mr. Rossm&mdash;er&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M'lord! Just cut it short like that. It's the English way. I'll open it.
      Ah, now let's see."
    </p>
    <p>
      A. TO YOU KNOW WHO. Think I know you. Wait ten days. Coming to Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitement died out of both men's faces. There was a brooding silence
      for a while, then the younger one said with a sigh:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, we can't wait ten days for the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;the man's unreasonable; we are down to the bed rock, financially
      speaking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we could explain to him in some way, that we are so situated that time
      is of the utmost importance to us&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;yes, that's it&mdash;and so if it would be as convenient for
      him to come at once it would be a great accommodation to us, and one which
      we&mdash;which we&mdash;which we&mdash;wh&mdash;well, which we should
      sincerely appreciate&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it&mdash;and most gladly reciprocate&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly&mdash;that'll fetch him. Worded right, if he's a man&mdash;got
      any of the feelings of a man, sympathies and all that, he'll be here
      inside of twenty-four hours. Pen and paper&mdash;come, we'll get right at
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Between them they framed twenty-two different advertisements, but none was
      satisfactory. A main fault in all of them was urgency. That feature was
      very troublesome: if made prominent, it was calculated to excite Pete's
      suspicion; if modified below the suspicion-point it was flat and
      meaningless. Finally the Colonel resigned, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have noticed, in such literary experiences as I have had, that one of
      the most taking things to do is to conceal your meaning when you are
      trying to conceal it. Whereas, if you go at literature with a free
      conscience and nothing to conceal, you can turn out a book, every time,
      that the very elect can't understand. They all do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Hawkins resigned also, and the two agreed that they must manage to
      wait the ten days some how or other. Next, they caught a ray of cheer:
      since they had something definite to go upon, now, they could probably
      borrow money on the reward&mdash;enough, at any rate, to tide them over
      till they got it; and meantime the materializing recipe would be
      perfected, and then good bye to trouble for good and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, May the tenth, a couple of things happened&mdash;among
      others. The remains of the noble Arkansas twins left our shores for
      England, consigned to Lord Rossmore, and Lord Rossmore's son,
      Kirkcudbright Llanover Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount Berkeley, sailed from
      Liverpool for America to place the reversion of the earldom in the hands
      of the rightful peer, Mulberry Sellers, of Rossmore Towers in the District
      of Columbia, U. S. A.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two impressive shipments would meet and part in mid-Atlantic, five
      days later, and give no sign.

    </p>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of time the twins arrived and were delivered to their great
      kinsman. To try to describe the rage of that old man would profit nothing,
      the attempt would fall so far short of the purpose. However when he had
      worn himself out and got quiet again, he looked the matter over and
      decided that the twins had some moral rights, although they had no legal
      ones; they were of his blood, and it could not be decorous to treat them
      as common clay. So he laid them with their majestic kin in the
      Cholmondeley church, with imposing state and ceremony, and added the
      supreme touch by officiating as chief mourner himself. But he drew the
      line at hatchments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our friends in Washington watched the weary days go by, while they waited
      for Pete and covered his name with reproaches because of his calamitous
      procrastinations. Meantime, Sally Sellers, who was as practical and
      democratic as the Lady Gwendolen Sellers was romantic and aristocratic,
      was leading a life of intense interest and activity and getting the most
      she could out of her double personality. All day long in the privacy of
      her work-room, Sally Sellers earned bread for the Sellers family; and all
      the evening Lady Gwendolen Sellers supported the Rossmore dignity. All day
      she was American, practically, and proud of the work of her head and hands
      and its commercial result; all the evening she took holiday and dwelt in a
      rich shadow-land peopled with titled and coroneted fictions. By day, to
      her, the place was a plain, unaffected, ramshackle old trap&mdash; just
      that, and nothing more; by night it was Rossmore Towers. At college she
      had learned a trade without knowing it. The girls had found out that she
      was the designer of her own gowns. She had no idle moments after that, and
      wanted none; for the exercise of an extraordinary gift is the supremest
      pleasure in life, and it was manifest that Sally Sellers possessed a gift
      of that sort in the matter of costume-designing. Within three days after
      reaching home she had hunted up some work; before Pete was yet due in
      Washington, and before the twins were fairly asleep in English soil, she
      was already nearly swamped with work, and the sacrificing of the family
      chromos for debt had got an effective check.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a brick," said Rossmore to the Major; "just her father all over:
      prompt to labor with head or hands, and not ashamed of it; capable, always
      capable, let the enterprise be what it may; successful by nature&mdash;don't
      know what defeat is; thus, intensely and practically American by inhaled
      nationalism, and at the same time intensely and aristocratically European
      by inherited nobility of blood. Just me, exactly: Mulberry Sellers in
      matter of finance and invention; after office hours, what do you find? The
      same clothes, yes, but what's in them? Rossmore of the peerage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two friends had haunted the general post-office daily. At last they
      had their reward. Toward evening on the 20th of May, they got a letter for
      XYZ. It bore the Washington postmark; the note itself was not dated. It
      said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "Ash barrel back of lamp post Black horse Alley. If you are playing
        square go and set on it to-morrow morning 21st 10.22 not sooner not
        later wait till I come."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The friends cogitated over the note profoundly. Presently the earl said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you reckon he's afraid we are a sheriff with a requisition?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, m'lord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because that's no place for a seance. Nothing friendly, nothing sociable
      about it. And at the same time, a body that wanted to know who was
      roosting on that ash-barrel without exposing himself by going near it, or
      seeming to be interested in it, could just stand on the street corner and
      take a glance down the alley and satisfy himself, don't you see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, his idea is plain, now. He seems to be a man that can't be candid
      and straightforward. He acts as if he thought we&mdash;shucks, I wish he
      had come out like a man and told us what hotel he&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now you've struck it! you've struck it sure, Washington; he has told us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he has; but he didn't mean to. That alley is a lonesome little
      pocket that runs along one side of the New Gadsby. That's his hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes' you think that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I just know it. He's got a room that's just across from that lamp
      post. He's going to sit there perfectly comfortable behind his shutters at
      10.22 to-morrow, and when he sees us sitting on the ash-barrel, he'll say
      to himself, 'I saw one of those fellows on the train'&mdash;and then he'll
      pack his satchel in half a minute and ship for the ends of the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins turned sick with disappointment:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear, it's all up, Colonel&mdash;it's exactly what he'll do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed he won't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't he? Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you won't be holding the ash barrel down, it'll be me. You'll be
      coming in with an officer and a requisition in plain clothes&mdash;the
      officer, I mean&mdash;the minute you see him arrive and open up a talk
      with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what a head you have got, Colonel Sellers! I never should have
      thought of that in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither would any earl of Rossmore, betwixt William's contribution and
      Mulberry&mdash;as earl; but it's office hours, now, you see, and the earl
      in me sleeps. Come&mdash;I'll show you his very room."
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the neighborhood of the New Gadsby about nine in the evening,
      and passed down the alley to the lamp post.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are," said the colonel, triumphantly, with a wave of his hand
      which took in the whole side of the hotel. "There it is&mdash;what did I
      tell you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but&mdash;why, Colonel, it's six stories high. I don't quite make
      out which window you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the windows, all of them. Let him have his choice&mdash;I'm
      indifferent, now that I have located him. You go and stand on the corner
      and wait; I'll prospect the hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl drifted here and there through the swarming lobby, and finally
      took a waiting position in the neighborhood of the elevator. During an
      hour crowds went up and crowds came down; and all complete as to limbs;
      but at last the watcher got a glimpse of a figure that was satisfactory&mdash;got
      a glimpse of the back of it, though he had missed his chance at the face
      through waning alertness. The glimpse revealed a cowboy hat, and below it
      a plaided sack of rather loud pattern, and an empty sleeve pinned up to
      the shoulder. Then the elevator snatched the vision aloft and the watcher
      fled away in joyful excitement, and rejoined the fellow-conspirator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got him, Major&mdash;got him sure! I've seen him&mdash;seen him
      good; and I don't care where or when that man approaches me backwards,
      I'll recognize him every time. We're all right. Now for the requisition."
    </p>
    <p>
      They got it, after the delays usual in such cases. By half past eleven
      they were at home and happy, and went to bed full of dreams of the
      morrow's great promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the elevator load which had the suspect for fellow-passenger was a
      young kinsman of Mulberry Sellers, but Mulberry was not aware of it and
      didn't see him. It was Viscount Berkeley.

      CHAPTER VII.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in his room Lord Berkeley made preparations for that first and
      last and all-the-time duty of the visiting Englishman&mdash;the jotting
      down in his diary of his "impressions" to date. His preparations consisted
      in ransacking his "box" for a pen. There was a plenty of steel pens on his
      table with the ink bottle, but he was English. The English people
      manufacture steel pens for nineteen-twentieths of the globe, but they
      never use any themselves. They use exclusively the pre-historic quill. My
      lord not only found a quill pen, but the best one he had seen in several
      years&mdash;and after writing diligently for some time, closed with the
      following entry:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <a name="p071" id="p071"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img alt="p071.jpg (18K)" src="images/p071.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        BUT IN ONE THING I HAVE MADE AN IMMENSE MISTAKE, I OUGHT TO HAVE SHUCKED
        MY TITLE AND CHANGED MY NAME BEFORE I STARTED.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat admiring that pen a while, and then went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All attempts to mingle with the common people and become permanently one
      of them are going to fail, unless I can get rid of it, disappear from it,
      and re-appear with the solid protection of a new name. I am astonished and
      pained to see how eager the most of these Americans are to get acquainted
      with a lord, and how diligent they are in pushing attentions upon him.
      They lack English servility, it is true&mdash;but they could acquire it,
      with practice. My quality travels ahead of me in the most mysterious way.
      I write my family name without additions, on the register of this hotel,
      and imagine that I am going to pass for an obscure and unknown wanderer,
      but the clerk promptly calls out, 'Front! show his lordship to
      four-eighty-two!' and before I can get to the lift there is a reporter
      trying to interview me as they call it. This sort of thing shall cease at
      once. I will hunt up the American Claimant the first thing in the morning,
      accomplish my mission, then change my lodging and vanish from scrutiny
      under a fictitious name."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his diary on the table, where it would be handy in case any new
      "impressions" should wake him up in the night, then he went to bed and
      presently fell asleep. An hour or two passed, and then he came slowly to
      consciousness with a confusion of mysterious and augmenting sounds
      hammering at the gates of his brain for admission; the next moment he was
      sharply awake, and those sounds burst with the rush and roar and boom of
      an undammed freshet into his ears. Banging and slamming of shutters;
      smashing of windows and the ringing clash of falling glass; clatter of
      flying feet along the halls; shrieks, supplications, dumb moanings of
      despair, within, hoarse shouts of command outside; cracklings and
      snappings, and the windy roar of victorious flames!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bang, bang, bang! on the door, and a cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Turn out&mdash;the house is on fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry passed on, and the banging. Lord Berkeley sprang out of bed and
      moved with all possible speed toward the clothes-press in the darkness and
      the gathering smoke, but fell over a chair and lost his bearings. He
      groped desperately about on his hands, and presently struck his head
      against the table and was deeply grateful, for it gave him his bearings
      again, since it stood close by the door. He seized his most precious
      possession; his journaled Impressions of America, and darted from the
      room.
    </p>

    <p>
      He ran down the deserted hall toward the red lamp which he knew indicated
      the place of a fire-escape. The door of the room beside it was open. In
      the room the gas was burning full head; on a chair was a pile of clothing.
      He ran to the window, could not get it up, but smashed it with a chair,
      and stepped out on the landing of the fire-escape; below him was a crowd
      of men, with a sprinkling of women and youth, massed in a ruddy light.
      Must he go down in his spectral night dress? No&mdash;this side of the
      house was not yet on fire except at the further end; he would snatch on
      those clothes. Which he did. They fitted well enough, though a trifle
      loosely, and they were just a shade loud as to pattern. Also as to hat&mdash;which
      was of a new breed to him, Buffalo Bill not having been to England yet.
      One side of the coat went on, but the other side refused; one of its
      sleeves was turned up and stitched to the shoulder. He started down
      without waiting to get it loose, made the trip successfully, and was
      promptly hustled outside the limit-rope by the police.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cowboy hat and the coat but half on made him too much of a centre of
      attraction for comfort, although nothing could be more profoundly
      respectful, not to say deferential, than was the manner of the crowd
      toward him. In his mind he framed a discouraged remark for early entry in
      his diary: "It is of no use; they know a lord through any disguise, and
      show awe of him&mdash;even something very like fear, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently one of the gaping and adoring half-circle of boys ventured a
      timid question. My lord answered it. The boys glanced wonderingly at each
      other and from somewhere fell the comment:
    </p>
    <p>
      "English cowboy! Well, if that ain't curious."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another mental note to be preserved for the diary: "Cowboy. Now what might
      a cowboy be? Perhaps&mdash;" But the viscount perceived that some more
      questions were about to be asked; so he worked his way out of the crowd,
      released the sleeve, put on the coat and wandered away to seek a humble
      and obscure lodging. He found it and went to bed and was soon asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, he examined his clothes. They were rather assertive, it
      seemed to him, but they were new and clean, at any rate. There was
      considerable property in the pockets. Item, five one-hundred dollar bills.
      Item, near fifty dollars in small bills and silver. Plug of tobacco.
      Hymn-book, which refuses to open; found to contain whiskey. Memorandum
      book bearing no name. Scattering entries in it, recording in a sprawling,
      ignorant hand, appointments, bets, horse-trades, and so on, with people of
      strange, hyphenated name&mdash;Six-Fingered Jake,
      Young-Man-afraid-of-his-Shadow, and the like. No letters, no documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man muses&mdash;maps out his course. His letter of credit is
      burned; he will borrow the small bills and the silver in these pockets,
      apply part of it to advertising for the owner, and use the rest for
      sustenance while he seeks work. He sends out for the morning paper, next,
      and proceeds to read about the fire. The biggest line in the display-head
      announces his own death! The body of the account furnishes all the
      particulars; and tells how, with the inherited heroism of his caste, he
      went on saving women and children until escape for himself was impossible;
      then with the eyes of weeping multitudes upon him, he stood with folded
      arms and sternly awaited the approach of the devouring fiend; "and so
      standing, amid a tossing sea of flame and on-rushing billows of smoke, the
      noble young heir of the great house of Rossmore was caught up in a
      whirlwind of fiery glory, and disappeared forever from the vision of men."
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing was so fine and generous and knightly that it brought the
      moisture to his eyes. Presently he said to himself: "What to do is as
      plain as day, now. My Lord Berkeley is dead&mdash;let him stay so. Died
      creditably, too; that will make the calamity the easier for my father. And
      I don't have to report to the American Claimant, now. Yes, nothing could
      be better than the way matters have turned out. I have only to furnish
      myself with a new name, and take my new start in life totally untrammeled.
      Now I breathe my first breath of real freedom; and how fresh and breezy
      and inspiring it is! At last I am a man! a man on equal terms with my
      neighbor; and by my manhood, and by it alone, I shall rise and be seen of
      the world, or I shall sink from sight and deserve it. This is the gladdest
      day, and the proudest, that ever poured it's sun upon my head!"

    </p>
    <p>
      "GOD bless my soul, Hawkins!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning paper dropped from the Colonel's nerveless-grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's gone!&mdash;the bright, the young, the gifted, the noblest of his
      illustrious race&mdash;gone! gone up in flames and unimaginable glory!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My precious, precious young kinsman&mdash;Kirkcudbright Llanover
      Marjoribanks Sellers Viscount Berkeley, son and heir of usurping
      Rossmore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's true&mdash;too true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right here in Washington; where he arrived from England last night, the
      papers say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't say!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hotel burned down."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What hotel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The New Gadsby!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my goodness! And have we lost both of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One-Arm Pete."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, great guns, I forgot all about him. Oh, I hope not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hope! Well, I should say! Oh, we can't spare him! We can better afford to
      lose a million viscounts than our only support and stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      They searched the paper diligently, and were appalled to find that a
      one-armed man had been seen flying along one of the halls of the hotel in
      his underclothing and apparently out of his head with fright, and as he
      would listen to no one and persisted in making for a stairway which would
      carry him to certain death, his case was given over as a hopeless one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor fellow," sighed Hawkins; "and he had friends so near. I wish we
      hadn't come away from there&mdash;maybe we could have saved him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl looked up and said calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "His being dead doesn't matter. He was uncertain before. We've got him
      sure, this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got him? How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will materialize him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rossmore, don't&mdash;don't trifle with me. Do you mean that? Can you do
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can do it, just as sure as you are sitting there. And I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me your hand, and let me have the comfort of shaking it. I was
      perishing, and you have put new life into me. Get at it, oh, get at it
      right away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will take a little time, Hawkins, but there's no hurry, none in the
      world&mdash;in the circumstances. And of course certain duties have
      devolved upon me now, which necessarily claim my first attention. This
      poor young nobleman&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, I am sorry for my heartlessness, and you smitten with this new
      family affliction. Of course you must materialize him first&mdash;I quite
      understand that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;I&mdash;well, I wasn't meaning just that, but,&mdash;why, what am
      I thinking of! Of course I must materialize him. Oh, Hawkins, selfishness
      is the bottom trait in human nature; I was only thinking that now, with
      the usurper's heir out of the way. But you'll forgive that momentary
      weakness, and forget it. Don't ever remember it against me that Mulberry
      Sellers was once mean enough to think the thought that I was thinking.
      I'll materialise him&mdash;I will, on my honor&mdash;and I'd do it were he
      a thousand heirs jammed into one and stretching in a solid rank from here
      to the stolen estates of Rossmore, and barring the road forever to the
      rightful earl!
    </p>
    <p>
      "There spoke the real Sellers&mdash;the other had a false ring, old
      friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hawkins, my boy, it just occurs to me&mdash;a thing I keep forgetting to
      mention&mdash;a matter that we've got to be mighty careful about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must keep absolutely still about these materializations. Mind, not a
      hint of them must escape&mdash;not a hint. To say nothing of how my wife
      and daughter&mdash;high-strung, sensitive organizations&mdash;might feel
      about them, the negroes wouldn't stay on the place a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true, they wouldn't. It's well you spoke, for I'm not naturally
      discreet with my tongue when I'm not warned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sellers reached out and touched a bell-button in the wall; set his eye
      upon the rear door and waited; touched it again and waited; and just as
      Hawkins was remarking admiringly that the Colonel was the most progressive
      and most alert man he had ever seen, in the matter of impressing into his
      service every modern convenience the moment it was invented, and always
      keeping breast to breast with the drum major in the great work of material
      civilization, he forsook the button (which hadn't any wire attached to
      it,) rang a vast dinner bell which stood on the table, and remarked that
      he had tried that new-fangled dry battery, now, to his entire
      satisfaction, and had got enough of it; and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing would do Graham Bell but I must try it; said the mere fact of my
      trying it would secure public confidence, and get it a chance to show what
      it could do. I told him that in theory a dry battery was just a curled
      darling and no mistake, but when it come to practice, sho!&mdash;and
      here's the result. Was I right? What should you say, Washington Hawkins?
      You've seen me try that button twice. Was I right?&mdash;that's the idea.
      Did I know what I was talking about, or didn't I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you know how I feel about you, Colonel Sellers, and always have
      felt. It seems to me that you always know everything about everything. If
      that man had known you as I know you he would have taken your judgment at
      the start, and dropped his dry battery where it was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ring, Marse Sellers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Marse Sellers didn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Den it was you, Marse Washington. I's heah, suh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it wasn't Marse Washington, either."
    </p>
    <p>
      "De good lan'! who did ring her, den?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord Rossmore rang it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old negro flung up his hands and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blame my skin if I hain't gone en forgit dat name agin! Come heah, Jinny&mdash;run
      heah, honey."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jinny arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You take dish-yer order de lord gwine to give you I's gwine down suller
      and study dat name tell I git it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take de order! Who's yo' nigger las' year? De bell rung for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dat don't make no diffunce. When a bell ring for anybody, en old marster
      tell me to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clear out, and settle it in the kitchen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of the quarreling presently sank to a murmur in the distance,
      and the earl added: "That's a trouble with old house servants that were
      your slaves once and have been your personal friends always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and members of the family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Members of the family is just what they become&mdash;THE members of the
      family, in fact. And sometimes master and mistress of the household. These
      two are mighty good and loving and faithful and honest, but hang it, they
      do just about as they please, they chip into a conversation whenever they
      want to, and the plain fact is, they ought to be killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a random remark, but it gave him an idea&mdash;however, nothing
      could happen without that result.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I wanted, Hawkins, was to send for the family and break the news to
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, never mind bothering with the servants, then. I will go and bring them
      down."
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was gone, the earl worked his idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said to himself, "when I've got the materializing down to a
      certainty, I will get Hawkins to kill them, and after that they will be
      under better control. Without doubt a materialized negro could easily be
      hypnotized into a state resembling silence. And this could be made
      permanent&mdash;yes, and also modifiable, at will&mdash;sometimes very
      silent, sometimes turn on more talk, more action, more emotion, according
      to what you want. It's a prime good idea. Make it adjustable&mdash;with a
      screw or something."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two ladies entered, now, with Hawkins, and the two negroes followed,
      uninvited, and fell to brushing and dusting around, for they perceived
      that there was matter of interest to the fore, and were willing to find
      out what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sellers broke the news with stateliness and ceremony, first warning the
      ladies, with gentle art, that a pang of peculiar sharpness was about to be
      inflicted upon their hearts&mdash;hearts still sore from a like hurt,
      still lamenting a like loss&mdash;then he took the paper, and with
      trembling lips and with tears in his voice he gave them that heroic
      death-picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was a very genuine outbreak of sorrow and sympathy from all the
      hearers. The elder lady cried, thinking how proud that great-hearted young
      hero's mother would be, if she were living, and how unappeasable her
      grief; and the two old servants cried with her, and spoke out their
      applauses and their pitying lamentations with the eloquent sincerity and
      simplicity native to their race. Gwendolen was touched, and the romantic
      side of her nature was strongly wrought upon. She said that such a nature
      as that young man's was rarely and truly noble, and nearly perfect; and
      that with nobility of birth added it was entirely perfect. For such a man
      she could endure all things, suffer all things, even to the sacrificing of
      her life. She wished she could have seen him; the slightest, the most
      momentary contact with such a spirit would have ennobled her whole
      character and made ignoble thoughts and ignoble acts thereafter impossible
      to her forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have they found the body, Rossmore?" asked the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that is, they've found several. It must be one of them, but none of
      them are recognizable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going down there and identify one of them and send it home to the
      stricken father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But papa, did you ever see the young man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Gwendolen-why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How will you identify it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I&mdash;well, you know it says none of them are recognizable. I'll send
      his father one of them&mdash;there's probably no choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen knew it was not worth while to argue the matter further, since
      her father's mind was made up and there was a chance for him to appear
      upon that sad scene down yonder in an authentic and official way. So she
      said no more&mdash;till he asked for a basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A basket, papa? What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might be ashes."

      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl and Washington started on the sorrowful errand, talking as they
      walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as usual!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Colonel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seven of them in that hotel. Actresses. And all burnt out, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any of them burnt up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no they escaped; they always do; but there's never a one of them that
      knows enough to fetch out her jewelry with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's strange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strange&mdash;it's the most unaccountable thing in the world. Experience
      teaches them nothing; they can't seem to learn anything except out of a
      book. In some cases there's manifestly a fatality about it. For instance,
      take What's-her-name, that plays those sensational thunder and lightning
      parts. She's got a perfectly immense reputation&mdash;draws like a
      dog-fight&mdash;and it all came from getting burnt out in hotels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, how could that give her a reputation as an actress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It didn't&mdash;it only made her name familiar. People want to see her
      play because her name is familiar, but they don't know what made it
      familiar, because they don't remember. First, she was at the bottom of the
      ladder, and absolutely obscure&mdash;wages thirteen dollars a week and
      find her own pads."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pads?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;things to fat up her spindles with so as to be plump and
      attractive. Well, she got burnt out in a hotel and lost $30,000 worth of
      diamonds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She? Where'd she get them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness knows&mdash;given to her, no doubt, by spoony young flats and
      sappy old bald-heads in the front row. All the papers were full of it. She
      struck for higher pay and got it. Well, she got burnt out again and lost
      all her diamonds, and it gave her such a lift that she went starring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if hotel fires are all she's got to depend on to keep up her name,
      it's a pretty precarious kind of a reputation I should think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not with her. No, anything but that. Because she's so lucky; born lucky,
      I reckon. Every time there's a hotel fire she's in it. She's always there&mdash;and
      if she can't be there herself, her diamonds are. Now you can't make
      anything out of that but just sheer luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard of such a thing. She must have lost quarts of diamonds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quarts, she's lost bushels of them. It's got so that the hotels are
      superstitious about her. They won't let her in. They think there will be a
      fire; and besides, if she's there it cancels the insurance. She's been
      waning a little lately, but this fire will set her up. She lost $60,000
      worth last night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think she's a fool. If I had $60,000 worth of diamonds I wouldn't trust
      them in a hotel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't either; but you can't teach an actress that. This one's been
      burnt out thirty-five times. And yet if there's a hotel fire in San
      Francisco to-night she's got to bleed again, you mark my words. Perfect
      ass; they say she's got diamonds in every hotel in the country."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived at the scene of the fire the poor old earl took one
      glimpse at the melancholy morgue and turned away his face overcome by the
      spectacle. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too true, Hawkins&mdash;recognition is impossible, not one of the
      five could be identified by its nearest friend. You make the selection, I
      can't bear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which one had I better&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, take any of them. Pick out the best one."
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the officers assured the earl&mdash;for they knew him, everybody
      in Washington knew him&mdash;that the position in which these bodies were
      found made it impossible that any one of them could be that of his noble
      young kinsman. They pointed out the spot where, if the newspaper account
      was correct, he must have sunk down to destruction; and at a wide distance
      from this spot they showed him where the young man must have gone down in
      case he was suffocated in his room; and they showed still a third place,
      quite remote, where he might possibly have found his death if perchance he
      tried to escape by the side exit toward the rear. The old Colonel brushed
      away a tear and said to Hawkins:
    </p>
    <p>
      "As it turns out there was something prophetic in my fears. Yes, it's a
      matter of ashes. Will you kindly step to a grocery and fetch a couple more
      baskets?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Reverently they got a basket of ashes from each of those now hallowed
      spots, and carried them home to consult as to the best manner of
      forwarding them to England, and also to give them an opportunity to "lie
      in state,"&mdash;a mark of respect which the colonel deemed obligatory,
      considering the high rank of the deceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set the baskets on the table in what was formerly the library,
      drawing-room and workshop&mdash;now the Hall of Audience&mdash;and went up
      stairs to the lumber room to see if they could find a British flag to use
      as a part of the outfit proper to the lying in state. A moment later, Lady
      Rossmore came in from the street and caught sight of the baskets just as
      old Jinny crossed her field of vision. She quite lost her patience and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what will you do next? What in the world possessed you to clutter
      up the parlor table with these baskets of ashes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ashes?" And she came to look. She put up her hands in pathetic
      astonishment. "Well, I never see de like!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Didn't you do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, me? Clah to goodness it's de fust time I've sot eyes on 'em, Miss
      Polly. Dat's Dan'l. Dat ole moke is losin' his mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="p088" id="p088"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img alt="p088.jpg (16K)" src="images/p088.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But it wasn't Dan'l, for he was called, and denied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dey ain't no way to 'splain dat. Wen hit's one er dese-yer common
      'currences, a body kin reckon maybe de cat&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" and a shudder shook Lady Rossmore to her foundations. "I see it all.
      Keep away from them&mdash;they're his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His, m' lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;your young Marse Sellers from England that's burnt up."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was alone with the ashes&mdash;alone before she could take half a
      breath. Then she went after Mulberry Sellers, purposing to make short work
      of his program, whatever it might be; "for," said she, "when his
      sentimentals are up, he's a numskull, and there's no knowing what
      extravagance he'll contrive, if you let him alone." She found him. He had
      found the flag and was bringing it. When she heard that his idea was to
      have the remains "lie in state, and invite the government and the public,"
      she broke it up. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your intentions are all right&mdash;they always are&mdash;you want to do
      honour to the remains, and surely nobody can find any fault with that, for
      he was your kin; but you are going the wrong way about it, and you will
      see it yourself if you stop and think. You can't file around a basket of
      ashes trying to look sorry for it and make a sight that is really solemn,
      because the solemner it is, the more it isn't&mdash;anybody can see that.
      It would be so with one basket; it would be three times so with three.
      Well, it stands to reason that if it wouldn't be solemn with one mourner,
      it wouldn't be with a procession&mdash;and there would be five thousand
      people here. I don't know but it would be pretty near ridiculous; I think
      it would. No, Mulberry, they can't lie in state&mdash;it would be a
      mistake. Give that up and think of something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      So he gave it up; and not reluctantly, when he had thought it over and
      realized how right her instinct was. He concluded to merely sit up with
      the remains just himself and Hawkins. Even this seemed a doubtful
      attention, to his wife, but she offered no objection, for it was plain
      that he had a quite honest and simple-hearted desire to do the friendly
      and honourable thing by these forlorn poor relics which could command no
      hospitality in this far off land of strangers but his. He draped the flag
      about the baskets, put some crape on the door-knob, and said with
      satisfaction:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There&mdash;he is as comfortable, now, as we can make him in the
      circumstances. Except&mdash;yes, we must strain a point there&mdash;one
      must do as one would wish to be done by&mdash;he must have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have what, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hatchment."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife felt that the house-front was standing about all it could well
      stand, in that way; the prospect of another stunning decoration of that
      nature distressed her, and she wished the thing had not occurred to him.
      She said, hesitatingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought such an honour as that wasn't allowed to any but very very
      near relations, who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right, you are quite right, my lady, perfectly right; but there aren't
      any nearer relatives than relatives by usurpation. We cannot avoid it; we
      are slaves of aristocratic custom and must submit."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hatchments were unnecessarily generous, each being as large as a
      blanket, and they were unnecessarily volcanic, too, as to variety and
      violence of color, but they pleased the earl's barbaric eye, and they
      satisfied his taste for symmetry and completeness, too, for they left no
      waste room to speak of on the house-front.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Rossmore and her daughter assisted at the sitting-up till near
      midnight, and helped the gentlemen to consider what ought to be done next
      with the remains. Rossmore thought they ought to be sent home with a
      committee and resolutions,&mdash;at once. But the wife was doubtful. She
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you send all of the baskets?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All at once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To his father? Oh, no&mdash;by no means. Think of the shock. No&mdash;one
      at a time; break it to him by degrees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would that have that effect, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my daughter. Remember, you are young and elastic, but he is old. To
      send him the whole at once might well be more than he could bear. But
      mitigated&mdash;one basket at a time, with restful intervals between, he
      would be used to it by the time he got all of him. And sending him in
      three ships is safer anyway. On account of wrecks and storms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like the idea, father. If I were his father it would be dreadful
      to have him coming in that&mdash;in that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the installment plan," suggested Hawkins, gravely, and proud of being
      able to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;dreadful to have him coming in that incoherent way. There would
      be the strain of suspense upon me all the time. To have so depressing a
      thing as a funeral impending, delayed, waiting, unaccomplished&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, my child," said the earl reassuringly, "there would be nothing of
      that kind; so old a gentleman could not endure a long-drawn suspense like
      that. There will be three funerals."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Rossmore looked up surprised, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is that going to make it easier for him? It's a total mistake, to my
      mind. He ought to be buried all at once; I'm sure of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so, too," said Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And certainly I should," said the daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are all wrong," said the earl. "You will see it yourselves, if you
      think. Only one of these baskets has got him in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then," said Lady Rossmore, "the thing is perfectly simple&mdash;bury
      that one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said Lady Gwendolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is not simple," said the earl, "because we do not know which
      basket he is in. We know he is in one of them, but that is all we do know.
      You see now, I reckon, that I was right; it takes three funerals, there is
      no other way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And three graves and three monuments and three inscriptions?" asked the
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;yes&mdash;to do it right. That is what I should do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It could not be done so, father. Each of the inscriptions would give the
      same name and the same facts and say he was under each and all of these
      monuments, and that would not answer at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl nestled uncomfortably in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said, "that is an objection. That is a serious objection. I see
      no way out."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general silence for a while. Then Hawkins said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me that if we mixed the three ramifications together&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl grasped him by the hand and shook it gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It solves the whole problem," he said. "One ship, one funeral, one grave,
      one monument&mdash;it is admirably conceived. It does you honor, Major
      Hawkins, it has relieved me of a most painful embarrassment and distress,
      and it will save that poor stricken old father much suffering. Yes, he
      shall go over in one basket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When?" asked the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow-immediately, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would wait, Mulberry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait? Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't want to break that childless old man's heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows I don't!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then wait till he sends for his son's remains. If you do that, you will
      never have to give him the last and sharpest pain a parent can know&mdash;I
      mean, the certainty that his son is dead. For he will never send."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why won't he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because to send&mdash;and find out the truth&mdash;would rob him of the
      one precious thing left him, the uncertainty, the dim hope that maybe,
      after all, his boy escaped, and he will see him again some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why Polly, he'll know by the papers that he was burnt up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He won't let himself believe the papers; he'll argue against anything and
      everything that proves his son is dead; and he will keep that up and live
      on it, and on nothing else till he dies. But if the remains should
      actually come, and be put before that poor old dim-hoping soul&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my God, they never shall! Polly, you've saved me from a crime, and
      I'll bless you for it always. Now we know what to do. We'll place them
      reverently away, and he shall never know."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Lord Berkeley, with the fresh air of freedom in his nostrils,
      was feeling invincibly strong for his new career; and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;if
      the fight should prove a very hard one at first, very discouraging, very
      taxing on untoughened moral sinews, he might in some weak moment want to
      retreat. Not likely, of course, but possibly that might happen. And so on
      the whole it might be pardonable caution to burn his bridges behind him.
      Oh, without doubt. He must not stop with advertising for the owner of that
      money, but must put it where he could not borrow from it himself,
      meantime, under stress of circumstances. So he went down town, and put in
      his advertisement, then went to a bank and handed in $500 for deposit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated and colored a little; he had forgotten to make a selection.
      He now brought out the first one that suggested itself:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Howard Tracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone the clerks, marveling, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cowboy blushed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step was accomplished. The money was still under his command and
      at his disposal, but the next step would dispose of that difficulty. He
      went to another bank and drew upon the first bank for the $500 by check.
      The money was collected and deposited a second time to the credit of
      Howard Tracy. He was asked to leave a few samples of his signature, which
      he did. Then he went away, once more proud and of perfect courage, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No help for me now, for henceforth I couldn't draw that money without
      identification, and that is become legally impossible. No resources to
      fall back on. It is work or starve from now to the end. I am ready&mdash;and
      not afraid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sent this cablegram to his father:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Escaped unhurt from burning hotel. Have taken fictitious name. Goodbye."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the evening while he was wandering about in one of the outlying
      districts of the city, he came across a small brick church, with a bill
      posted there with these words printed on it: "MECHANICS' CLUB DEBATE. ALL
      INVITED." He saw people, apparently mainly of the working class, entering
      the place, and he followed and took his seat. It was a humble little
      church, quite bare as to ornamentation. It had painted pews without
      cushions, and no pulpit, properly speaking, but it had a platform. On the
      platform sat the chairman, and by his side sat a man who held a manuscript
      in his hand and had the waiting look of one who is going to perform the
      principal part. The church was soon filled with a quiet and orderly
      congregation of decently dressed and modest people. This is what the
      chairman said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The essayist for this evening is an old member of our club whom you all
      know, Mr. Parker, assistant editor of the Daily Democrat. The subject of
      his essay is the American Press, and he will use as his text a couple of
      paragraphs taken from Mr. Matthew Arnold's new book. He asks me to read
      these texts for him. The first is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Goethe says somewhere that "the thrill of awe," that is to say,
      REVERENCE, is the best thing humanity has."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Arnold's other paragraph is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I should say that if one were searching for the best means to efface and
      kill in a whole nation the discipline of respect, one could not do better
      than take the American newspapers."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="p095" id="p095"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img alt="p095.jpg (18K)" src="images/p095.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Parker rose and bowed, and was received with warm applause. He then
      began to read in a good round resonant voice, with clear enunciation and
      careful attention to his pauses and emphases. His points were received
      with approval as he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The essayist took the position that the most important function of a
      public journal in any country was the propagating of national feeling and
      pride in the national name&mdash;the keeping the people "in love with
      their country and its institutions, and shielded from the allurements of
      alien and inimical systems." He sketched the manner in which the reverent
      Turkish or Russian journalist fulfilled this function&mdash;the one
      assisted by the prevalent "discipline of respect" for the bastinado, the
      other for Siberia. Continuing, he said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The chief function of an English journal is that of all other journals
        the world over: it must keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon
        certain things, and keep it diligently diverted from certain others. For
        instance, it must keep the public eye fixed admiringly upon the glories
        of England, a processional splendor stretching its receding line down
        the hazy vistas of time, with the mellowed lights of a thousand years
        glinting from its banners; and it must keep it diligently diverted from
        the fact that all these glories were for the enrichment and
        aggrandizement of the petted and privileged few, at cost of the blood
        and sweat and poverty of the unconsidered masses who achieved them but
        might not enter in and partake of them. It must keep the public eye
        fixed in loving and awful reverence upon the throne as a sacred thing,
        and diligently divert it from the fact that no throne was ever set up by
        the unhampered vote of a majority of any nation; and that hence no
        throne exists that has a right to exist, and no symbol of it, flying
        from any flagstaff, is righteously entitled to wear any device but the
        skull and crossbones of that kindred industry which differs from royalty
        only business-wise&mdash;merely as retail differs from wholesale. It
        must keep the citizen's eye fixed in reverent docility upon that curious
        invention of machine politics, an Established Church, and upon that bald
        contradiction of common justice, a hereditary nobility; and diligently
        divert it from the fact that the one damns him if he doesn't wear its
        collar, and robs him under the gentle name of taxation whether he wears
        it or not, and the other gets all the honors while he does all the work.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The essayist thought that Mr. Arnold, with his trained eye and intelligent
      observation, ought to have perceived that the very quality which he so
      regretfully missed from our press&mdash;respectfulness, reverence &mdash;was
      exactly the thing which would make our press useless to us if it had it&mdash;rob
      it of the very thing which differentiates it from all other journalism in
      the world and makes it distinctively and preciously American, its frank
      and cheerful irreverence being by all odds the most valuable of all its
      qualities. "For its mission&mdash;overlooked by Mr. Arnold&mdash;is to
      stand guard over a nation's liberties, not its humbugs and shams." He
      thought that if during fifty years the institutions of the old world could
      be exposed to the fire of a flouting and scoffing press like ours,
      "monarchy and its attendant crimes would disappear from Christendom."
      Monarchists might doubt this; then "why not persuade the Czar to give it a
      trial in Russia?" Concluding, he said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Well, the charge is, that our press has but little of that old world
        quality, reverence. Let us be candidly grateful that it is so. With its
        limited reverence it at least reveres the things which this nation
        reveres, as a rule, and that is sufficient: what other people revere is
        fairly and properly matter of light importance to us. Our press does not
        reverence kings, it does not reverence so called nobilities, it does not
        reverence established ecclesiastical slaveries, it does not reverence
        laws which rob a younger son to fatten an elder one, it does not
        reverence any fraud or sham or infamy, howsoever old or rotten or holy,
        which sets one citizen above his neighbor by accident of birth: it does
        not reverence any law or custom, howsoever old or decayed or sacred,
        which shuts against the best man in the land the best place in the land
        and the divine right to prove property and go up and occupy it. In the
        sense of the poet Goethe&mdash;that meek idolater of provincial three
        carat royalty and nobility&mdash;our press is certainly bankrupt in the
        "thrill of awe"&mdash;otherwise reverence; reverence for nickel plate
        and brummagem. Let us sincerely hope that this fact will remain a fact
        forever: for to my mind a discriminating irreverence is the creator and
        protector of human liberty&mdash;even as the other thing is the creator,
        nurse, and steadfast protector of all forms of human slavery, bodily and
        mental.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Tracy said to himself, almost shouted to himself, "I'm glad I came to this
      country. I was right. I was right to seek out a land where such healthy
      principles and theories are in men's hearts and minds. Think of the
      innumerable slaveries imposed by misplaced reverence! How well he brought
      that out, and how true it is. There's manifestly prodigious force in
      reverence. If you can get a man to reverence your ideals, he's your slave.
      Oh, yes, in all the ages the peoples of Europe have been diligently taught
      to avoid reasoning about the shams of monarchy and nobility, been taught
      to avoid examining them, been taught to reverence them; and now, as a
      natural result, to reverence them is second nature. In order to shock them
      it is sufficient to inject a thought of the opposite kind into their dull
      minds. For ages, any expression of so-called irreverence from their lips
      has been sin and crime. The sham and swindle of all this is apparent the
      moment one reflects that he is himself the only legitimately qualified
      judge of what is entitled to reverence and what is not. Come, I hadn't
      thought of that before, but it is true, absolutely true. What right has
      Goethe, what right has Arnold, what right has any dictionary, to define
      the word Irreverence for me? What their ideals are is nothing to me. So
      long as I reverence my own ideals my whole duty is done, and I commit no
      profanation if I laugh at theirs. I may scoff at other people's ideals as
      much as I want to. It is my right and my privilege. No man has any right
      to deny it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy was expecting to hear the essay debated, but this did not happen.
      The chairman said, by way of explanation:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would say, for the information of the strangers present here, that in
      accordance with our custom the subject of this meeting will be debated at
      the next meeting of the club. This is in order to enable our members to
      prepare what they may wish to say upon the subject with pen and paper, for
      we are mainly mechanics and unaccustomed to speaking. We are obliged to
      write down what we desire to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Many brief papers were now read, and several offhand speeches made in
      discussion of the essay read at the last meeting of the club, which had
      been a laudation, by some visiting professor, of college culture, and the
      grand results flowing from it to the nation. One of the papers was read by
      a man approaching middle age, who said he hadn't had a college education,
      that he had got his education in a printing office, and had graduated from
      there into the patent office, where he had been a clerk now for a great
      many years. Then he continued to this effect:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The essayist contrasted the America of to-day with the America of bygone
        times, and certainly the result is the exhibition of a mighty progress.
        But I think he a little overrated the college-culture share in the
        production of that result. It can no doubt be easily shown that the
        colleges have contributed the intellectual part of this progress, and
        that that part is vast; but that the material progress has been
        immeasurably vaster, I think you will concede. Now I have been looking
        over a list of inventors&mdash;the creators of this amazing material
        development&mdash;and I find that they were not college-bred men. Of
        course there are exceptions&mdash;like Professor Henry of Princeton, the
        inventor of Mr. Morse's system of telegraphy&mdash;but these exceptions
        are few. It is not overstatement to say that the imagination-stunning
        material development of this century, the only century worth living in
        since time itself was invented, is the creation of men not college-bred.
        We think we see what these inventors have done: no, we see only the
        visible vast frontage of their work; behind it is their far vaster work,
        and it is invisible to the careless glance. They have reconstructed this
        nation&mdash;made it over, that is&mdash;and metaphorically speaking,
        have multiplied its numbers almost beyond the power of figures to
        express. I will explain what I mean. What constitutes the population of
        a land? Merely the numberable packages of meat and bones in it called by
        courtesy men and women? Shall a million ounces of brass and a million
        ounces of gold be held to be of the same value? Take a truer standard:
        the measure of a man's contributing capacity to his time and his people&mdash;the
        work he can do&mdash;and then number the population of this country
        to-day, as multiplied by what a man can now do, more than his
        grandfather could do. By this standard of measurement, this nation, two
        or three generations ago, consisted of mere cripples, paralytics, dead
        men, as compared with the men of to-day. In 1840 our population was
        17,000,000. By way of rude but striking illustration, let us consider,
        for argument's sake, that four of these millions consisted of aged
        people, little children, and other incapables, and that the remaining
        13,000,000 were divided and employed as follows:

        Now the deductions which I am going to append to these figures may sound
        extravagant, but they are not. I take them from Miscellaneous Documents
        No. 50, second session 45th Congress, and they are official and
        trustworthy. To-day, the work of those 2,000,000 cotton-ginners is done
        by 2,000 men; that of the 6,000,000 stocking-knitters is done by 3,000
        boys; that of the 2,000,000 thread-spinners is done by 1,000 girls; that

      "How grand that is!" said Tracy, as he wended homeward. "What a
      civilization it is, and what prodigious results these are! and brought
      about almost wholly by common men; not by Oxford-trained aristocrats, but
      men who stand shoulder to shoulder in the humble ranks of life and earn
      the bread that they eat. Again, I'm glad I came. I have found a country at
      last where one may start fair, and breast to breast with his fellow man,
      rise by his own efforts, and be something in the world and be proud of

      CHAPTER XI.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      During the first few days he kept the fact diligently before his mind that
      he was in a land where there was "work and bread for all." In fact, for
      convenience' sake he fitted it to a little tune and hummed it to himself;
      but as time wore on the fact itself began to take on a doubtful look, and
      next the tune got fatigued and presently ran down and stopped. His first
      effort was to get an upper clerkship in one of the departments, where his
      Oxford education could come into play and do him service. But he stood no
      chance whatever. There, competency was no recommendation; political
      backing, without competency, was worth six of it. He was glaringly
      English, and that was necessarily against him in the political centre of a
      nation where both parties prayed for the Irish cause on the house-top and
      blasphemed it in the cellar. By his dress he was a cowboy; that won him
      respect&mdash;when his back was not turned&mdash;but it couldn't get a
      clerkship for him. But he had said, in a rash moment, that he would wear
      those clothes till the owner or the owner's friends caught sight of them
      and asked for that money, and his conscience would not let him retire from
      that engagement now.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a week things were beginning to wear rather a startling
      look. He had hunted everywhere for work, descending gradually the scale of
      quality, until apparently he had sued for all the various kinds of work a
      man without a special calling might hope to be able to do, except ditching
      and the other coarse manual sorts&mdash;and had got neither work nor the
      promise of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was mechanically turning over the leaves of his diary, meanwhile, and
      now his eye fell upon the first record made after he was burnt out:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "I myself did not doubt my stamina before, nobody could doubt it now, if
        they could see how I am housed, and realise that I feel absolutely no
        disgust with these quarters, but am as serenely content with them as any
        dog would be in a similar kennel. Terms, twenty-five dollars a week. I
        said I would start at the bottom. I have kept my word."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A shudder went quaking through him, and he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have I been thinking of! THIS the bottom! Mooning along a whole
      week, and these terrific expenses climbing and climbing all the time! I
      must end this folly straightway."
    </p>
    <p>
      He settled up at once and went forth to find less sumptuous lodgings. He
      had to wander far and seek with diligence, but he succeeded. They made him
      pay in advance&mdash;four dollars and a half; this secured both bed and
      food for a week. The good-natured, hardworked landlady took him up three
      flights of narrow, uncarpeted stairs and delivered him into his room.
      There were two double-bedsteads in it, and one single one. He would be
      allowed to sleep alone in one of the double beds until some new boarder
      should come, but he wouldn't be charged extra.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he would presently be required to sleep with some stranger! The thought
      of it made him sick. Mrs. Marsh, the landlady, was very friendly and hoped
      he would like her house&mdash;they all liked it, she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And they're a very nice set of boys. They carry on a good deal, but
      that's their fun. You see, this room opens right into this back one, and
      sometimes they're all in one and sometimes in the other; and hot nights
      they all sleep on the roof when it don't rain. They get out there the
      minute it's hot enough. The season's so early that they've already had a
      night or two up there. If you'd like to go up and pick out a place, you
      can. You'll find chalk in the side of the chimney where there's a brick
      wanting. You just take the chalk and&mdash;but of course you've done it
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, I haven't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, of course you haven't&mdash;what am I thinking of? Plenty of room on
      the Plains without chalking, I'll be bound. Well, you just chalk out a
      place the size of a blanket anywhere on the tin that ain't already marked
      off, you know, and that's your property. You and your bed-mate take
      turnabout carrying up the blanket and pillows and fetching them down
      again; or one carries them up and the other fetches them down, you fix it
      the way you like, you know. You'll like the boys, they're everlasting
      sociable&mdash;except the printer. He's the one that sleeps in that single
      bed&mdash;the strangest creature; why, I don't believe you could get that
      man to sleep with another man, not if the house was afire. Mind you, I'm
      not just talking, I know. The boys tried him, to see. They took his bed
      out one night, and so when he got home about three in the morning&mdash;he
      was on a morning paper then, but he's on an evening one now&mdash;there
      wasn't any place for him but with the iron-moulder; and if you'll believe
      me, he just set up the rest of the night&mdash;he did, honest. They say
      he's cracked, but it ain't so, he's English&mdash;they're awful
      particular. You won't mind my saying that. You&mdash;you're English?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so. I could tell it by the way you mispronounce the words
      that's got a's in them, you know; such as saying loff when you mean laff
      &mdash;but you'll get over that. He's a right down good fellow, and a
      little sociable with the photographer's boy and the caulker and the
      blacksmith that work in the navy yard, but not so much with the others.
      The fact is, though it's private, and the others don't know it, he's a
      kind of an aristocrat, his father being a doctor, and you know what style
      that is&mdash;in England, I mean, because in this country a doctor ain't
      so very much, even if he's that. But over there of course it's different.
      So this chap had a falling out with his father, and was pretty high
      strung, and just cut for this country, and the first he knew he had to get
      to work or starve. Well, he'd been to college, you see, and so he judged
      he was all right&mdash;did you say anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I only sighed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there's where he was mistaken. Why, he mighty near starved. And I
      reckon he would have starved sure enough, if some jour' printer or other
      hadn't took pity on him and got him a place as apprentice. So he learnt
      the trade, and then he was all right&mdash;but it was a close call. Once
      he thought he had got to haul in his pride and holler for his father and&mdash;why,
      you're sighing again. Is anything the matter with you?&mdash;does my
      clatter&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear&mdash;no. Pray go on&mdash;I like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you see, he's been over here ten years; he's twenty-eight, now, and
      he ain't pretty well satisfied in his mind, because he can't get
      reconciled to being a mechanic and associating with mechanics, he being,
      as he says to me, a gentleman, which is a pretty plain letting-on that the
      boys ain't, but of course I know enough not to let that cat out of the
      bag."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;would there be any harm in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harm in it? They'd lick him, wouldn't they? Wouldn't you? Of course you
      would. Don't you ever let a man say you ain't a gentleman in this country.
      But laws, what am I thinking about? I reckon a body would think twice
      before he said a cowboy wasn't a gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      A trim, active, slender and very pretty girl of about eighteen walked into
      the room now, in the most satisfied and unembarrassed way. She was cheaply
      but smartly and gracefully dressed, and the mother's quick glance at the
      stranger's face as he rose, was of the kind which inquires what effect has
      been produced, and expects to find indications of surprise and admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is my daughter Hattie&mdash;we call her Puss. It's the new boarder,
      Puss." This without rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young Englishman made the awkward bow common to his nationality and
      time of life in circumstances of delicacy and difficulty, and these were
      of that sort; for, being taken by surprise, his natural, lifelong self
      sprang to the front, and that self of course would not know just how to
      act when introduced to a chambermaid, or to the heiress of a mechanics'
      boarding house. His other self&mdash;the self which recognized the
      equality of all men&mdash;would have managed the thing better, if it
      hadn't been caught off guard and robbed of its chance. The young girl paid
      no attention to the bow, but put out her hand frankly and gave the
      stranger a friendly shake and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="p109" id="p109"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img alt="p109.jpg (23K)" src="images/p109.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she marched to the one washstand in the room, tilted her head this
      way and that before the wreck of a cheap mirror that hung above it,
      dampened her fingers with her tongue, perfected the circle of a little
      lock of hair that was pasted against her forehead, then began to busy
      herself with the slops.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I must be going&mdash;it's getting towards supper time. Make
      yourself at home, Mr. Tracy, you'll hear the bell when it's ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlady took her tranquil departure, without commanding either of the
      young people to vacate the room. The young man wondered a little that a
      mother who seemed so honest and respectable should be so thoughtless, and
      was reaching for his hat, intending to disembarrass the girl of his
      presence; but she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;nowhere in particular, but as I am only in the way here&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, who said you were in the way? Sit down&mdash;I'll move you when you
      are in the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was making the beds, now. He sat down and watched her deft and
      diligent performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What gave you that notion? Do you reckon I need a whole room just to make
      up a bed or two in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well no, it wasn't that, exactly. We are away up here in an empty house,
      and your mother being gone&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl interrupted him with an amused laugh, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nobody to protect me? Bless you, I don't need it. I'm not afraid. I might
      be if I was alone, because I do hate ghosts, and I don't deny it. Not that
      I believe in them, for I don't. I'm only just afraid of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you be afraid of them if you don't believe in them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know the how of it&mdash;that's too many for me; I only know
      it's so. It's the same with Maggie Lee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the boarders; young lady that works in the fact'ry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She works in a factory?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Shoe factory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a shoe factory; and you call her a young lady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, she's only twenty-two; what should you call her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wasn't thinking of her age, I was thinking of the title. The fact is, I
      came away from England to get away from artificial forms&mdash;for
      artificial forms suit artificial people only&mdash;and here you've got
      them too. I'm sorry. I hoped you had only men and women; everybody equal;
      no differences in rank."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stopped with a pillow in her teeth and the case spread open below
      it, contemplating him from under her brows with a slightly puzzled
      expression. She released the pillow and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, they are all equal. Where's any difference in rank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you call a factory girl a young lady, what do you call the President's
      wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call her an old one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you make age the only distinction?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There ain't any other to make as far as I can see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then all women are ladies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly they are. All the respectable ones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that puts a better face on it. Certainly there is no harm in a
      title when it is given to everybody. It is only an offense and a wrong
      when it is restricted to a favored few. But Miss&mdash;er&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hattie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miss Hattie, be frank; confess that that title isn't accorded by
      everybody to everybody. The rich American doesn't call her cook a lady&mdash;isn't
      that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's so. What of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised and a little disappointed, to see that his admirable shot
      had produced no perceptible effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What of it?" he said. "Why this: equality is not conceded here, after
      all, and the Americans are no better off than the English. In fact there's
      no difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now what an idea. There's nothing in a title except what is put into it&mdash;you've
      said that yourself. Suppose the title is 'clean,' instead of 'lady.' You
      get that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so. Instead of speaking of a woman as a lady, you substitute
      clean and say she's a clean person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it. In England the swell folks don't speak of the working people
      as gentlemen and ladies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the working people don't call themselves gentlemen and ladies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So if you used the other word there wouldn't be any change. The swell
      people wouldn't call anybody but themselves 'clean,' and those others
      would drop sort of meekly into their way of talking and they wouldn't call
      themselves clean. We don't do that way here. Everybody calls himself a
      lady or gentleman, and thinks he is, and don't care what anybody else
      thinks him, so long as he don't say it out loud. You think there's no
      difference. You knuckle down and we don't. Ain't that a difference?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a difference I hadn't thought of; I admit that. Still&mdash;calling
      one's self a lady doesn't&mdash;er&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wouldn't go on if I were you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Howard Tracy turned his head to see who it might be that had introduced
      this remark. It was a short man about forty years old, with sandy hair, no
      beard, and a pleasant face badly freckled but alive and intelligent, and
      he wore slop-shop clothing which was neat but showed wear. He had come
      from the front room beyond the hall, where he had left his hat, and he had
      a chipped and cracked white wash-bowl in his hand. The girl came and took
      the bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll get it for you. You go right ahead and give it to him, Mr. Barrow.
      He's the new boarder&mdash;Mr. Tracy&mdash;and I'd just got to where it
      was getting too deep for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much obliged if you will, Hattie. I was coming to borrow of the boys." He
      sat down at his ease on an old trunk, and said, "I've been listening and
      got interested; and as I was saying, I wouldn't go on, if I were you. You
      see where you are coming to, don't you? Calling yourself a lady doesn't
      elect you; that is what you were going to say; and you saw that if you
      said it you were going to run right up against another difference that you
      hadn't thought of: to-wit, Whose right is it to do the electing? Over
      there, twenty thousand people in a million elect themselves gentlemen and
      ladies, and the nine hundred and eighty thousand accept that decree and
      swallow the affront which it puts upon them. Why, if they didn't accept
      it, it wouldn't be an election, it would be a dead letter and have no
      force at all. Over here the twenty thousand would-be exclusives come up to
      the polls and vote themselves to be ladies and gentlemen. But the thing
      doesn't stop there. The nine hundred and eighty thousand come and vote
      themselves to be ladies and gentlemen too, and that elects the whole
      nation. Since the whole million vote themselves ladies and gentlemen,
      there is no question about that election. It does make absolute equality,
      and there is no fiction about it; while over yonder the inequality, (by
      decree of the infinitely feeble, and consent of the infinitely strong,) is
      also absolute&mdash;as real and absolute as our equality."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy had shrunk promptly into his English shell when this speech began,
      notwithstanding he had now been in severe training several weeks for
      contact and intercourse with the common herd on the common herd's terms;
      but he lost no time in pulling himself out again, and so by the time the
      speech was finished his valves were open once more, and he was forcing
      himself to accept without resentment the common herd's frank fashion of
      dropping sociably into other people's conversations unembarrassed and
      uninvited. The process was not very difficult this time, for the man's
      smile and voice and manner were persuasive and winning. Tracy would even
      have liked him on the spot, but for the fact&mdash;fact which he was not
      really aware of&mdash;that the equality of men was not yet a reality to
      him, it was only a theory; the mind perceived, but the man failed to feel
      it. It was Hattie's ghost over again, merely turned around. Theoretically
      Barrow was his equal, but it was distinctly distasteful to see him exhibit
      it. He presently said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope in all sincerity that what you have said is true, as regards the
      Americans, for doubts have crept into my mind several times. It seemed
      that the equality must be ungenuine where the sign-names of castes were
      still in vogue; but those sign-names have certainly lost their offence and
      are wholly neutralized, nullified and harmless if they are the undisputed
      property of every individual in the nation. I think I realize that caste
      does not exist and cannot exist except by common consent of the masses
      outside of its limits. I thought caste created itself and perpetuated
      itself; but it seems quite true that it only creates itself, and is
      perpetuated by the people whom it despises, and who can dissolve it at any
      time by assuming its mere sign-names themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's what I think. There isn't any power on earth that can prevent
      England's thirty millions from electing themselves dukes and duchesses
      to-morrow and calling themselves so. And within six months all the former
      dukes and duchesses would have retired from the business. I wish they'd
      try that. Royalty itself couldn't survive such a process. A handful of
      frowners against thirty million laughers in a state of irruption. Why,
      it's Herculaneum against Vesuvius; it would take another eighteen
      centuries to find that Herculaneum after the cataclysm. What's a Colonel
      in our South? He's a nobody; because they're all colonels down there. No,
      Tracy" (shudder from Tracy) "nobody in England would call you a gentleman
      and you wouldn't call yourself one; and I tell you it's a state of things
      that makes a man put himself into most unbecoming attitudes sometimes&mdash;the
      broad and general recognition and acceptance of caste as caste does, I
      mean. Makes him do it unconsciously&mdash;being bred in him, you see, and
      never thought over and reasoned out. You couldn't conceive of the
      Matterhorn being flattered by the notice of one of your comely little
      English hills, could you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, let a man in his right mind try to conceive of Darwin feeling
      flattered by the notice of a princess. It's so grotesque that it&mdash;well,
      it paralyzes the imagination. Yet that Memnon was flattered by the notice
      of that statuette; he says so&mdash;says so himself. The system that can
      make a god disown his godship and profane it&mdash;oh, well, it's all
      wrong, it's all wrong and ought to be abolished, I should say."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mention of Darwin brought on a literary discussion, and this topic
      roused such enthusiasm in Barrow that he took off his coat and made
      himself the more free and comfortable for it, and detained him so long
      that he was still at it when the noisy proprietors of the room came
      shouting and skylarking in and began to romp, scuffle, wash, and otherwise
      entertain themselves. He lingered yet a little longer to offer the
      hospitalities of his room and his book shelf to Tracy and ask him a
      personal question or two:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your trade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They&mdash;well, they call me a cowboy, but that is a fancy. I'm not
      that. I haven't any trade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you work at for your living?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, anything&mdash;I mean I would work at, anything I could get to do,
      but thus far I haven't been able to find an occupation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe I can help you; I'd like to try."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be very glad. I've tried, myself, to weariness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, of course where a man hasn't a regular trade he's pretty bad off in
      this world. What you needed, I reckon, was less book learning and more
      bread-and-butter learning. I don't know what your father could have been
      thinking of. You ought to have had a trade, you ought to have had a trade,
      by all means. But never mind about that; we'll stir up something to do, I
      guess. And don't you get homesick; that's a bad business. We'll talk the
      thing over and look around a little. You'll come out all right. Wait for
      me&mdash;I'll go down to supper with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Tracy had achieved a very friendly feeling for Barrow and
      would have called him a friend, maybe, if not taken too suddenly on a
      straight-out requirement to realize on his theories. He was glad of his
      society, anyway, and was feeling lighter hearted than before. Also he was
      pretty curious to know what vocation it might be which had furnished
      Barrow such a large acquaintanceship with books and allowed him so much
      time to read.

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the supper bell began to ring in the depths of the house, and
      the sound proceeded steadily upward, growing in intensity all the way up
      towards the upper floors. The higher it came the more maddening was the
      noise, until at last what it lacked of being absolutely deafening, was
      made up of the sudden crash and clatter of an avalanche of boarders down
      the uncarpeted stairway. The peerage did not go to meals in this fashion;
      Tracy's training had not fitted him to enjoy this hilarious zoological
      clamor and enthusiasm. He had to confess that there was something about
      this extraordinary outpouring of animal spirits which he would have to get
      inured to before he could accept it. No doubt in time he would prefer it;
      but he wished the process might be modified and made just a little more
      gradual, and not quite so pronounced and violent. Barrow and Tracy
      followed the avalanche down through an ever increasing and ever more and
      more aggressive stench of bygone cabbage and kindred smells; smells which
      are to be found nowhere but in a cheap private boarding house; smells
      which once encountered can never be forgotten; smells which encountered
      generations later are instantly recognizable, but never recognizable with
      pleasure. To Tracy these odors were suffocating, horrible, almost
      unendurable; but he held his peace and said nothing. Arrived in the
      basement, they entered a large dining-room where thirty-five or forty
      people sat at a long table. They took their places. The feast had already
      begun and the conversation was going on in the liveliest way from one end
      of the table to the other. The table cloth was of very coarse material and
      was liberally spotted with coffee stains and grease. The knives and forks
      were iron, with bone handles, the spoons appeared to be iron or sheet iron
      or something of the sort. The tea and coffee cups were of the commonest
      and heaviest and most durable stone ware. All the furniture of the table
      was of the commonest and cheapest sort. There was a single large thick
      slice of bread by each boarder's plate, and it was observable that he
      economized it as if he were not expecting it to be duplicated. Dishes of
      butter were distributed along the table within reach of people's arms, if
      they had long ones, but there were no private butter plates. The butter
      was perhaps good enough, and was quiet and well behaved; but it had more
      bouquet than was necessary, though nobody commented upon that fact or
      seemed in any way disturbed by it. The main feature of the feast was a
      piping hot Irish stew made of the potatoes and meat left over from a
      procession of previous meals. Everybody was liberally supplied with this
      dish. On the table were a couple of great dishes of sliced ham, and there
      were some other eatables of minor importance&mdash;preserves and New
      Orleans molasses and such things. There was also plenty of tea and coffee
      of an infernal sort, with brown sugar and condensed milk, but the milk and
      sugar supply was not left at the discretion of the boarders, but was
      rationed out at headquarters&mdash;one spoonful of sugar and one of
      condensed milk to each cup and no more. The table was waited upon by two
      stalwart negro women who raced back and forth from the bases of supplies
      with splendid dash and clatter and energy. Their labors were supplemented
      after a fashion by the young girl Puss. She carried coffee and tea back
      and forth among the boarders, but she made pleasure excursions rather than
      business ones in this way, to speak strictly. She made jokes with various
      people. She chaffed the young men pleasantly and wittily, as she supposed,
      and as the rest also supposed, apparently, judging by the applause and
      laughter which she got by her efforts. Manifestly she was a favorite with
      most of the young fellows and sweetheart of the rest of them. Where she
      conferred notice she conferred happiness, as was seen by the face of the
      recipient; and at the same time she conferred unhappiness&mdash;one could
      see it fall and dim the faces of the other young fellows like a shadow.
      She never "Mistered" these friends of hers, but called them "Billy,"
      "Tom," "John," and they called her "Puss" or "Hattie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marsh sat at the head of the table, his wife sat at the foot. Marsh
      was a man of sixty, and was an American; but if he had been born a month
      earlier he would have been a Spaniard. He was plenty good enough Spaniard
      as it was; his face was very dark, his hair very black, and his eyes were
      not only exceedingly black but were very intense, and there was something
      about them that indicated that they could burn with passion upon occasion.
      He was stoop-shouldered and lean-faced, and the general aspect of him was
      disagreeable; he was evidently not a very companionable person. If looks
      went for anything, he was the very opposite of his wife, who was all
      motherliness and charity, good will and good nature. All the young men and
      the women called her Aunt Rachael, which was another sign. Tracy's
      wandering and interested eye presently fell upon one boarder who had been
      overlooked in the distribution of the stew. He was very pale and looked as
      if he had but lately come out of a sick bed, and also as if he ought to
      get back into it again as soon as possible. His face was very melancholy.
      The waves of laughter and conversation broke upon it without affecting it
      any more than if it had been a rock in the sea and the words and the
      laughter veritable waters. He held his head down and looked ashamed. Some
      of the women cast glances of pity toward him from time to time in a
      furtive and half afraid way, and some of the youngest of the men plainly
      had compassion on the young fellow&mdash;a compassion exhibited in their
      faces but not in any more active or compromising way. But the great
      majority of the people present showed entire indifference to the youth and
      his sorrows. Marsh sat with his head down, but one could catch the
      malicious gleam of his eyes through his shaggy brows. He was watching that
      young fellow with evident relish. He had not neglected him through
      carelessness, and apparently the table understood that fact. The spectacle
      was making Mrs. Marsh very uncomfortable. She had the look of one who
      hopes against hope that the impossible may happen. But as the impossible
      did not happen, she finally ventured to speak up and remind her husband
      that Nat Brady hadn't been helped to the Irish stew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marsh lifted his head and gasped out with mock courtliness, "Oh, he
      hasn't, hasn't he? What a pity that is. I don't know how I came to
      overlook him. Ah, he must pardon me. You must indeed Mr&mdash;er&mdash;Baxter&mdash;Barker,
      you must pardon me. I&mdash;er&mdash;my attention was directed to some
      other matter, I don't know what. The thing that grieves me mainly is, that
      it happens every meal now. But you must try to overlook these little
      things, Mr. Bunker, these little neglects on my part. They're always
      likely to happen with me in any case, and they are especially likely to
      happen where a person has&mdash;er&mdash;well, where a person is, say,
      about three weeks in arrears for his board. You get my meaning?&mdash;you
      get my idea? Here is your Irish stew, and&mdash;er&mdash;it gives me the
      greatest pleasure to send it to you, and I hope that you will enjoy the
      charity as much as I enjoy conferring it."
    </p>
    <p>
      A blush rose in Brady's white cheeks and flowed slowly backward to his
      ears and upward toward his forehead, but he said nothing and began to eat
      his food under the embarrassment of a general silence and the sense that
      all eyes were fastened upon him. Barrow whispered to Tracy:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The old man's been waiting for that. He wouldn't have missed that chance
      for anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a brutal business," said Tracy. Then he said to himself, purposing
      to set the thought down in his diary later:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, here in this very house is a republic where all are free and equal,
      if men are free and equal anywhere in the earth, therefore I have arrived
      at the place I started to find, and I am a man among men, and on the
      strictest equality possible to men, no doubt. Yet here on the threshold I
      find an inequality. There are people at this table who are looked up to
      for some reason or another, and here is a poor devil of a boy who is
      looked down upon, treated with indifference, and shamed by humiliations,
      when he has committed no crime but that common one of being poor. Equality
      ought to make men noble-minded. In fact I had supposed it did do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, Barrow proposed a walk, and they started. Barrow had a
      purpose. He wanted Tracy to get rid of that cowboy hat. He didn't see his
      way to finding mechanical or manual employment for a person rigged in that
      fashion. Barrow presently said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I understand it, you're not a cowboy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, now if you will not think me too curious, how did you come to mount
      that hat? Where'd you get it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy didn't know quite how to reply to this, but presently said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, without going into particulars, I exchanged clothes with a stranger
      under stress of weather, and I would like to find him and re-exchange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, why don't you find him? Where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I supposed the best way to find him would be to continue to
      wear his clothes, which are conspicuous enough to attract his attention if
      I should meet him on the street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very well," said Barrow, "the rest of the outfit, is well enough, and
      while it's not too conspicuous, it isn't quite like the clothes that
      anybody else wears. Suppress the hat. When you meet your man he'll
      recognize the rest of his suit. That's a mighty embarrassing hat, you
      know, in a centre of civilization like this. I don't believe an angel
      could get employment in Washington in a halo like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="p124" id="p124"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img alt="p124.jpg (22K)" src="images/p124.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy agreed to replace the hat with something of a modester form, and
      they stepped aboard a crowded car and stood with others on the rear
      platform. Presently, as the car moved swiftly along the rails, two men
      crossing the street caught sight of the backs of Barrow and Tracy, and
      both exclaimed at once, "There he is!" It was Sellers and Hawkins. Both
      were so paralyzed with joy that before they could pull themselves together
      and make an effort to stop the car, it was gone too far, and they decided
      to wait for the next one. They waited a while; then it occurred to
      Washington that there could be no use in chasing one horse-car with
      another, and he wanted to hunt up a hack. But the Colonel said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you come to think of it, there's no occasion for that at all. Now
      that I've got him materialized, I can command his motions. I'll have him
      at the house by the time we get there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they hurried off home in a state of great and joyful excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hat exchange accomplished, the two new friends started to walk back
      leisurely to the boarding house. Barrow's mind was full of curiosity about
      this young fellow. He said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've never been to the Rocky Mountains?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've never been out on the plains?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have you been in this country?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've never been in America before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Barrow communed with himself. "Now what odd shapes the notions of
      romantic people take. Here's a young fellow who's read in England about
      cowboys and adventures on the plains. He comes here and buys a cowboy's
      suit. Thinks he can play himself on folks for a cowboy, all inexperienced
      as he is. Now the minute he's caught in this poor little game, he's
      ashamed of it and ready to retire from it. It is that exchange that he has
      put up as an explanation. It's rather thin, too thin altogether. Well,
      he's young, never been anywhere, knows nothing about the world,
      sentimental, no doubt. Perhaps it was the natural thing for him to do, but
      it was a most singular choice, curious freak, altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both men were busy with their thoughts for a time, then Tracy heaved a
      sigh and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Barrow, the case of that young fellow troubles me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean Nat Brady?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Brady, or Baxter, or whatever it was. The old landlord called him by
      several different names."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, he has been very liberal with names for Brady, since Brady fell
      into arrears for his board. Well, that's one of his sarcasms&mdash;the old
      man thinks he's great on sarcasm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is Brady's difficulty? What is Brady&mdash;who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brady is a tinner. He's a young journeyman tinner who was getting along
      all right till he fell sick and lost his job. He was very popular before
      he lost his job; everybody in the house liked Brady. The old man was
      rather especially fond of him, but you know that when a man loses his job
      and loses his ability to support himself and to pay his way as he goes, it
      makes a great difference in the way people look at him and feel about
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so! Is it so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrow looked at Tracy in a puzzled way. "Why of course it's so. Wouldn't
      you know that, naturally. Don't you know that the wounded deer is always
      attacked and killed by its companions and friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy said to himself, while a chilly and boding discomfort spread itself
      through his system, "In a republic of deer and men where all are free and
      equal, misfortune is a crime, and the prosperous gore the unfortunate to
      death." Then he said aloud, "Here in the boarding house, if one would have
      friends and be popular instead of having the cold shoulder turned upon
      him, he must be prosperous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," Barrow said, "that is so. It's their human nature. They do turn
      against Brady, now that he's unfortunate, and they don't like him as well
      as they did before; but it isn't because of any lack in Brady&mdash;he's
      just as he was before, has the same nature and the same impulses, but they&mdash;well,
      Brady is a thorn in their consciences, you see. They know they ought to
      help him and they're too stingy to do it, and they're ashamed of
      themselves for that, and they ought also to hate themselves on that
      account, but instead of that they hate Brady because he makes them ashamed
      of themselves. I say that's human nature; that occurs everywhere; this
      boarding house is merely the world in little, it's the case all over&mdash;they're
      all alike. In prosperity we are popular; popularity comes easy in that
      case, but when the other thing comes our friends are pretty likely to turn
      against us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy's noble theories and high purposes were beginning to feel pretty
      damp and clammy. He wondered if by any possibility he had made a mistake
      in throwing his own prosperity to the winds and taking up the cross of
      other people's unprosperity. But he wouldn't listen to that sort of thing;
      he cast it out of his mind and resolved to go ahead resolutely along the
      course he had mapped out for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extracts from his diary:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Have now spent several days in this singular hive. I don't know quite
        what to make out of these people. They have merits and virtues, but they
        have some other qualities, and some ways that are hard to get along
        with. I can't enjoy them. The moment I appeared in a hat of the period,
        I noticed a change. The respect which had been paid me before, passed
        suddenly away, and the people became friendly&mdash;more than that&mdash;they
        became familiar, and I'm not used to familiarity, and can't take to it
        right off; I find that out. These people's familiarity amounts to
        impudence, sometimes. I suppose it's all right; no doubt I can get used
        to it, but it's not a satisfactory process at all. I have accomplished
        my dearest wish, I am a man among men, on an equal footing with Tom,
        Dick and Harry, and yet it isn't just exactly what I thought it was
        going to be. I&mdash;I miss home. Am obliged to say I am homesick.
        Another thing&mdash;and this is a confession&mdash;a reluctant one, but
        I will make it: The thing I miss most and most severely, is the respect,
        the deference, with which I was treated all my life in England, and
        which seems to be somehow necessary to me. I get along very well without
        the luxury and the wealth and the sort of society I've been accustomed
        to, but I do miss the respect and can't seem to get reconciled to the
        absence of it. There is respect, there is deference here, but it doesn't
        fall to my share. It is lavished on two men. One of them is a portly man
        of middle age who is a retired plumber. Everybody is pleased to have
        that man's notice. He's full of pomp and circumstance and self
        complacency and bad grammar, and at table he is Sir Oracle and when he
        opens his mouth not any dog in the kennel barks. The other person is a
        policeman at the capitol-building. He represents the government. The
        deference paid to these two men is not so very far short of that paid to
        an earl in England, though the method of it differs. Not so much
        courtliness, but the deference is all there. <br /><br /> Yes, and there
        is obsequiousness, too. <br /><br /> It does rather look as if in a
        republic where all are free and equal, prosperity and position
        constitute rank.

      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The days drifted by, and they grew ever more dreary. For Barrow's efforts
      to find work for Tracy were unavailing. Always the first question asked
      was, "What Union do you belong to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy was obliged to reply that he didn't belong to any trade-union.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then, it's impossible to employ you. My men wouldn't stay with
      me if I should employ a 'scab,' or 'rat,'" or whatever the phrase was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Tracy had a happy thought. He said, "Why the thing for me to do,
      of course, is to join a trade-union."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," Barrow said, "that is the thing for you to do&mdash;if you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I can? Is it difficult?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Yes," Barrow said, "it's sometimes difficult&mdash;in fact, very
      difficult. But you can try, and of course it will be best to try."
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore Tracy tried; but he did not succeed. He was refused admission
      with a good deal of promptness, and was advised to go back home, where he
      belonged, not come here taking honest men's bread out of their mouths.
      Tracy began to realize that the situation was desperate, and the thought
      made him cold to the marrow. He said to himself, "So there is an
      aristocracy of position here, and an aristocracy of prosperity, and
      apparently there is also an aristocracy of the ins as opposed to the outs,
      and I am with the outs. So the ranks grow daily, here. Plainly there are
      all kinds of castes here and only one that I belong to, the outcasts." But
      he couldn't even smile at his small joke, although he was obliged to
      confess that he had a rather good opinion of it. He was feeling so
      defeated and miserable by this time that he could no longer look with
      philosophical complacency on the horseplay of the young fellows in the
      upper rooms at night. At first it had been pleasant to see them unbend and
      have a good time after having so well earned it by the labors of the day,
      but now it all rasped upon his feelings and his dignity. He lost patience
      with the spectacle. When they were feeling good, they shouted, they
      scuffled, they sang songs, they romped about the place like cattle, and
      they generally wound up with a pillow fight, in which they banged each
      other over the head, and threw the pillows in all directions, and every
      now and then he got a buffet himself; and they were always inviting him to
      join in. They called him "Johnny Bull," and invited him with excessive
      familiarity to take a hand. At first he had endured all this with good
      nature, but latterly he had shown by his manner that it was distinctly
      distasteful to him, and very soon he saw a change in the manner of these
      young people toward him. They were souring on him as they would have
      expressed it in their language. He had never been what might be called
      popular. That was hardly the phrase for it; he had merely been liked, but
      now dislike for him was growing. His case was not helped by the fact that
      he was out of luck, couldn't get work, didn't belong to a union, and
      couldn't gain admission to one. He got a good many slights of that small
      ill-defined sort that you can't quite put your finger on, and it was
      manifest that there was only one thing which protected him from open
      insult, and that was his muscle. These young people had seen him
      exercising, mornings, after his cold sponge bath, and they had perceived
      by his performance and the build of his body, that he was athletic, and
      also versed in boxing. He felt pretty naked now, recognizing that he was
      shorn of all respect except respect for his fists. One night when he
      entered his room he found about a dozen of the young fellows there
      carrying on a very lively conversation punctuated with horse-laughter. The
      talking ceased instantly, and the frank affront of a dead silence
      followed. He said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening gentlemen," and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no response. He flushed to the temples but forced himself to
      maintain silence. He sat there in this uncomfortable stillness some time,
      then got up and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment he had disappeared he heard a prodigious shout of laughter
      break forth. He saw that their plain purpose had been to insult him. He
      ascended to the flat roof, hoping to be able to cool down his spirit there
      and get back his tranquility. He found the young tinner up there, alone
      and brooding, and entered into conversation with him. They were pretty
      fairly matched, now, in unpopularity and general ill-luck and misery, and
      they had no trouble in meeting upon this common ground with advantage and
      something of comfort to both. But Tracy's movements had been watched, and
      in a few minutes the tormentors came straggling one after another to the
      roof, where they began to stroll up and down in an apparently purposeless
      way. But presently they fell to dropping remarks that were evidently aimed
      at Tracy, and some of them at the tinner. The ringleader of this little
      mob was a short-haired bully and amateur prize-fighter named Allen, who
      was accustomed to lording it over the upper floor, and had more than once
      shown a disposition to make trouble with Tracy. Now there was an
      occasional cat-call, and hootings, and whistlings, and finally the
      diversion of an exchange of connected remarks was introduced:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many does it take to make a pair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, two generally makes a pair, but sometimes there ain't stuff enough
      in them to make a whole pair." General laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were you saying about the English a while ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing, the English are all right, only&mdash;I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it you said about them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I only said they swallow well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swallow better than other people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, the English swallow a good deal better than other people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it they swallow best?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, insults." Another general laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty hard to make 'em fight, ain't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, taint hard to make 'em fight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't it, really?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, taint hard. It's impossible." Another laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This one's kind of spiritless, that's certain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't be the other way&mdash;in his case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you know the secret of his birth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! has he got a secret of his birth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet he has."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His father was a wax-figger."
    </p>
    <p>
      Allen came strolling by where the pair were sitting; stopped, and said to
      the tinner;
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you off for friends, these days?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well enough off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got a good many?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as many as I need."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A friend is valuable, sometimes&mdash;as a protector, you know. What do
      you reckon would happen if I was to snatch your cap off and slap you in
      the face with it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please don't trouble me, Mr. Allen, I ain't doing anything to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You answer me! What do you reckon would happen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't know."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy spoke up with a good deal of deliberation and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't trouble the young fellow, I can tell you what would happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you can, can you? Boys, Johnny Bull can tell us what would happen if
      I was to snatch this chump's cap off and slap him in the face with it. Now
      you'll see."
    </p>
    <p>
      He snatched the cap and struck the youth in the face, and before he could
      inquire what was going to happen, it had already happened, and he was
      warming the tin with the broad of his back. Instantly there was a rush,
      and shouts of:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A ring, a ring, make a ring! Fair play all round! Johnny's grit; give him
      a chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      The ring was quickly chalked on the tin, and Tracy found himself as eager
      to begin as he could have been if his antagonist had been a prince instead
      of a mechanic. At bottom he was a little surprised at this, because
      although his theories had been all in that direction for some time, he was
      not prepared to find himself actually eager to measure strength with quite
      so common a man as this ruffian. In a moment all the windows in the
      neighborhood were filled with people, and the roofs also. The men squared
      off, and the fight began. But Allen stood no chance whatever, against the
      young Englishman. Neither in muscle nor in science was he his equal. He
      measured his length on the tin time and again; in fact, as fast as he
      could get up he went down again, and the applause was kept up in liberal
      fashion from all the neighborhood around. Finally, Allen had to be helped
      up. Then Tracy declined to punish him further and the fight was at an end.
      Allen was carried off by some of his friends in a very much humbled
      condition, his face black and blue and bleeding, and Tracy was at once
      surrounded by the young fellows, who congratulated him, and told him that
      he had done the whole house a service, and that from this out Mr. Allen
      would be a little more particular about how he handled slights and insults
      and maltreatment around amongst the boarders.

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy was a hero now, and exceedingly popular. Perhaps nobody had ever
      been quite so popular on that upper floor before. But if being
      discountenanced by these young fellows had been hard to bear, their lavish
      commendations and approval and hero-worship were harder still to endure.
      He felt degraded, but he did not allow himself to analyze the reasons why,
      too closely. He was content to satisfy himself with the suggestion that he
      looked upon himself as degraded by the public spectacle which he had made
      of himself, fighting on a tin roof, for the delectation of everybody a
      block or two around. But he wasn't entirely satisfied with that
      explanation of it. Once he went a little too far and wrote in his diary
      that his case was worse than that of the prodigal son. He said the
      prodigal son merely fed swine, he didn't have to chum with them. But he
      struck that out, and said "All men are equal. I will not disown my
      principles. These men are as good as I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy was become popular on the lower floors also. Everybody was grateful
      for Allen's reduction to the ranks, and for his transformation from a doer
      of outrages to a mere threatener of them. The young girls, of whom there
      were half a dozen, showed many attentions to Tracy, particularly that
      boarding house pet Hattie, the landlady's daughter. She said to him, very
      sweetly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you're ever so nice."
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he said, "I'm glad you think so, Miss Hattie," she said, still
      more sweetly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't call me Miss Hattie&mdash;call me Puss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, here was promotion! He had struck the summit. There were no higher
      heights to climb in that boarding house. His popularity was complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the presence of people, Tracy showed a tranquil outside, but his heart
      was being eaten out of him by distress and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a little while he should be out of money, and then what should he do?
      He wished, now, that he had borrowed a little more liberally from that
      stranger's store. He found it impossible to sleep. A single torturing,
      terrifying thought went racking round and round in his head, wearing a
      groove in his brain: What should he do&mdash;What was to become of him?
      And along with it began to intrude a something presently which was very
      like a wish that he had not joined the great and noble ranks of martyrdom,
      but had stayed at home and been content to be merely an earl and nothing
      better, with nothing more to do in this world of a useful sort than an
      earl finds to do. But he smothered that part of his thought as well as he
      could; he made every effort to drive it away, and with fair success, but
      he couldn't keep it from intruding a little now and then, and when it
      intruded it came suddenly and nipped him like a bite, a sting, a burn. He
      recognized that thought by the peculiar sharpness of its pang. The others
      were painful enough, but that one cut to the quick when it came. Night
      after night he lay tossing to the music of the hideous snoring of the
      honest bread-winners until two and three o'clock in the morning, then got
      up and took refuge on the roof, where he sometimes got a nap and sometimes
      failed entirely. His appetite was leaving him and the zest of life was
      going along with it. Finally, one day, being near the imminent verge of
      total discouragement, he said to himself&mdash;and took occasion to blush
      privately when he said it, "If my father knew what my American name is,&mdash;he&mdash;well,
      my duty to my father rather requires that I furnish him my name. I have no
      right to make his days and nights unhappy, I can do enough unhappiness for
      the family all by myself. Really he ought to know what my American name
      is." He thought over it a while and framed a cablegram in his mind to this
      effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My American name is Howard Tracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      That wouldn't be suggesting anything. His father could understand that as
      he chose, and doubtless he would understand it as it was meant, as a
      dutiful and affectionate desire on the part of a son to make his old
      father happy for a moment. Continuing his train of thought, Tracy said to
      himself, "Ah, but if he should cable me to come home! I&mdash;I&mdash;couldn't
      do that&mdash;I mustn't do that. I've started out on a mission, and I
      mustn't turn my back on it in cowardice. No, no, I couldn't go home, at&mdash;at&mdash;least
      I shouldn't want to go home." After a reflective pause: "Well, maybe&mdash;perhaps&mdash;it
      would be my duty to go in the circumstances; he's very old and he does
      need me by him to stay his footsteps down the long hill that inclines
      westward toward the sunset of his life. Well, I'll think about that. Yes,
      of course it wouldn't be right to stay here. If I&mdash;well, perhaps I
      could just drop him a line and put it off a little while and satisfy him
      in that way. It would be&mdash;well, it would mar everything to have him
      require me to come instantly." Another reflective pause&mdash;then: "And
      yet if he should do that I don't know but&mdash;oh, dear me&mdash;home!
      how good it sounds! and a body is excusable for wanting to see his home
      again, now and then, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to one of the telegraph offices in the avenue and got the first
      end of what Barrow called the "usual Washington courtesy," where "they
      treat you as a tramp until they find out you're a congressman, and then
      they slobber all over you." There was a boy of seventeen on duty there,
      tying his shoe. He had his foot on a chair and his back turned toward the
      wicket. He glanced over his shoulder, took Tracy's measure, turned back,
      and went on tying his shoe. Tracy finished writing his telegram and
      waited, still waited, and still waited, for that performance to finish,
      but there didn't seem to be any finish to it; so finally Tracy said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you take my telegram?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth looked over his shoulder and said, by his manner, not his words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think you could wait a minute, if you tried?"
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he got the shoe tied at last, and came and took the telegram,
      glanced over it, then looked up surprised, at Tracy. There was something
      in his look that bordered upon respect, almost reverence, it seemed to
      Tracy, although he had been so long without anything of this kind he was
      not sure that he knew the signs of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy read the address aloud, with pleased expression in face and voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Earl of Rossmore! Cracky! Do you know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so! Does he know you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I swear! Will he answer you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will he though? Where'll you have it sent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nowhere. I'll call here and get it. When shall I call?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't know&mdash;I'll send it to you. Where shall I send it? Give
      me your address; I'll send it to you soon's it comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tracy didn't propose to do this. He had acquired the boy's admiration
      and deferential respect, and he wasn't willing to throw these precious
      things away, a result sure to follow if he should give the address of that
      boarding house. So he said again that he would call and get the telegram,
      and went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He idled along, reflecting. He said to himself, "There is something
      pleasant about being respected. I have acquired the respect of Mr. Allen
      and some of those others, and almost the deference of some of them on pure
      merit, for having thrashed Allen. While their respect and their deference&mdash;if
      it is deference&mdash;is pleasant, a deference based upon a sham, a
      shadow, does really seem pleasanter still. It's no real merit to be in
      correspondence with an earl, and yet after all, that boy makes me feel as
      if there was."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cablegram was actually gone home! the thought of it gave him an
      immense uplift. He walked with a lighter tread. His heart was full of
      happiness. He threw aside all hesitances and confessed to himself that he
      was glad through and through that he was going to give up this experiment
      and go back to his home again. His eagerness to get his father's answer
      began to grow, now, and it grew with marvelous celerity, after it began.
      He waited an hour, walking about, putting in his time as well as he could,
      but interested in nothing that came under his eye, and at last he
      presented himself at the office again and asked if any answer had come
      yet. The boy said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no answer yet," then glanced at the clock and added, "I don't think
      it's likely you'll get one to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see it's getting pretty late. You can't always tell where
      'bouts a man is when he's on the other side, and you can't always find him
      just the minute you want him, and you see it's getting about six o'clock
      now, and over there it's pretty late at night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why yes," said Tracy, "I hadn't thought of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, pretty late, now, half past ten or eleven. Oh yes, you probably
      won't get any answer to-night."
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      So Tracy went home to supper. The odors in that supper room seemed more
      strenuous and more horrible than ever before, and he was happy in the
      thought that he was so soon to be free from them again. When the supper
      was over he hardly knew whether he had eaten any of it or not, and he
      certainly hadn't heard any of the conversation. His heart had been dancing
      all the time, his thoughts had been faraway from these things, and in the
      visions of his mind the sumptuous appointments of his father's castle had
      risen before him without rebuke. Even the plushed flunkey, that walking
      symbol of a sham inequality, had not been unpleasant to his dreaming view.
      After the meal Barrow said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come with me. I'll give you a jolly evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good. Where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To my club."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What club is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mechanics' Debating Club."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="p144" id="p144"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy shuddered, slightly. He didn't say anything about having visited
      that place himself. Somehow he didn't quite relish the memory of that
      time. The sentiments which had made his former visit there so enjoyable,
      and filled him with such enthusiasm, had undergone a gradual change, and
      they had rotted away to such a degree that he couldn't contemplate another
      visit there with anything strongly resembling delight. In fact he was a
      little ashamed to go; he didn't want to go there and find out by the rude
      impact of the thought of those people upon his reorganized condition of
      mind, how sharp the change had been. He would have preferred to stay away.
      He expected that now he should hear nothing except sentiments which would
      be a reproach to him in his changed mental attitude, and he rather wished
      he might be excused. And yet he didn't quite want to say that, he didn't
      want to show how he did feel, or show any disinclination to go, and so he
      forced himself to go along with Barrow, privately purposing to take an
      early opportunity to get away.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the essayist of the evening had read his paper, the chairman
      announced that the debate would now be upon the subject of the previous
      meeting, "The American Press." It saddened the backsliding disciple to
      hear this announcement. It brought up too many reminiscences. He wished he
      had happened upon some other subject. But the debate began, and he sat
      still and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the discussion one of the speakers&mdash;a blacksmith
      named Tompkins arraigned all monarchs and all lords in the earth for their
      cold selfishness in retaining their unearned dignities. He said that no
      monarch and no son of a monarch, no lord and no son of a lord ought to be
      able to look his fellow man in the face without shame. Shame for
      consenting to keep his unearned titles, property, and privileges&mdash;at
      the expense of other people; shame for consenting to remain, on any terms,
      in dishonourable possession of these things, which represented bygone
      robberies and wrongs inflicted upon the general people of the nation. He
      said, "if there were a lord or the son of a lord here, I would like to
      reason with him, and try to show him how unfair and how selfish his
      position is. I would try to persuade him to relinquish it, take his place
      among men on equal terms, earn the bread he eats, and hold of slight value
      all deference paid him because of artificial position, all reverence not
      the just due of his own personal merits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy seemed to be listening to utterances of his own made in talks with
      his radical friends in England. It was as if some eavesdropping phonograph
      had treasured up his words and brought them across the Atlantic to accuse
      him with them in the hour of his defection and retreat. Every word spoken
      by this stranger seemed to leave a blister on Tracy's conscience, and by
      the time the speech was finished he felt that he was all conscience and
      one blister. This man's deep compassion for the enslaved and oppressed
      millions in Europe who had to bear with the contempt of that small class
      above them, throned upon shining heights whose paths were shut against
      them, was the very thing he had often uttered himself. The pity in this
      man's voice and words was the very twin of the pity that used to reside in
      his own heart and come from his own lips when he thought of these
      oppressed peoples.
    </p>
    <p>
      The homeward tramp was accomplished in brooding silence. It was a silence
      most grateful to Tracy's feelings. He wouldn't have broken it for
      anything; for he was ashamed of himself all the way through to his spine.
      He kept saying to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      "How unanswerable it all is&mdash;how absolutely unanswerable! It is
      basely, degradingly selfish to keep those unearned honors, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
      hang it, nobody but a cur&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an idiotic damned speech that Tompkins made!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This outburst was from Barrow. It flooded Tracy's demoralized soul with
      waters of refreshment. These were the darlingest words the poor
      vacillating young apostate had ever heard&mdash;for they whitewashed his
      shame for him, and that is a good service to have when you can't get the
      best of all verdicts, self-acquittal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come up to my room and smoke a pipe, Tracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy had been expecting this invitation, and had had his declination all
      ready: but he was glad enough to accept, now. Was it possible that a
      reasonable argument could be made against that man's desolating speech? He
      was burning to hear Barrow try it. He knew how to start him, and keep him
      going: it was to seem to combat his positions&mdash;a process effective
      with most people.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it you object to in Tompkins's speech, Barrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the leaving out of the factor of human nature; requiring another man
      to do what you wouldn't do yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why here's what I mean; it's very simple. Tompkins is a blacksmith; has a
      family; works for wages; and hard, too&mdash;fooling around won't furnish
      the bread. Suppose it should turn out that by the death of somebody in
      England he is suddenly an earl&mdash;income, half a million dollars a
      year. What would he do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I&mdash;I suppose he would have to decline to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man, he would grab it in a second!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really think he would?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think?&mdash;I don't think anything about it, I know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Because he's not a fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you think that if he were a fool, he&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't. Fool or no fool, he would grab it. Anybody would. Anybody
      that's alive. And I've seen dead people that would get up and go for it. I

      This was balm, this was healing, this was rest and peace and comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I thought you were opposed to nobilities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Transmissible ones, yes. But that's nothing. I'm opposed to millionaires,
      but it would be dangerous to offer me the position."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would leave the funeral of my dearest enemy to go and assume its
      burdens and responsibilities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy thought a while, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that I quite get the bearings of your position. You say you
      are opposed to hereditary nobilities, and yet if you had the chance you
      would&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take one? In a minute I would. And there isn't a mechanic in that entire
      club that wouldn't. There isn't a lawyer, doctor, editor, author, tinker,
      loafer, railroad president, saint&mdash;land, there isn't a human being in
      the United States that wouldn't jump at the chance!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except me," said Tracy softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except you!" Barrow could hardly get the words out, his scorn so choked
      him. And he couldn't get any further than that form of words; it seemed to
      dam his flow, utterly. He got up and came and glared upon Tracy in a kind
      of outraged and unappeasable way, and said again, "Except you!" He walked
      around him&mdash;inspecting him from one point of view and then another,
      and relieving his soul now and then by exploding that formula at him;
      "Except you!" Finally he slumped down into his chair with the air of one
      who gives it up, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's straining his viscera and he's breaking his heart trying to get some
      low-down job that a good dog wouldn't have, and yet wants to let on that
      if he had a chance to scoop an earldom he wouldn't do it. Tracy, don't put
      this kind of a strain on me. Lately I'm not as strong as I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I wasn't meaning to put&mdash;a strain on you, Barrow, I was only
      meaning to intimate that if an earldom ever does fall in my way&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There&mdash;I wouldn't give myself any worry about that, if I was you.
      And besides, I can settle what you would do. Are you any different from
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you any better than me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O,&mdash;er&mdash;why, certainly not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you as good? Come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I&mdash;the fact is you take me so suddenly&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suddenly? What is there sudden about it? It isn't a difficult question is
      it? Or doubtful? Just measure us on the only fair lines&mdash;the lines of
      merit&mdash;and of course you'll admit that a journeyman chairmaker that
      earns his twenty dollars a week, and has had the good and genuine culture
      of contact with men, and care, and hardship, and failure, and success, and
      downs and ups and ups and downs, is just a trifle the superior of a young
      fellow like you, who doesn't know how to do anything that's valuable,
      can't earn his living in any secure and steady way, hasn't had any
      experience of life and its seriousness, hasn't any culture but the
      artificial culture of books, which adorns but doesn't really educate&mdash;come!
      if I wouldn't scorn an earldom, what the devil right have you to do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy dissembled his joy, though he wanted to thank the chair-maker for
      that last remark. Presently a thought struck him, and he spoke up briskly
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But look here, I really can't quite get the hang of your notions&mdash;your
      principles, if they are principles. You are inconsistent. You are opposed
      to aristocracies, yet you'd take an earldom if you could. Am I to
      understand that you don't blame an earl for being and remaining an earl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly don't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you wouldn't blame Tompkins, or yourself, or me, or anybody, for
      accepting an earldom if it was offered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I wouldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, whom would you blame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole nation&mdash;any bulk and mass of population anywhere, in any
      country, that will put up with the infamy, the outrage, the insult of a
      hereditary aristocracy which they can't enter&mdash;and on absolutely free
      and equal terms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, aren't you beclouding yourself with distinctions that are not
      differences?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I am not. I am entirely clear-headed about this thing. If I could
      extirpate an aristocratic system by declining its honors, then I should be
      a rascal to accept them. And if enough of the mass would join me to make
      the extirpation possible, then I should be a rascal to do otherwise than
      help in the attempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe I understand&mdash;yes, I think I get the idea. You have no
      blame for the lucky few who naturally decline to vacate the pleasant nest
      they were born into, you only despise the all-powerful and stupid mass of
      the nation for allowing the nest to exist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it, that's it! You can get a simple thing through your head if you
      work at it long enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mention it. And I'll give you some sound advice: when you go back;
      if you find your nation up and ready to abolish that hoary affront, lend a
      hand; but if that isn't the state of things and you get a chance at an
      earldom, don't you be a fool&mdash;you take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy responded with earnestness and enthusiasm:
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I live, I'll do it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrow laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never saw such a fellow. I begin to think you've got a good deal of
      imagination. With you, the idlest fancy freezes into a reality at a
      breath. Why, you looked, then, as if it wouldn't astonish you if you did
      tumble into an earldom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy blushed. Barrow added: "Earldom! Oh, yes, take it, if it offers; but
      meantime we'll go on looking around, in a modest way, and if you get a
      chance to superintend a sausage-stuffer at six or eight dollars a week,
      you just trade off the earldom for a last year's almanac and stick to the
      sausage-stuffing."

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy went to bed happy once more, at rest in his mind once more. He had
      started out on a high emprise&mdash;that was to his credit, he argued; he
      had fought the best fight he could, considering the odds against him&mdash;that
      was to his credit; he had been defeated&mdash;certainly there was nothing
      discreditable in that. Being defeated, he had a right to retire with the
      honors of war and go back without prejudice to the position in the world's
      society to which he had been born. Why not? even the rabid republican
      chair-maker would do that. Yes, his conscience was comfortable once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He woke refreshed, happy, and eager for his cablegram. He had been born an
      aristocrat, he had been a democrat for a time, he was now an aristocrat
      again. He marveled to find that this final change was not merely
      intellectual, it had invaded his feeling; and he also marveled to note
      that this feeling seemed a good deal less artificial than any he had
      entertained in his system for a long time. He could also have noted, if he
      had thought of it, that his bearing had stiffened, over night, and that
      his chin had lifted itself a shade. Arrived in the basement, he was about
      to enter the breakfast room when he saw old Marsh in the dim light of a
      corner of the hall, beckoning him with his finger to approach. The blood
      welled slowly up in Tracy's cheek, and he said with a grade of injured
      dignity almost ducal:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the purpose of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to speak to you&mdash;in private."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This spot is private enough for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Marsh was surprised; and not particularly pleased. He approached and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, in public, then, if you prefer. Though it hasn't been my way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boarders gathered to the spot, interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak out," said Tracy. "What is it you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, haven't you&mdash;er&mdash;forgot something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? I'm not aware of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you're not? Now you stop and think, a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I refuse to stop and think. It doesn't interest me. If it interests you,
      speak out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then," said Marsh, raising his voice to a slightly angry pitch,
      "You forgot to pay your board yesterday&mdash;if you're bound to have it
      public."
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, this heir to an annual million or so had been dreaming and
      soaring, and had forgotten that pitiful three or four dollars. For penalty
      he must have it coarsely flung in his face in the presence of these people&mdash;people
      in whose countenances was already beginning to dawn an uncharitable
      enjoyment of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all! Take your money and give your terrors a rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy's hand went down into his pocket with angry decision. But&mdash;it
      didn't come out. The color began to ebb out of his face. The countenances
      about him showed a growing interest; and some of them a heightened
      satisfaction. There was an uncomfortable pause&mdash;then he forced out,
      with difficulty, the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've&mdash;been robbed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Marsh's eyes flamed up with Spanish fire, and he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Robbed, is it? That's your tune? It's too old&mdash;been played in this
      house too often; everybody plays it that can't get work when he wants it,
      and won't work when he can get it. Trot out Mr. Allen, somebody, and let
      him take a toot at it. It's his turn next, he forgot, too, last night. I'm
      laying for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the negro women came scrambling down stairs as pale as a sorrel
      horse with consternation and excitement:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Misto Marsh, Misto Allen's skipped out!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes-sah, and cleaned out his room clean; tuck bofe towels en de soap!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie, you hussy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's jes' so, jes' as I tells you&mdash;en Misto Summer's socks is gone,
      en Misto Naylor's yuther shirt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Marsh was at boiling point by this time. He turned upon Tracy:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer up now&mdash;when are you going to settle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-day&mdash;since you seem to be in a hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-day is it? Sunday&mdash;and you out of work? I like that. Come&mdash;where
      are you going to get the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy's spirit was rising again. He proposed to impress these people:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am expecting a cablegram from home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Marsh was caught out, with the surprise of it. The idea was so
      immense, so extravagant, that he couldn't get his breath at first. When he
      did get it, it came rancid with sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cablegram&mdash;think of it, ladies and gents, he's expecting a
      cablegram! He's expecting a cablegram&mdash;this duffer, this scrub, this
      bilk! From his father&mdash;eh? Yes&mdash;without a doubt. A dollar or two
      a word&mdash;oh, that's nothing&mdash;they don't mind a little thing like
      that&mdash;this kind's fathers don't. Now his father is&mdash;er&mdash;well,
      I reckon his father&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father is an English earl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd fell back aghast-aghast at the sublimity of the young loafer's
      "cheek." Then they burst into a laugh that made the windows rattle. Tracy
      was too angry to realize that he had done a foolish thing. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand aside, please. I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a minute, your lordship," said Marsh, bowing low, "where is your
      lordship going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the cablegram. Let me pass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, your lordship, you'll stay right where you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that I didn't begin to keep boarding-house yesterday. It means
      that I am not the kind that can be taken in by every hack-driver's son
      that comes loafing over here because he can't bum a living at home. It
      means that you can't skip out on any such&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy made a step toward the old man, but Mrs. Marsh sprang between, and
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, Mr. Tracy, please." She turned to her husband and said, "Do bridle
      your tongue. What has he done to be treated so? Can't you see he has lost
      his mind, with trouble and distress? He's not responsible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank your kind heart, madam, but I've not lost my mind; and if I can
      have the mere privilege of stepping to the telegraph office&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can't," cried Marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;or sending&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sending! That beats everything. If there's anybody that's fool enough to
      go on such a chuckle-headed errand&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here comes Mr. Barrow&mdash;he will go for me. Barrow&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      A brisk fire of exclamations broke out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say, Barrow, he's expecting a cablegram!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cablegram from his father, you know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;cablegram from the wax-figger!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And say, Barrow, this fellow's an earl&mdash;take off your hat, pull down
      your vest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he's come off and forgot his crown, that he wears Sundays. He's
      cabled over to his pappy to send it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You step out and get that cablegram, Barrow; his majesty's a little lame
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh stop," cried Barrow; "give the man a chance." He turned, and said with
      some severity, "Tracy, what's the matter with you? What kind of
      foolishness is this you've been talking. You ought to have more sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've not been talking foolishness; and if you'll go to the telegraph
      office&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh; don't talk so. I'm your friend in trouble and out of it, before your
      face and behind your back, for anything in reason; but you've lost your
      head, you see, and this moonshine about a cablegram&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go there and ask for it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Brady. Here, I'll give you a
      Written order for it. Fly, now, and fetch it. We'll soon see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Brady flew. Immediately the sort of quiet began to steal over the crowd
      which means dawning doubt, misgiving; and might be translated into the
      words, "Maybe he is expecting a cablegram&mdash;maybe he has got a father
      somewhere&mdash;maybe we've been just a little too fresh, just a shade too
      'previous'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Loud talk ceased; then the mutterings and low murmurings and whisperings
      died out. The crowd began to crumble apart. By ones and twos the fragments
      drifted to the breakfast table. Barrow tried to bring Tracy in; but he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet, Barrow&mdash;presently."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Marsh and Hattie tried, offering gentle and kindly persuasions; but
      he said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather wait&mdash;till he comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even old Marsh began to have suspicions that maybe he had been a trifle
      too "brash," as he called it in the privacy of his soul, and he pulled
      himself together and started toward Tracy with invitation in his eyes; but
      Tracy warned him off with a gesture which was quite positive and eloquent.
      Then followed the stillest quarter of an hour which had ever been known in
      that house at that time of day. It was so still, and so solemn withal,
      that when somebody's cup slipped from his fingers and landed in his plate
      the shock made people start, and the sharp sound seemed as indecorous
      there and as out of place as if a coffin and mourners were imminent and
      being waited for. And at last when Brady's feet came clattering down the
      stairs the sacrilege seemed unbearable. Everybody rose softly and turned
      toward the door, where stood Tracy; then with a common impulse, moved a
      step or two in that direction, and stopped. While they gazed, young Brady
      arrived, panting, and put into Tracy's hand,&mdash;sure enough&mdash;an
      envelope. Tracy fastened a bland victorious eye upon the gazers, and kept
      it there till one by one they dropped their eyes, vanquished and
      embarrassed. Then he tore open the telegram and glanced at its message.
      The yellow paper fell from his fingers and fluttered to the floor, and his
      face turned white. There was nothing there but one word&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      The humorist of the house, the tall, raw-boned Billy Nash, caulker from
      the navy yard, was standing in the rear of the crowd. In the midst of the
      pathetic silence that was now brooding over the place and moving some few
      hearts there toward compassion, he began to whimper, then he put his
      handkerchief to his eyes and buried his face in the neck of the bashfulest
      young fellow in the company, a navy-yard blacksmith, shrieked "Oh, pappy,
      how could you!" and began to bawl like a teething baby, if one may imagine
      a baby with the energy and the devastating voice of a jackass.
    </p>
    <p>
      So perfect was that imitation of a child's cry, and so vast the scale of
      it and so ridiculous the aspect of the performer, that all gravity was
      swept from the place as if by a hurricane, and almost everybody there
      joined in the crash of laughter provoked by the exhibition. Then the small
      mob began to take its revenge&mdash;revenge for the discomfort and
      apprehension it had brought upon itself by its own too rash freshness of a
      little while before. It guyed its poor victim, baited him, worried him, as
      dogs do with a cornered cat. The victim answered back with defiances and
      challenges which included everybody, and which only gave the sport new
      spirit and variety; but when he changed his tactics and began to single
      out individuals and invite them by name, the fun lost its funniness and
      the interest of the show died out, along with the noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Marsh was about to take an innings, but Barrow said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, now&mdash;leave him alone. You've no account with him but a
      money account. I'll take care of that myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The distressed and worried landlady gave Barrow a fervently grateful look
      for his championship of the abused stranger; and the pet of the house, a
      very prism in her cheap but ravishing Sunday rig, blew him a kiss from the
      tips of her fingers and said, with the darlingest smile and a sweet little
      toss of her head:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're the only man here, and I'm going to set my cap for you, you dear
      old thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For shame, Puss! How you talk! I never saw such a child!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It took a good deal of argument and persuasion&mdash;that is to say,
      petting, under these disguises&mdash;to get Tracy to entertain the idea of
      breakfast. He at first said he would never eat again in that house; and
      added that he had enough firmness of character, he trusted, to enable him
      to starve like a man when the alternative was to eat insult with his
      bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished his breakfast, Barrow took him to his room, furnished
      him a pipe, and said cheerily:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, old fellow, take in your battle-flag out of the wet, you're not in
      the hostile camp any more. You're a little upset by your troubles, and
      that's natural enough, but don't let your mind run on them anymore than
      you can help; drag your thoughts away from your troubles by the ears, by
      the heels, or any other way, so you manage it; it's the healthiest thing a
      body can do; dwelling on troubles is deadly, just deadly&mdash;and that's
      the softest name there is for it. You must keep your mind amused&mdash;you
      must, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, miserable me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't! There's just pure heart-break in that tone. It's just as I say;
      you've got to get right down to it and amuse your mind, as if it was
      salvation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're easy words to say, Barrow, but how am I going to amuse,
      entertain, divert a mind that finds itself suddenly assaulted and
      overwhelmed by disasters of a sort not dreamed of and not provided for? No&mdash;no,
      the bare idea of amusement is repulsive to my feelings: Let us talk of
      death and funerals."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;not yet. That would be giving up the ship. We'll not give up the
      ship yet. I'm going to amuse you; I sent Brady out for the wherewithal
      before you finished breakfast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did? What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, this is a good sign&mdash;curiosity. Oh, there's hope for you yet."

      Brady arrived with a box, and departed, after saying, "They're finishing
      one up, but they'll be along as soon as it's done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Barrow took a frameless oil portrait a foot square from the box, set it up
      in a good light, without comment, and reached for another, taking a
      furtive glance at Tracy, meantime. The stony solemnity in Tracy's face
      remained as it was, and gave out no sign of interest. Barrow placed the
      second portrait beside the first, and stole another glance while reaching
      for a third. The stone image softened, a shade. No. 3 forced the ghost of
      a smile, No. 4 swept indifference wholly away, and No. 5 started a laugh
      which was still in good and hearty condition when No. 14 took its place in
      the row.

      "Oh, you're all right, yet," said Barrow. "You see you're not past
      amusement."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pictures were fearful, as to color, and atrocious as to drawing and
      expression; but the feature which squelched animosity and made them funny
      was a feature which could not achieve its full force in a single picture,
      but required the wonder-working assistance of repetition. One loudly
      dressed mechanic in stately attitude, with his hand on a cannon, ashore,
      and a ship riding at anchor in the offing,&mdash;this is merely odd; but
      when one sees the same cannon and the same ship in fourteen pictures in a
      row, and a different mechanic standing watch in each, the thing gets to be
      funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain&mdash;explain these aberrations," said Tracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, they are not the achievement of a single intellect, a single talent&mdash;it
      takes two to do these miracles. They are collaborations; the one artist
      does the figure, the other the accessories. The figure-artist is a German
      shoemaker with an untaught passion for art, the other is a simple hearted
      old Yankee sailor-man whose possibilities are strictly limited to his
      ship, his cannon and his patch of petrified sea. They work these things up
      from twenty-five-cent tintypes; they get six dollars apiece for them, and
      they can grind out a couple a day when they strike what they call a boost&mdash;that
      is, an inspiration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "People actually pay money for these calumnies?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They actually do&mdash;and quite willingly, too. And these abortionists
      could double their trade and work the women in, if Capt. Saltmarsh could
      whirl a horse in, or a piano, or a guitar, in place of his cannon. The
      fact is, he fatigues the market with that cannon. Even the male market, I
      mean. These fourteen in the procession are not all satisfied. One is an
      old 'independent' fireman, and he wants an engine in place of the cannon;
      another is a mate of a tug, and wants a tug in place of the ship &mdash;and
      so on, and so on. But the captain can't make a tug that is deceptive, and
      a fire engine is many flights beyond his power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a most extraordinary form of robbery, I never have heard of
      anything like it. It's interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and so are the artists. They are perfectly honest men, and sincere.
      And the old sailor-man is full of sound religion, and is as devoted a
      student of the Bible and misquoter of it as you can find anywhere. I don't
      know a better man or kinder hearted old soul than Saltmarsh, although he
      does swear a little, sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He seems to be perfect. I want to know him, Barrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have the chance. I guess I hear them coming, now. We'll draw them
      out on their art, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      The artists arrived and shook hands with great heartiness. The German was
      forty and a little fleshy, with a shiny bald head and a kindly face and
      deferential manner. Capt. Saltmarsh was sixty, tall, erect, powerfully
      built, with coal-black hair and whiskers, and he had a well tanned
      complexion, and a gait and countenance that were full of command,
      confidence and decision. His horny hands and wrists were covered with
      tattoo-marks, and when his lips parted, his teeth showed up white and
      blemishless. His voice was the effortless deep bass of a church organ, and
      would disturb the tranquility of a gas flame fifty yards away.

      "They're wonderful pictures," said Barrow. "We've been examining them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very bleasant dot you like dem," said Handel, the German, greatly
      pleased. "Und you, Herr Tracy, you haf peen bleased mit dem too, alretty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can honestly say I have never seen anything just like them before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Schon!" cried the German, delighted. "You hear, Gaptain? Here is a
      chentleman, yes, vot abbreviate unser aart."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain was charmed, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir, we're thankful for a compliment yet, though they're not as
      scarce now as they used to be before we made a reputation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Getting the reputation is the up-hill time in most things, captain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so. It ain't enough to know how to reef a gasket, you got to make
      the mate know you know it. That's reputation. The good word, said at the
      right time, that's the word that makes us; and evil be to him that evil
      thinks, as Isaiah says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's very relevant, and hits the point exactly," said Tracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you study art, Captain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't studied; it's a natural gift."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is born mit dose cannon in him. He tondt haf to do noding, his chenius
      do all de vork. Of he is asleep, and take a pencil in his hand, out come a
      cannon. Py crashus, of he could do a clavier, of he could do a guitar, of
      he could do a vashtub, it is a fortune, heiliger Yohanniss it is yoost a
      fortune!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is an immense pity that the business is hindered and limited in
      this unfortunate way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain grew a trifle excited, himself, now:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've said it, Mr. Tracy!&mdash;Hindered? well, I should say so. Why,
      look here. This fellow here, No. 11, he's a hackman,&mdash;a flourishing
      hackman, I may say. He wants his hack in this picture. Wants it where the
      cannon is. I got around that difficulty, by telling him the cannon's our
      trademark, so to speak&mdash;proves that the picture's our work, and I was
      afraid if we left it out people wouldn't know for certain if it was a
      Saltmarsh&mdash;Handel&mdash;now you wouldn't yourself&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Captain? You wrong yourself, indeed you do. Anyone who has once
      seen a genuine Saltmarsh-Handel is safe from imposture forever. Strip it,
      flay it, skin it out of every detail but the bare color and expression,
      and that man will still recognize it&mdash;still stop to worship&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how it makes me feel to hear dose oxpressions!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;"still say to himself again as he had, said a hundred times before,
      the art of the Saltmarsh-Handel is an art apart, there is nothing in the
      heavens above or in the earth beneath that resembles it,&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Py chiminy, nur horen Sie einmal! In my life day haf I never heard so
      brecious worts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I talked him out of the hack, Mr. Tracy, and he let up on that, and
      said put in a hearse, then&mdash;because he's chief mate of a hearse but
      don't own it&mdash;stands a watch for wages, you know. But I can't do a
      hearse any more than I can a hack; so here we are&mdash;becalmed, you see.
      And it's the same with women and such. They come and they want a little
      johnry picture&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the accessories that make it a 'genre?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;cannon, or cat, or any little thing like that, that you heave
      in to whoop up the effect. We could do a prodigious trade with the women
      if we could foreground the things they like, but they don't give a damn
      for artillery. Mine's the lack," continued the captain with a sigh,
      "Andy's end of the business is all right I tell you he's an artist from
      way back!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yoost hear dot old man! He always talk 'poud me like dot," purred the
      pleased German.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at his work yourself! Fourteen portraits in a row. And no two of
      them alike."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that you speak of it, it is true; I hadn't noticed it before. It is
      very remarkable. Unique, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say so. That's the very thing about Andy&mdash;he discriminates.
      Discrimination's the thief of time&mdash;forty-ninth Psalm; but that ain't
      any matter, it's the honest thing, and it pays in the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he certainly is great in that feature, one is obliged to admit it;
      but&mdash;now mind, I'm not really criticising&mdash;don't you think he is
      just a trifle overstrong in technique?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain's face was knocked expressionless by this remark. It remained
      quite vacant while he muttered to himself&mdash; "Technique&mdash;technique&mdash;polytechnique&mdash;pyro-technique;
      that's it, likely&mdash;fireworks too much color." Then he spoke up with
      serenity and confidence, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes, he does pile it on pretty loud; but they all like it, you know&mdash;fact
      is, it's the life of the business. Take that No. 9, there, Evans the
      butcher. He drops into the stoodio as sober-colored as anything you ever
      see: now look at him. You can't tell him from scarlet fever. Well, it
      pleases that butcher to death. I'm making a study of a sausage-wreath to
      hang on the cannon, and I don't really reckon I can do it right, but if I
      can, we can break the butcher."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unquestionably your confederate&mdash;I mean your&mdash;your
      fellow-craftsman&mdash;is a great colorist&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, danke schon!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;"in fact a quite extraordinary colorist; a colorist, I make bold to
      say, without imitator here or abroad&mdash;and with a most bold and
      effective touch, a touch like a battering ram; and a manner so peculiar
      and romantic, and extraneous, and ad libitum, and heart-searching, that&mdash;that&mdash;he&mdash;he
      is an impressionist, I presume?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the captain simply, "he is a Presbyterian."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It accounts for it all&mdash;all&mdash;there's something divine about his
      art,&mdash;soulful, unsatisfactory, yearning, dim hearkening on the void
      horizon, vague&mdash;murmuring to the spirit out of ultra-marine distances
      and far-sounding cataclysms of uncreated space&mdash;oh, if he&mdash;if,
      he&mdash;has he ever tried distemper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain answered up with energy:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if he knows himself! But his dog has, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, it vas not my dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you said it was your dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, gaptain, I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a white dog, wasn't it, with his tail docked, and one ear gone,
      and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dot's him, dot's him!&mdash;der fery dog. Wy, py Chorge, dot dog he would
      eat baint yoost de same like&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, never mind that, now&mdash;'vast heaving&mdash;I never saw such a
      man. You start him on that dog and he'll dispute a year. Blamed if I
      haven't seen him keep it up a level two hours and a half."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why captain!" said Barrow. "I guess that must be hearsay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir, no hearsay about it&mdash;he disputed with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see how you stood it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you've got to&mdash;if you run with Andy. But it's the only fault
      he's got."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't you afraid of acquiring it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," said the captain, tranquilly, "no danger of that, I reckon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The artists presently took their leave. Then Barrow put his hands on
      Tracy's shoulders and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look me in the eye, my boy. Steady, steady. There&mdash;it's just as I
      thought&mdash;hoped, anyway; you're all right, thank goodness. Nothing the
      matter with your mind. But don't do that again&mdash;even for fun. It
      isn't wise. They wouldn't have believed you if you'd been an earl's son.
      Why, they couldn't&mdash;don't you know that? What ever possessed you to
      take such a freak? But never mind about that; let's not talk of it. It was
      a mistake; you see that yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;it was a mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, just drop it out of your mind; it's no harm; we all make them. Pull
      your courage together, and don't brood, and don't give up. I'm at your
      back, and we'll pull through, don't you be afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was gone, Barrow walked the floor a good while, uneasy in his
      mind. He said to himself, "I'm troubled about him. He never would have
      made a break like that if he hadn't been a little off his balance. But I
      know what being out of work and no prospect ahead can do for a man. First
      it knocks the pluck out of him and drags his pride in the dirt; worry does
      the rest, and his mind gets shaky. I must talk to these people. No&mdash;if
      there's any humanity in them&mdash;and there is, at bottom&mdash;they'll
      be easier on him if they think his troubles have disturbed his reason. But
      I've got to find him some work; work's the only medicine for his disease.
      Poor devil! away off here, and not a friend."

    <p>
      The moment Tracy was alone his spirits vanished away, and all the misery
      of his situation was manifest to him. To be moneyless and an object of the
      chairmaker's charity&mdash;this was bad enough, but his folly in
      proclaiming himself an earl's son to that scoffing and unbelieving crew,
      and, on top of that, the humiliating result&mdash;the recollection of
      these things was a sharper torture still. He made up his mind that he
      would never play earl's son again before a doubtful audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father's answer was a blow he could not understand. At times he
      thought his father imagined he could get work to do in America without any
      trouble, and was minded to let him try it and cure himself of his
      radicalism by hard, cold, disenchanting experience. That seemed the most
      plausible theory, yet he could not content himself with it. A theory that
      pleased him better was, that this cablegram would be followed by another,
      of a gentler sort, requiring him to come home. Should he write and strike
      his flag, and ask for a ticket home? Oh, no, that he couldn't ever do. At
      least, not yet. That cablegram would come, it certainly would. So he went
      from one telegraph office to another every day for nearly a week, and
      asked if there was a cablegram for Howard Tracy. No, there wasn't any. So
      they answered him at first. Later, they said it before he had a chance to
      ask. Later still they merely shook their heads impatiently as soon as he
      came in sight. After that he was ashamed to go any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was down in the lowest depths of despair, now; for the harder Barrow
      tried to find work for him the more hopeless the possibilities seemed to
      grow. At last he said to Barrow:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here. I want to make a confession. I have got down, now, to where I
      am not only willing to acknowledge to myself that I am a shabby creature
      and full of false pride, but am willing to acknowledge it to you. Well,
      I've been allowing you to wear yourself out hunting for work for me when
      there's been a chance open to me all the time. Forgive my pride&mdash;what
      was left of it. It is all gone, now, and I've come to confess that if
      those ghastly artists want another confederate, I'm their man&mdash;for at
      last I am dead to shame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No? Really, can you paint?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not as badly as they. No, I don't claim that, for I am not a genius; in
      fact, I am a very indifferent amateur, a slouchy dabster, a mere artistic
      sarcasm; but drunk or asleep I can beat those buccaneers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shake! I want to shout! Oh, I tell you, I am immensely delighted and
      relieved. Oh, just to work&mdash;that is life! No matter what the work is&mdash;that's
      of no consequence. Just work itself is bliss when a man's been starving
      for it. I've been there! Come right along; we'll hunt the old boys up.
      Don't you feel good? I tell you I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The freebooters were not at home. But their "works" were, displayed in
      profusion all about the little ratty studio. Cannon to the right of them,
      cannon to the left of them, cannon in front&mdash;it was Balaclava come
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's the uncontented hackman, Tracy. Buckle to&mdash;deepen the
      sea-green to turf, turn the ship into a hearse. Let the boys have a taste
      of your quality."
    </p>
    <p>
      The artists arrived just as the last touch was put on. They stood
      transfixed with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My souls but she's a stunner, that hearse! The hackman will just go all
      to pieces when he sees that won't he Andy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is sphlennid, sphlennid! Herr Tracy, why haf you not said you vas
      a so sublime aartist? Lob' Gott, of you had lif'd in Paris you would be a
      Pree de Rome, dot's votes de matter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrangements were soon made. Tracy was taken into full and equal
      partnership, and he went straight to work, with dash and energy, to
      reconstructing gems of art whose accessories had failed to satisfy. Under
      his hand, on that and succeeding days, artillery disappeared and the
      emblems of peace and commerce took its place&mdash;cats, hacks, sausages,
      tugs, fire engines, pianos, guitars, rocks, gardens, flower-pots,
      landscapes&mdash;whatever was wanted, he flung it in; and the more out of
      place and absurd the required object was, the more joy he got out of
      fabricating it. The pirates were delighted, the customers applauded, the
      sex began to flock in, great was the prosperity of the firm. Tracy was
      obliged to confess to himself that there was something about work,&mdash;even
      such grotesque and humble work as this&mdash;which most pleasantly
      satisfied a something in his nature which had never been satisfied before,
      and also gave him a strange new dignity in his own private view of
      himself.

      .......................
    </p>
    <p>
      The Unqualified Member from Cherokee Strip was in a state of deep
      dejection. For a good while, now, he had been leading a sort of life which
      was calculated to kill; for it had consisted in regularly alternating days
      of brilliant hope and black disappointment. The brilliant hopes were
      created by the magician Sellers, and they always promised that now he had
      got the trick, sure, and would effectively influence that materialized
      cowboy to call at the Towers before night. The black disappointments
      consisted in the persistent and monotonous failure of these prophecies.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the date which this history has now reached, Sellers was appalled to
      find that the usual remedy was inoperative, and that Hawkins's low spirits
      refused absolutely to lift. Something must be done, he reflected; it was
      heart-breaking, this woe, this smileless misery, this dull despair that
      looked out from his poor friend's face. Yes, he must be cheered up. He
      mused a while, then he saw his way. He said in his most conspicuously
      casual vein:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Er&mdash;uh&mdash;by the way, Hawkins, we are feeling disappointed about
      this thing&mdash;the way the materializee is acting, I mean&mdash;we are
      disappointed; you concede that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Concede it? Why, yes, if you like the term."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; so far, so good. Now for the basis of the feeling. It is not
      that your heart, your affections are concerned; that is to say, it is not
      that you want the materializee Itself. You concede that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I concede that, too&mdash;cordially."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, again; we are making progress. To sum up: The feeling, it is
      conceded, is not engendered by the mere conduct of the materializee; it is
      conceded that it does not arise from any pang which the personality of the
      materializee could assuage. Now then," said the earl, with the light of
      triumph in his eye, "the inexorable logic of the situation narrows us down
      to this: our feeling has its source in the money-loss involved. Come&mdash;isn't
      that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Goodness knows I concede that, with all my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. When you've found out the source of a disease, you've also
      found out what remedy is required&mdash;just as in this case. In this case
      money is required. And only money."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old, old seduction was in that airy, confident tone and those
      significant words&mdash;usually called pregnant words in books. The old
      answering signs of faith and hope showed up in Hawkins's countenance, and
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only money? Do you mean that you know a way to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Washington, have you the impression that I have no resources but those I
      allow the public and my intimate friends to know about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it likely, do you think, that a man moved by nature and taught by
      experience to keep his affairs to himself and a cautious and reluctant
      tongue in his head, wouldn't be thoughtful enough to keep a few resources
      in reserve for a rainy day, when he's got as many as I have to select
      from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you make me feel so much better already, Colonel!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever been in my laboratory?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it. You see you didn't even know that I had one. Come along. I've
      got a little trick there that I want to show you. I've kept it perfectly
      quiet, not fifty people know anything about it. But that's my way, always
      been my way. Wait till you're ready, that's the idea; and when you're
      ready, zzip!&mdash;let her go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Colonel, I've never seen a man that I've had such unbounded
      confidence in as you. When you say a thing right out, I always feel as if
      that ends it; as if that is evidence, and proof, and everything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old earl was profoundly pleased and touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad you believe in me, Washington; not everybody is so just."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always have believed in you; and I always shall as long as I live."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my boy. You shan't repent it. And you can't." Arrived in the
      "laboratory," the earl continued, "Now, cast your eye around this room&mdash;what
      do you see? Apparently a junk-shop; apparently a hospital connected with a
      patent office&mdash;in reality, the mines of Golconda in disguise! Look at
      that thing there. Now what would you take that thing to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe I could ever imagine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you couldn't. It's my grand adaptation of the phonograph to the
      marine service. You store up profanity in it for use at sea. You know that
      sailors don't fly around worth a cent unless you swear at them&mdash;so
      the mate that can do the best job of swearing is the most valuable man. In
      great emergencies his talent saves the ship. But a ship is a large thing,
      and he can't be everywhere at once; so there have been times when one mate
      has lost a ship which could have been saved if they had had a hundred.
      Prodigious storms, you know. Well, a ship can't afford a hundred mates;
      but she can afford a hundred Cursing Phonographs, and distribute them all
      over the vessel&mdash;and there, you see, she's armed at every point.
      Imagine a big storm, and a hundred of my machines all cursing away at once&mdash;splendid
      spectacle, splendid!&mdash;you couldn't hear yourself think. Ship goes
      through that storm perfectly serene&mdash;she's just as safe as she'd be
      on shore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a wonderful idea. How do you prepare the thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Load it&mdash;simply load it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why you just stand over it and swear into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That loads it, does it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;because every word it collars, it keeps&mdash;keeps it forever.
      Never wears out. Any time you turn the crank, out it'll come. In times of
      great peril, you can reverse it, and it'll swear backwards. That makes a
      sailor hump himself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, I see. Who loads them?&mdash;the mate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if he chooses. Or I'll furnish them already loaded. I can hire an
      expert for $75 a month who will load a hundred and fifty phonographs in
      150 hours, and do it easy. And an expert can furnish a stronger article,
      of course, than the mere average uncultivated mate could. Then you see,
      all the ships of the world will buy them ready loaded&mdash;for I shall
      have them loaded in any language a customer wants. Hawkins, it will work
      the grandest moral reform of the 19th century. Five years from now, all
      the swearing will be done by machinery&mdash;you won't ever hear a profane
      word come from human lips on a ship. Millions of dollars have been spent
      by the churches, in the effort to abolish profanity in the commercial
      marine. Think of it&mdash;my name will live forever in the affections of
      good men as the man, who, solitary and alone, accomplished this noble and
      elevating reform."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, it is grand and beneficent and beautiful. How did you ever come to
      think of it? You have a wonderful mind. How did you say you loaded the
      machine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, it's no trouble&mdash;perfectly simple. If you want to load it up loud
      and strong, you stand right over it and shout. But if you leave it open
      and all set, it'll eavesdrop, so to speak&mdash;that is to say, it will
      load itself up with any sounds that are made within six feet of it. Now
      I'll show you how it works. I had an expert come and load this one up
      yesterday. Hello, it's been left open&mdash;it's too bad&mdash;still I
      reckon it hasn't had much chance to collect irrelevant stuff. All you do
      is to press this button in the floor&mdash;so."
    </p>
    <p>
      The phonograph began to sing in a plaintive voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> There is a boarding-house, far far away,<br /> Where they have ham
      and eggs, 3 times a day. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang it, that ain't it. Somebody's been singing around here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The plaintive song began again, mingled with a low, gradually rising wail
      of cats slowly warming up toward a fight;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> O, how the boarders yell,<br /> When they hear that dinner bell<br />
      They give that landlord&mdash; <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      (momentary outburst of terrific catfight which drowns out one word.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> Three times a day. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      (Renewal of furious catfight for a moment. The plaintive voice on a high
      fierce key, "Scat, you devils"&mdash;and a racket as of flying missiles.)
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, never mind&mdash;let it go. I've got some sailor-profanity down in
      there somewhere, if I could get to it. But it isn't any matter; you see
      how the machine works."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins responded with enthusiasm:
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, it works admirably! I know there's a hundred fortunes in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And mind, the Hawkins family get their share, Washington."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, thanks, thanks; you are just as generous as ever. Ah, it's the
      grandest invention of the age!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, well; we live in wonderful times. The elements are crowded full of
      beneficent forces&mdash;always have been&mdash;and ours is the first
      generation to turn them to account and make them work for us. Why Hawkins,
      everything is useful&mdash;nothing ought ever to be wasted. Now look at
      sewer gas, for instance. Sewer gas has always been wasted, heretofore;
      nobody tried to save up sewer-gas&mdash;you can't name me a man. Ain't
      that so? you know perfectly well it's so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes it is so&mdash;but I never&mdash;er&mdash;I don't quite see why a
      body&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should want to save it up? Well, I'll tell you. Do you see this little
      invention here?&mdash;it's a decomposer&mdash;I call it a decomposer. I
      give you my word of honor that if you show me a house that produces a
      given quantity of sewer-gas in a day, I'll engage to set up my decomposer
      there and make that house produce a hundred times that quantity of
      sewer-gas in less than half an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, but why should you want to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Want to? Listen, and you'll see. My boy, for illuminating purposes and
      economy combined, there's nothing in the world that begins with sewer-gas.
      And really, it don't cost a cent. You put in a good inferior article of
      plumbing,&mdash;such as you find everywhere&mdash;and add my decomposer,
      and there you are. Just use the ordinary gas pipes&mdash;and there your
      expense ends. Think of it. Why, Major, in five years from now you won't
      see a house lighted with anything but sewer-gas. Every physician I talk
      to, recommends it; and every plumber."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't it dangerous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, yes, more or less, but everything is&mdash;coal gas, candles,
      electricity &mdash;there isn't anything that ain't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It lights up well, does it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, magnificently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you given it a good trial?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no, not a first rate one. Polly's prejudiced, and she won't let me
      put it in here; but I'm playing my cards to get it adopted in the
      President's house, and then it'll go&mdash;don't you doubt it. I shall not
      need this one for the present, Washington; you may take it down to some
      boarding-house and give it a trial if you like."

    </p>
    <p>
      Washington shuddered slightly at the suggestion, then his face took on a
      dreamy look and he dropped into a trance of thought. After a little,
      Sellers asked him what he was grinding in his mental mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, this. Have you got some secret project in your head which requires
      a Bank of England back of it to make it succeed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="p184" id="p184"></a>

    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel showed lively astonishment, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Hawkins, are you a mind-reader?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? I never thought of such a thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then how did you happen to drop onto that idea in this curious
      fashion? It's just mind-reading, that's what it is, though you may not
      know it. Because I have got a private project that requires a Bank of
      England at its back. How could you divine that? What was the process? This
      is interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There wasn't any process. A thought like this happened to slip through my
      head by accident: How much would make you or me comfortable? A hundred
      thousand. Yet you are expecting two or three of&mdash;these inventions of
      yours to turn out some billions of money&mdash;and you are wanting them to
      do that. If you wanted ten millions, I could understand that&mdash;it's
      inside the human limits. But billions! That's clear outside the limits.
      There must be a definite project back of that somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl's interest and surprise augmented with every word, and when
      Hawkins finished, he said with strong admiration:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's wonderfully reasoned out, Washington, it certainly is. It shows what
      I think is quite extraordinary penetration. For you've hit it; you've
      driven the centre, you've plugged the bulls-eye of my dream. Now I'll tell
      you the whole thing, and you'll understand it. I don't need to ask you to
      keep it to yourself, because you'll see that the project will prosper all
      the better for being kept in the background till the right time. Have you
      noticed how many pamphlets and books I've got lying around relating to
      Russia?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I think most anybody would notice that&mdash;anybody who wasn't
      dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I've been posting myself a good while. That's a great and, splendid
      nation, and deserves to be set free." He paused, then added in a quite
      matter-of-fact way, "When I get this money I'm going to set it free."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great guns!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what makes you jump like that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear me, when you are going to drop a remark under a man's chair that is
      likely to blow him out through the roof, why don't you put some
      expression, some force, some noise into it that will prepare him? You
      shouldn't flip out such a gigantic thing as this in that colorless kind of
      a way. You do jolt a person up, so. Go on, now, I am all right again. Tell
      me all about it. I'm all interest&mdash;yes, and sympathy, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I've looked the ground over, and concluded that the methods of the
      Russian patriots, while good enough considering the way the boys are
      hampered, are not the best; at least not the quickest. They are trying to
      revolutionize Russia from within; that's pretty slow, you know, and liable
      to interruption all the time, and is full of perils for the workers. Do
      you know how Peter the Great started his army? He didn't start it on the
      family premises under the noses of the Strelitzes; no, he started it away
      off yonder, privately,&mdash;only just one regiment, you know, and he
      built to that. The first thing the Strelitzes knew, the regiment was an
      army, their position was turned, and they had to take a walk. Just that
      little idea made the biggest and worst of all the despotisms the world has
      seen. The same idea can unmake it. I'm going to prove it. I'm going to get
      out to one side and work my scheme the way Peter did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is mighty interesting, Rossmore. What is it you are going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to buy Siberia and start a republic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There,&mdash;bang you go again, without giving any notice! Going to buy
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, as soon as I get the money. I don't care what the price is, I shall
      take it. I can afford it, and I will. Now then, consider this&mdash;and
      you've never thought of it, I'll warrant. Where is the place where there
      is twenty-five times more manhood, pluck, true heroism, unselfishness,
      devotion to high and noble ideals, adoration of liberty, wide education,
      and brains, per thousand of population, than any other domain in the whole
      world can show?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Siberia!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true; it certainly is true, but I never thought of it before."
    </p>

      "Nobody ever thinks of it. But it's so, just the same. In those mines and
      prisons are gathered together the very finest and noblest and capablest
      multitude of human beings that God is able to create. Now if you had that
      kind of a population to sell, would you offer it to a despotism? No, the
      despotism has no use for it; you would lose money. A despotism has no use
      for anything but human cattle. But suppose you want to start a republic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I see. It's just the material for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I should say so! There's Siberia with just the very finest and
      choicest material on the globe for a republic, and more coming&mdash;more
      coming all the time, don't you see! It is being daily, weekly, monthly
      recruited by the most perfectly devised system that has ever been
      invented, perhaps. By this system the whole of the hundred millions of
      Russia are being constantly and patiently sifted, sifted, sifted, by
      myriads of trained experts, spies appointed by the Emperor personally; and
      whenever they catch a man, woman or child that has got any brains or
      education or character, they ship that person straight to Siberia. It is
      admirable, it is wonderful. It is so searching and so effective that it
      keeps the general level of Russian intellect and education down to that of
      the Czar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, that sounds like exaggeration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's what they say anyway. But I think, myself, it's a lie. And it
      doesn't seem right to slander a whole nation that way, anyhow. Now, then,
      you see what the material is, there in Siberia, for a republic." He
      paused, and his breast began to heave and his eye to burn, under the
      impulse of strong emotion. Then his words began to stream forth, with
      constantly increasing energy and fire, and he rose to his feet as if to
      give himself larger freedom. "The minute I organize that republic, the
      light of liberty, intelligence, justice, humanity, bursting from it,
      flooding from it, flaming from it, will concentrate the gaze of the whole
      astonished world as upon the miracle of a new sun; Russia's countless
      multitudes of slaves will rise up and march, march!&mdash;eastward, with
      that great light transfiguring their faces as they come, and far back of
      them you will see-what will you see?&mdash;a vacant throne in an empty
      land! It can be done, and by God I will do it!"

    <p>
      He stood a moment bereft of earthly consciousness by his exaltation; then
      consciousness returned, bringing him a slight shock, and he said with
      grave earnestness:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must ask you to pardon me, Major Hawkins. I have never used that
      expression before, and I beg you will forgive it this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins was quite willing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Washington, it is an error which I am by nature not liable to.
      Only excitable people, impulsive people, are exposed to it. But the
      circumstances of the present case&mdash;I being a democrat by birth and
      preference, and an aristocrat by inheritance and relish&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl stopped suddenly, his frame stiffened, and he began to stare
      speechless through the curtainless window. Then he pointed, and gasped out
      a single rapturous word:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Colonel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "IT!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure as you're born. Keep perfectly still. I'll apply the influence&mdash;I'll
      turn on all my force. I've brought It thus far&mdash;I'll fetch It right
      into the house. You'll see."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was making all sorts of passes in the air with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! Look at that. I've made It smile! See?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite true. Tracy, out for an afternoon stroll, had come unexpectantly
      upon his family arms displayed upon this shabby house-front. The
      hatchments made him smile; which was nothing, they had made the
      neighborhood cats do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, Hawkins, look! I'm drawing It over!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're drawing it sure, Rossmore. If I ever had any doubts about
      materialization, they're gone, now, and gone for good. Oh, this is a
      joyful day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy was sauntering over to read the door-plate. Before he was half way
      over he was saying to himself, "Why, manifestly these are the American
      Claimant's quarters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's coming&mdash;coming right along. I'll slide, down and pull It in.
      You follow after me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sellers, pale and a good deal agitated, opened the door and confronted
      Tracy. The old man could not at once get his voice: then he pumped out a
      scattering and hardly coherent salutation, and followed it with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Walk in, walk right in, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tracy&mdash;Howard Tracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tracy&mdash;thanks&mdash;walk right in, you're expected."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy entered, considerably puzzled, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Expected? I think there must be some mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I judge not," said Sellers, who&mdash;noticing that Hawkins had
      arrived, gave him a sidewise glance intended to call his close attention
      to a dramatic effect which he was proposing to produce by his next remark.
      Then he said, slowly and impressively&mdash;"I am&mdash;YOU KNOW WHO."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the astonishment of both conspirators the remark produced no dramatic
      effect at all; for the new-comer responded with a quite innocent and
      unembarrassed air&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, pardon me. I don't know who you are. I only suppose&mdash;but no
      doubt correctly&mdash;that you are the gentleman whose title is on the
      doorplate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right, quite right&mdash;sit down, pray sit down." The earl was rattled,
      thrown off his bearings, his head was in a whirl. Then he noticed Hawkins
      standing apart and staring idiotically at what to him was the apparition
      of a defunct man, and a new idea was born to him. He said to Tracy
      briskly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a thousand pardons, dear sir, I am forgetting courtesies due to a
      guest and stranger. Let me introduce my friend General Hawkins&mdash;General
      Hawkins, our new Senator&mdash;Senator from the latest and grandest
      addition to the radiant galaxy of sovereign States, Cherokee Strip"&mdash;(to
      himself, "that name will shrivel him up!"&mdash;but it didn't, in the
      least, and the Colonel resumed the introduction piteously disheartened and
      amazed),&mdash;"Senator Hawkins, Mr. Howard Tracy, of&mdash;er&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "England!&mdash;Why that's im&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "England, yes, native of England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Recently from there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, quite recently."
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the Colonel to himself, "This phantom lies like an expert. Purifying
      this kind by fire don't work. I'll sound him a little further, give him
      another chance or two to work his gift." Then aloud&mdash;with deep irony&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Visiting our great country for recreation and amusement, no doubt. I
      suppose you find that traveling in the majestic expanses of our Far West
      is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't been West, and haven't been devoting myself to amusement with
      any sort of exclusiveness, I assure you. In fact, to merely live, an
      artist has got to work, not play."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Artist!" said Hawkins to himself, thinking of the rifled bank; "that is a
      name for it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you an artist?" asked the colonel; and added to himself, "now I'm
      going to catch him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a humble way, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What line?" pursued the sly veteran.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oils."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got him!" said Sellers to himself. Then aloud, "This is fortunate.
      Could I engage you to restore some of my paintings that need that
      attention?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be very glad. Pray let me see them."
    </p>
    <p>
      No shuffling, no evasion, no embarrassment, even under this crucial test.
      The Colonel was nonplussed. He led Tracy to a chromo which had suffered
      damage in a former owner's hands through being used as a lamp mat, and
      said, with a flourish of his hand toward the picture&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "This del Sarto&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that a del Sarto?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel bent a look of reproach upon Tracy, allowed it to sink home,
      then resumed as if there had been no interruption&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "This del Sarto is perhaps the only original of that sublime master in our
      country. You see, yourself, that the work is of such exceeding delicacy
      that the risk&mdash;could&mdash;er&mdash;would you mind giving me a little
      example of what you can do before we&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheerfully, cheerfully. I will copy one of these marvels."
    </p>
    <p>
      Water-color materials&mdash;relics of Miss Sally's college life&mdash;were
      brought. Tracy said he was better in oils, but would take a chance with
      these. So he was left alone. He began his work, but the attractions of the
      place were too strong for him, and he got up and went drifting about,
      fascinated; also amazed.

      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the earl and Hawkins were holding a troubled and anxious private
      consultation. The earl said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mystery that bothers me, is, where did It get its other arm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;it worries me, too. And another thing troubles me&mdash;the
      apparition is English. How do you account for that, Colonel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honestly, I don't know, Hawkins, I don't really know. It is very
      confusing and awful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think maybe we've waked up the wrong one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The wrong one? How do you account for the clothes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The clothes are right, there's no getting around it. What are we going to
      do? We can't collect, as I see. The reward is for a one-armed American.
      This is a two-armed Englishman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it may be that that is not objectionable. You see it isn't less
      than is called for, it is more, and so,&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he saw that this argument was weak, and dropped it. The friends sat
      brooding over their perplexities some time in silence. Finally the earl's
      face began to glow with an inspiration, and he said, impressively:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hawkins, this materialization is a grander and nobler science than we
      have dreamed of. We have little imagined what a solemn and stupendous
      thing we have done. The whole secret is perfectly clear to me, now, clear
      as day. Every man is made up of heredities, long-descended atoms and
      particles of his ancestors. This present materialization is incomplete. We
      have only brought it down to perhaps the beginning of this century."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, Colonel!" cried Hawkins, filled with vague alarms by
      the old man's awe-compelling words and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This. We've materialized this burglar's ancestor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't&mdash;don't say that. It's hideous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's true, Hawkins, I know it. Look at the facts. This apparition is
      distinctly English&mdash;note that. It uses good grammar&mdash;note that.
      It is an Artist&mdash;note that. It has the manners and carriage of a
      gentleman&mdash;note that. Where's your cow-boy? Answer me that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rossmore, this is dreadful&mdash;it's too dreadful to think of!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never resurrected a rag of that burglar but the clothes, not a solitary
      rag of him but the clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colonel, do you really mean&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel brought his fist down with emphasis and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean exactly this. This materialization was immature, the burglar has
      evaded us, this is nothing but a damned ancestor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and walked the floor in great excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins said plaintively:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a bitter disappointment&mdash;bitter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it. I know it, Senator; I feel it as deeply as anybody could. But
      we've got to submit&mdash;on moral grounds. I need money, but God knows I
      am not poor enough or shabby enough to be an accessory to the punishing of
      a man's ancestor for crimes committed by that ancestor's posterity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Colonel!" implored Hawkins; "stop and think; don't be rash; you know
      it's the only chance we've got to get the money; and besides, the Bible
      itself says posterity to the fourth generation shall be punished for the
      sins and crimes committed by ancestors four generations back that hadn't
      anything to do with them; and so it's only fair to turn the rule around
      and make it work both ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel was struck with the strong logic of this position. He strode
      up and down, and thought it painfully over. Finally he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's reason in it; yes, there's reason in it. And so, although it
      seems a piteous thing to sweat this poor ancient devil for a burglary he
      hadn't the least hand in, still if duty commands I suppose we must give
      him up to the authorities."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would," said Hawkins, cheered and relieved, "I'd give him up if he was
      a thousand ancestors compacted into one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord bless me, that's just what he is," said Sellers, with something like
      a groan, "it's exactly what he is; there's a contribution in him from
      every ancestor he ever had. In him there's atoms of priests, soldiers,
      crusaders, poets, and sweet and gracious women&mdash;all kinds and
      conditions of folk who trod this earth in old, old centuries, and vanished
      out of it ages ago, and now by act of ours they are summoned from their
      holy peace to answer for gutting a one-horse bank away out on the borders
      of Cherokee Strip, and it's just a howling outrage!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't talk like that, Colonel; it takes the heart all out of me, and
      makes me ashamed of the part I am proposing to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait&mdash;I've got it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A saving hope? Shout it out, I am perishing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's perfectly simple; a child would have thought of it. He is all right,
      not a flaw in him, as far as I have carried the work. If I've been able to
      bring him as far as the beginning of this century, what's to stop me now?
      I'll go on and materialize him down to date."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Land, I never thought of that!" said Hawkins all ablaze with joy again.
      "It's the very thing. What a brain you have got! And will he shed the
      superfluous arm?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And lose his English accent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will wholly disappear. He will speak Cherokee Strip&mdash;and other
      forms of profanity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colonel, maybe he'll confess!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confess? Merely that bank robbery?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Merely? Yes, but why 'merely'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel said in his most impressive manner: "Hawkins, he will be
      wholly under my command. I will make him confess every crime he ever
      committed. There must be a thousand. Do you get the idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&mdash;not quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rewards will come to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prodigious conception! I never saw such a head for seeing with a
      lightning glance all the outlying ramifications and possibilities of a
      central idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is nothing; it comes natural to me. When his time is out in one jail
      he goes to the next and the next, and we shall have nothing to do but
      collect the rewards as he goes along. It is a perfectly steady income as
      long as we live, Hawkins. And much better than other kinds of investments,
      because he is indestructible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks&mdash;it really does look the way you say; it does indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look?&mdash;why it is. It will not be denied that I have had a pretty
      wide and comprehensive financial experience, and I do not hesitate to say
      that I consider this one of the most valuable properties I have ever
      controlled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, Colonel, the wasting grind and grief of poverty! If we could realize
      immediately. I don't mean sell it all, but sell part&mdash;enough, you
      know, to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See how you tremble with excitement. That comes of lack of experience. My
      boy, when you have been familiar with vast operations as long as I have,
      you'll be different. Look at me; is my eye dilated? do you notice a quiver
      anywhere? Feel my pulse: plunk-plunk-plunk&mdash;same as if I were asleep.
      And yet, what is passing through my calm cold mind? A procession of
      figures which would make a financial novice drunk just the sight of them.
      Now it is by keeping cool, and looking at a thing all around, that a man
      sees what's really in it, and saves himself from the novice's unfailing
      mistake&mdash;the one you've just suggested&mdash;eagerness to realize.
      Listen to me. Your idea is to sell a part of him for ready cash. Now mine
      is&mdash;guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I haven't an idea. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stock him&mdash;of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I should never have thought of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you are not a financier. Say he has committed a thousand crimes.
      Certainly that's a low estimate. By the look of him, even in his
      unfinished condition, he has committed all of a million. But call it only
      a thousand to be perfectly safe; five thousand reward, multiplied by a
      thousand, gives us a dead sure cash basis of&mdash;what? Five million
      dollars!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait&mdash;let me get my breath."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the property indestructible. Perpetually fruitful&mdash;perpetually;
      for a property with his disposition will go on committing crimes and
      winning rewards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You daze me, you make my head whirl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let it whirl, it won't do it any harm. Now that matter is all fixed&mdash;leave
      it alone. I'll get up the company and issue the stock, all in good time.
      Just leave it in my hands. I judge you don't doubt my ability to work it
      up for all it is worth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I don't. I can say that with truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, then. That's disposed of. Everything in its turn. We old
      operators, go by order and system&mdash;no helter-skelter business with
      us. What's the next thing on the docket? The carrying on of the
      materialization&mdash;the bringing it down to date. I will begin on that
      at once. I think&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Rossmore. You didn't lock It in. A hundred to one it has
      escaped!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Calm yourself, as to that; don't give yourself any uneasiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why shouldn't it escape?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let it, if it wants to. What of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I should consider it a pretty serious calamity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear boy, once in my power, always in my power. It may go and
      come freely. I can produce it here whenever I want it, just by the
      exercise of my will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am truly glad to hear that, I do assure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I shall give it all the painting it wants to do, and we and the
      family will make it as comfortable and contented as we can. No occasion to
      restrain its movements. I hope to persuade it to remain pretty quiet,
      though, because a materialization which is in a state of arrested
      development must of necessity be pretty soft and flabby and substanceless,
      and&mdash;er&mdash;by the way, I wonder where It comes from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How? What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl pointed significantly&mdash;and interrogatively toward the sky.
      Hawkins started; then settled into deep reflection; finally shook his head
      sorrowfully and pointed downwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you think so, Washington?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I hardly know, but really you can see, yourself, that he doesn't
      seem to be pining for his last place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's well thought! Soundly deduced. We've done that Thing a favor. But I
      believe I will pump it a little, in a quiet way, and find out if we are
      right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long is it going to take to finish him off and fetch him down to
      date, Colonel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I knew, but I don't. I am clear knocked out by this new detail&mdash;this
      unforeseen necessity of working a subject down gradually from his
      condition of ancestor to his ultimate result as posterity. But I'll make
      him hump himself, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rossmore!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, dear. We're in the laboratory. Come&mdash;Hawkins is here. Mind, now
      Hawkins&mdash;he's a sound, living, human being to all the family&mdash;don't
      forget that. Here she comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your seats, I'm not coming in. I just wanted to ask, who is it
      that's painting down there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That? Oh, that's a young artist; young Englishman, named Tracy; very
      promising&mdash;favorite pupil of Hans Christian Andersen or one of the
      other old masters&mdash;Andersen I'm pretty sure it is; he's going to
      half-sole some of our old Italian masterpieces. Been talking to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, only a word. I stumbled right in on him without expecting anybody
      was there. I tried to be polite to him; offered him a snack"&mdash;(Sellers
      delivered a large wink to Hawkins from behind his hand), "but he declined,
      and said he wasn't hungry" (another sarcastic wink); "so I brought some
      apples" (doublewink), "and he ate a couple of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" and the colonel sprang some yards toward the ceiling and came down
      quaking with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Rossmore was smitten dumb with amazement. She gazed at the sheepish
      relic of Cherokee Strip, then at her husband, and then at the guest again.
      Finally she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter with you, Mulberry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer immediately. His back was turned; he was bending over
      his chair, feeling the seat of it. But he answered next moment, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there it is; it was a tack."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady contemplated him doubtfully a moment, then said, pretty
      snappishly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that for a tack! Praise goodness it wasn't a shingle nail, it would
      have landed you in the Milky Way. I do hate to have my nerves shook up
      so." And she turned on her heel and went her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she was safely out, the Colonel said, in a suppressed voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come&mdash;we must see for ourselves. It must be a mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      They hurried softly down and peeped in. Sellers whispered, in a sort of
      despair&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is eating! What a grisly spectacle! Hawkins it's horrible! Take me away&mdash;I
      can't stand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They tottered back to the laboratory.

      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy made slow progress with his work, for his mind wandered a good deal.
      Many things were puzzling him. Finally a light burst upon him all of a
      sudden&mdash;seemed to, at any rate&mdash;and he said to himself, "I've
      got the clew at last&mdash;this man's mind is off its balance; I don't
      know how much, but it's off a point or two, sure; off enough to explain
      this mess of perplexities, anyway. These dreadful chromos which he takes
      for old masters; these villainous portraits&mdash;which to his frantic
      mind represent Rossmores; the hatchments; the pompous name of this
      ramshackle old crib&mdash;Rossmore Towers; and that odd assertion of his,
      that I was expected. How could I be expected? that is, Lord Berkeley. He
      knows by the papers that that person was burned up in the New Gadsby. Why,
      hang it, he really doesn't know who he was expecting; for his talk showed
      that he was not expecting an Englishman, or yet an artist, yet I answer
      his requirements notwithstanding. He seems sufficiently satisfied with me.
      Yes, he is a little off; in fact I am afraid he is a good deal off, poor
      old gentleman. But he's interesting&mdash;all people in about his
      condition are, I suppose. I hope he'll like my work; I would like to come
      every day and study him. And when I write my father&mdash;ah, that hurts!
      I mustn't get on that subject; it isn't good for my spirits. Somebody
      coming&mdash;I must get to work. It's the old gentleman again. He looks
      bothered. Maybe my clothes are suspicious; and they are&mdash;for an
      artist. If my conscience would allow me to make a change, but that is out
      of the question. I wonder what he's making those passes in the air for,
      with his hands. I seem to be the object of them. Can he be trying to
      mesmerize me? I don't quite like it. There's something uncanny about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel muttered to himself, "It has an effect on him, I can see it
      myself. That's enough for one time, I reckon. He's not very solid, yet, I
      suppose, and I might disintegrate him. I'll just put a sly question or two
      at him, now, and see if I can find out what his condition is, and where
      he's from."
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached and said affably:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let me disturb you, Mr. Tracy; I only want to take a little glimpse
      of your work. Ah, that's fine&mdash;that's very fine indeed. You are doing
      it elegantly. My daughter will be charmed with this. May I sit down by
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do; I shall be glad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't disturb you? I mean, won't dissipate your inspirations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy laughed and said they were not ethereal enough to be very easily
      discommoded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel asked a number of cautious and well-considered questions&mdash;questions
      which seemed pretty odd and flighty to Tracy&mdash;but the answers
      conveyed the information desired, apparently, for the colonel said to
      himself, with mixed pride and gratification:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a good job as far as I've got with it. He's solid. Solid and going
      to last, solid as the real thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's wonderful&mdash;wonderful. I believe I could&mdash;petrify him."
      After a little he asked, warily "Do you prefer being here, or&mdash;or
      there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There? Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;er&mdash;where you've been?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy's thought flew to his boarding-house, and he answered with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, here, much!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel was startled, and said to himself, "There's no uncertain ring
      about that. It indicates where he's been to, poor fellow. Well, I am
      satisfied, now. I'm glad I got him out."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat thinking, and thinking, and watching the brush go. At length he
      said to himself, "Yes, it certainly seems to account for the failure of my
      endeavors in poor Berkeley's case. He went in the other direction. Well,
      it's all right. He's better off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally Sellers entered from the street, now, looking her divinest, and the
      artist was introduced to her. It was a violent case of mutual love at
      first sight, though neither party was entirely aware of the fact, perhaps.
      The Englishman made this irrelevant remark to himself, "Perhaps he is not
      insane, after all." Sally sat down, and showed an interest in Tracy's work
      which greatly pleased him, and a benevolent forgiveness of it which
      convinced him that the girl's nature was cast in a large mould. Sellers
      was anxious to report his discoveries to Hawkins; so he took his leave,
      saying that if the two "young devotees of the colored Muse" thought they
      could manage without him, he would go and look after his affairs. The
      artist said to himself, "I think he is a little eccentric, perhaps, but
      that is all." He reproached himself for having injuriously judged a man
      without giving him any fair chance to show what he really was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="p204" id="p204"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">

      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the stranger was very soon at his ease and chatting along
      comfortably. The average American girl possesses the valuable qualities of
      naturalness, honesty, and inoffensive straightforwardness; she is nearly
      barren of troublesome conventions and artificialities, consequently her
      presence and her ways are unembarrassing, and one is acquainted with her
      and on the pleasantest terms with her before he knows how it came about.
      This new acquaintanceship&mdash;friendship, indeed&mdash;progressed
      swiftly; and the unusual swiftness of it, and the thoroughness of it are
      sufficiently evidenced and established by one noteworthy fact&mdash;that
      within the first half hour both parties had ceased to be conscious of
      Tracy's clothes. Later this consciousness was re-awakened; it was then
      apparent to Gwendolen that she was almost reconciled to them, and it was
      apparent to Tracy that he wasn't. The re-awakening was brought about by
      Gwendolen's inviting the artist to stay to dinner. He had to decline,
      because he wanted to live, now&mdash;that is, now that there was something
      to live for&mdash;and he could not survive in those clothes at a
      gentleman's table. He thought he knew that. But he went away happy, for he
      saw that Gwendolen was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And whither did he go? He went straight to a slopshop and bought as neat
      and reasonably well-fitting a suit of clothes as an Englishman could be
      persuaded to wear. He said&mdash;to himself, but at his conscience&mdash;"I
      know it's wrong; but it would be wrong not to do it; and two wrongs do not
      make a right."
    </p>
    <p>
      This satisfied him, and made his heart light. Perhaps it will also satisfy
      the reader&mdash;if he can make out what it means.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old people were troubled about Gwendolen at dinner, because she was so
      distraught and silent. If they had noticed, they would have found that she
      was sufficiently alert and interested whenever the talk stumbled upon the
      artist and his work; but they didn't notice, and so the chat would swap
      around to some other subject, and then somebody would presently be
      privately worrying about Gwendolen again, and wondering if she were not
      well, or if something had gone wrong in the millinery line. Her mother
      offered her various reputable patent medicines, and tonics with iron and
      other hardware in them, and her father even proposed to send out for wine,
      relentless prohibitionist and head of the order in the District of
      Columbia as he was, but these kindnesses were all declined&mdash;thankfully,
      but with decision. At bedtime, when the family were breaking up for the
      night, she privately looted one of the brushes, saying to herself, "It's
      the one he has used, the most."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Tracy went forth wearing his new suit, and equipped with
      a pink in his button-hole&mdash;a daily attention from Puss. His whole
      soul was full of Gwendolen Sellers, and this condition was an inspiration,
      art-wise. All the morning his brush pawed nimbly away at the canvases,
      almost without his awarity&mdash;awarity, in this sense being the sense of
      being aware, though disputed by some authorities&mdash;turning out marvel
      upon marvel, in the way of decorative accessories to the portraits, with a
      felicity and celerity which amazed the veterans of the firm and fetched
      out of them continuous explosions of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Gwendolen was losing her morning, and many dollars. She supposed
      Tracy was coming in the forenoon&mdash;a conclusion which she had jumped
      to without outside help. So she tripped down stairs every little while
      from her work-parlor to arrange the brushes and things over again, and see
      if he had arrived. And when she was in her work-parlor it was not
      profitable, but just the other way&mdash;as she found out to her sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had put in her idle moments during the last little while back, in
      designing a particularly rare and capable gown for herself, and this
      morning she set about making it up; but she was absent minded, and made an
      irremediable botch of it. When she saw what she had done, she knew the
      reason of it and the meaning of it; and she put her work away from her and
      said she would accept the sign. And from that time forth she came no more
      away from the Audience Chamber, but remained there and waited. After
      luncheon she waited again. A whole hour. Then a great joy welled up in her
      heart, for she saw him coming. So she flew back up stairs thankful, and
      could hardly wait for him to miss the principal brush, which she had
      mislaid down there, but knew where she had mislaid it. However, all in
      good time the others were called in and couldn't find the brush, and then
      she was sent for, and she couldn't find it herself for some little time;
      but then she found it when the others had gone away to hunt in the kitchen
      and down cellar and in the woodshed, and all those other places where
      people look for things whose ways they are not familiar with. So she gave
      him the brush, and remarked that she ought to have seen that everything
      was ready for him, but it hadn't seemed necessary, because it was so early
      that she wasn't expecting&mdash;but she stopped there, surprised at
      herself for what she was saying; and he felt caught and ashamed, and said
      to himself, "I knew my impatience would drag me here before I was
      expected, and betray me, and that is just what it has done; she sees
      straight through me&mdash;and is laughing at me, inside, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was very much pleased, on one account, and a little the other
      way in another; pleased with the new clothes and the improvement which
      they had achieved; less pleased by the pink in the buttonhole. Yesterday's
      pink had hardly interested her; this one was just like it, but somehow it
      had got her immediate attention, and kept it. She wished she could think
      of some way of getting at its history in a properly colorless and
      indifferent way. Presently she made a venture. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever a man's age may be, he can reduce it several years by putting a
      bright-colored flower in his button-hole. I have often noticed that. Is
      that your sex's reason for wearing a boutonniere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy not, but certainly that reason would be a sufficient one. I've
      never heard of the idea before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to prefer pinks. Is it on account of the color, or the form?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh no," he said, simply, "they are given to me. I don't think I have any
      preference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are given to him," she said to herself, and she felt a coldness
      toward that pink. "I wonder who it is, and what she is like." The flower
      began to take up a good deal of room; it obtruded itself everywhere, it
      intercepted all views, and marred them; it was becoming exceedingly
      annoying and conspicuous for a little thing. "I wonder if he cares for
      her." That thought gave her a quite definite pain.

    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She had made everything comfortable for the artist; there was no further
      pretext for staying. So she said she would go, now, and asked him to
      summon the servants in case he should need anything. She went away
      unhappy; and she left unhappiness behind her; for she carried away all the
      sunshine. The time dragged heavily for both, now. He couldn't paint for
      thinking of her; she couldn't design or millinerize with any heart, for
      thinking of him. Never before had painting seemed so empty to him, never
      before had millinerizing seemed so void of interest to her. She had gone
      without repeating that dinner-invitation&mdash;an almost unendurable
      disappointment to him. On her part-well, she was suffering, too; for she
      had found she couldn't invite him. It was not hard yesterday, but it was
      impossible to-day. A thousand innocent privileges seemed to have been
      filched from her unawares in the past twenty-four hours. To-day she felt
      strangely hampered, restrained of her liberty. To-day she couldn't propose
      to herself to do anything or say anything concerning this young man
      without being instantly paralyzed into non-action by the fear that he
      might "suspect." Invite him to dinner to-day? It made her shiver to think
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so her afternoon was one long fret. Broken at intervals. Three times
      she had to go down stairs on errands&mdash;that is, she thought she had to
      go down stairs on errands. Thus, going and coming, she had six glimpses of
      him, in the aggregate, without seeming to look in his direction; and she
      tried to endure these electric ecstasies without showing any sign, but
      they fluttered her up a good deal, and she felt that the naturalness she
      was putting on was overdone and quite too frantically sober and
      hysterically calm to deceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter had his share of the rapture; he had his six glimpses, and
      they smote him with waves of pleasure that assaulted him, beat upon him,
      washed over him deliciously, and drowned out all consciousness of what he
      was doing with his brush. So there were six places in his canvas which had
      to be done over again.

    <p>
      At last Gwendolen got some peace of mind by sending word to the Thompsons,
      in the neighborhood, that she was coming there to dinner. She wouldn't be
      reminded, at that table, that there was an absentee who ought to be a
      presentee&mdash;a word which she meant to look out in the dictionary at a
      calmer time.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time the old earl dropped in for a chat with the artist, and
      invited him to stay to dinner. Tracy cramped down his joy and gratitude by
      a sudden and powerful exercise of all his forces; and he felt that now
      that he was going to be close to Gwendolen, and hear her voice and watch
      her face during several precious hours, earth had nothing valuable to add
      to his life for the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earl said to himself, "This spectre can eat apples, apparently. We
      shall find out, now, if that is a specialty. I think, myself, it's a
      specialty. Apples, without doubt, constitute the spectral limit. It was
      the case with our first parents. No, I am wrong&mdash;at least only partly
      right. The line was drawn at apples, just as in the present case, but it
      was from the other direction." The new clothes gave him a thrill of
      pleasure and pride. He said to himself, "I've got part of him down to
      date, anyway."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sellers said he was pleased with Tracy's work; and he went on and engaged
      him to restore his old masters, and said he should also want him to paint
      his portrait and his wife's and possibly his daughter's. The tide of the
      artist's happiness was at flood, now. The chat flowed pleasantly along
      while Tracy painted and Sellers carefully unpacked a picture which he had
      brought with him. It was a chromo; a new one, just out. It was the
      smirking, self-satisfied portrait of a man who was inundating the Union
      with advertisements inviting everybody to buy his specialty, which was a
      three-dollar shoe or a dress-suit or something of that kind. The old
      gentleman rested the chromo flat upon his lap and gazed down tenderly upon
      it, and became silent and meditative. Presently Tracy noticed that he was
      dripping tears on it. This touched the young fellow's sympathetic nature,
      and at the same time gave him the painful sense of being an intruder upon
      a sacred privacy, an observer of emotions which a stranger ought not to
      witness. But his pity rose superior to other considerations, and compelled
      him to try to comfort the old mourner with kindly words and a show of
      friendly interest. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very sorry&mdash;is it a friend whom&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, more than that, far more than that&mdash;a relative, the dearest I
      had on earth, although I was never permitted to see him. Yes, it is young
      Lord Berkeley, who perished so heroically in the awful conflagration. Why
      what is the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing, nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a little startling to be so suddenly brought face to face, so to
      speak, with a person one has heard so much talk about. Is it a good
      likeness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without doubt, yes. I never saw him, but you can easily see the
      resemblance to his father," said Sellers, holding up the chromo and
      glancing from it to the chromo misrepresenting the Usurping Earl and back
      again with an approving eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no&mdash;I am not sure that I make out the likeness. It is plain
      that the Usurping Earl there has a great deal of character and a long face
      like a horse's, whereas his heir here is smirky, moon-faced and
      characterless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are all that way in the beginning&mdash;all the line," said Sellers,
      undisturbed. "We all start as moonfaced fools, then later we tadpole along
      into horse-faced marvels of intellect and character. It is by that sign
      and by that fact that I detect the resemblance here and know this portrait
      to be genuine and perfect. Yes, all our family are fools at first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This young man seems to meet the hereditary requirement, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, he was a fool, without any doubt. Examine the face, the shape
      of the head, the expression. It's all fool, fool, fool, straight through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks,&mdash;" said Tracy, involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean for explaining it to me. Go on, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I was saying, fool is printed all over the face. A body can even read
      the details."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do they say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, added up, he is a wobbler."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A which?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wobbler. A person that's always taking a firm stand about something or
      other&mdash;kind of a Gibraltar stand, he thinks, for unshakable fidelity
      and everlastingness&mdash;and then, inside of a little while, he begins to
      wobble; no more Gibraltar there; no, sir, a mighty ordinary commonplace
      weakling wobbling around on stilts. That's Lord Berkeley to a dot, you can
      see it&mdash;look at that sheep! But,&mdash;why are you blushing like
      sunset! Dear sir, have I unwittingly offended in some way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no indeed, no indeed. Far from it. But it always makes me blush to
      hear a man revile his own blood." He said to himself, "How strangely his
      vagrant and unguided fancies have hit upon the truth. By accident, he has
      described me. I am that contemptible thing. When I left England I thought
      I knew myself; I thought I was a very Frederick the Great for resolution
      and staying capacity; whereas in truth I am just a Wobbler, simply a
      Wobbler. Well&mdash;after all, it is at least creditable to have high
      ideals and give birth to lofty resolutions; I will allow myself that
      comfort." Then he said, aloud, "Could this sheep, as you call him, breed a
      great and self-sacrificing idea in his head, do you think? Could he
      meditate such a thing, for instance, as the renunciation of the earldom
      and its wealth and its glories, and voluntary retirement to the ranks of
      the commonalty, there to rise by his own merit or remain forever poor and
      obscure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could he? Why, look at him&mdash;look at this simpering self-righteous
      mug! There is your answer. It's the very thing he would think of. And he
      would start in to do it, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'd wobble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And back down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that to happen with all my&mdash;I mean would that happen to all his
      high resolutions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh certainly&mdash;certainly. It's the Rossmore of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then this creature was fortunate to die! Suppose, for argument's sake,
      that I was a Rossmore, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It can't be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it's not a supposable case. To be a Rossmore at your age, you'd
      have to be a fool, and you're not a fool. And you'd have to be a Wobbler,
      whereas anybody that is an expert in reading character can see at a glance
      that when you set your foot down once, it's there to stay; and earthquake
      can't wobble it." He added to himself, "That's enough to say to him, but
      it isn't half strong enough for the facts. The more I observe him, now,
      the more remarkable I find him. It is the strongest face I have ever
      examined. There is almost superhuman firmness here, immovable purpose,
      iron steadfastness of will. A most extraordinary young man."
    </p>
    <p>
      He presently said, aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some time I want to ask your advice about a little matter, Mr. Tracy. You
      see, I've got that young lord's remains&mdash;my goodness, how you jump!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it's nothing, pray go on. You've got his remains?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure they are his, and not somebody else's?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, perfectly sure. Samples, I mean. Not all of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Samples?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;in baskets. Some time you will be going home; and if you
      wouldn't mind taking them along&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who? I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;certainly. I don't mean now; but after a while; after&mdash;but
      look here, would you like to see them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! Most certainly not. I don't want to see them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, very well. I only thought&mdash;hey, where are you going, dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out to dinner, papa."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy was aghast. The colonel said, in a disappointed voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm sorry. Sho, I didn't know she was going out, Mr. Tracy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen's face began to take on a sort of apprehensive 'What-have-I-done
      expression.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three old people to one young one&mdash;well, it isn't a good team,
      that's a fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen's face betrayed a dawning hopefulness and she said&mdash;with a
      tone of reluctance which hadn't the hall-mark on it:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you prefer, I will send word to the Thompsons that I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, is it the Thompsons? That simplifies it&mdash;sets everything right.
      We can fix it without spoiling your arrangements, my child. You've got
      your heart set on&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But papa, I'd just as soon go there some other&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No&mdash;I won't have it. You are a good hard-working darling child, and
      your father is not the man to disappoint you when you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But papa, I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go along, I won't hear a word. We'll get along, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gwendolen was ready to cry with vexation. But there was nothing to do but
      start; which she was about to do when her father hit upon an idea which
      filled him with delight because it so deftly covered all the difficulties
      of the situation and made things smooth and satisfactory:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got it, my love, so that you won't be robbed of your holiday and at
      the same time we'll be pretty satisfactorily fixed for a good time here.
      You send Belle Thompson here&mdash;perfectly beautiful creature, Tracy,
      perfectly beautiful; I want you to see that girl; why, you'll just go mad;
      you'll go mad inside of a minute; yes, you send her right along,
      Gwendolen, and tell her&mdash;why, she's gone!" He turned&mdash;she was
      already passing out at the gate. He muttered, "I wonder what's the matter;
      I don't know what her mouth's doing, but I think her shoulders are
      swearing. Well," said Sellers blithely to Tracy, "I shall miss her&mdash;parents
      always miss the children as soon as they're out of sight, it's only a
      natural and wisely ordained partiality&mdash;but you'll be all right,
      because Miss Belle will supply the youthful element for you and to your
      entire content; and we old people will do our best, too. We shall have a
      good enough time. And you'll have a chance to get better acquainted with
      Admiral Hawkins. That's a rare character, Mr. Tracy&mdash;one of the
      rarest and most engaging characters the world has produced. You'll find
      him worth studying. I've studied him ever since he was a child and have
      always found him developing. I really consider that one of the main things
      that have enabled me to master the difficult science of character-reading
      was the vivid interest I always felt in that boy and the baffling
      inscrutabilities of his ways and inspirations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy was not hearing a word. His spirits were gone, he was desolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a most wonderful character. Concealment&mdash;that's the basis of
      it. Always the first thing you want to do is to find the keystone a man's
      character is built on&mdash;then you've got it. No misleading and
      apparently inconsistent peculiarities can fool you then. What do you read
      on the Senator's surface? Simplicity; a kind of rank and protuberant
      simplicity; whereas, in fact, that's one of the deepest minds in the
      world. A perfectly honest man&mdash;an absolutely honest and honorable man&mdash;and
      yet without doubt the profoundest master of dissimulation the world has
      ever seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, it's devilish!" This was wrung from the unlistening Tracy by the
      anguished thought of what might have been if only the dinner arrangements
      hadn't got mixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I shouldn't call it that," said Sellers, who was now placidly walking
      up and down the room with his hands under his coat-tails and listening to
      himself talk. "One could quite properly call it devilish in another man,
      but not in the Senator. Your term is right&mdash;perfectly right&mdash;I
      grant that&mdash;but the application is wrong. It makes a great
      difference. Yes, he is a marvelous character. I do not suppose that any
      other statesman ever had such a colossal sense of humor, combined with the
      ability to totally conceal it. I may except George Washington and
      Cromwell, and perhaps Robespierre, but I draw the line there. A person not
      an expert might be in Judge Hawkins's company a lifetime and never find
      out he had any more sense of humor than a cemetery."
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep-drawn yard-long sigh from the distraught and dreaming artist,
      followed by a murmured, "Miserable, oh, miserable!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no, I shouldn't say that about it, quite. On the contrary, I admire
      his ability to conceal his humor even more if possible than I admire the
      gift itself, stupendous as it is. Another thing&mdash;General Hawkins is a
      thinker; a keen, logical, exhaustive, analytical thinker&mdash;perhaps the
      ablest of modern times. That is, of course, upon themes suited to his
      size, like the glacial period, and the correlation of forces, and the
      evolution of the Christian from the caterpillar&mdash;any of those things;
      give him a subject according to his size, and just stand back and watch
      him think! Why you can see the place rock! Ah, yes, you must know him; you
      must get on the inside of him. Perhaps the most extraordinary mind since
      Aristotle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was kept waiting for a while for Miss Thompson, but as Gwendolen
      had not delivered the invitation to her the waiting did no good, and the
      household presently went to the meal without her. Poor old Sellers tried
      everything his hospitable soul could devise to make the occasion an
      enjoyable one for the guest, and the guest tried his honest best to be
      cheery and chatty and happy for the old gentleman's sake; in fact all
      hands worked hard in the interest of a mutual good time, but the thing was
      a failure from the start; Tracy's heart was lead in his bosom, there
      seemed to be only one prominent feature in the landscape and that was a
      vacant chair, he couldn't drag his mind away from Gwendolen and his hard
      luck; consequently his distractions allowed deadly pauses to slip in every
      now and then when it was his turn to say something, and of course this
      disease spread to the rest of the conversation&mdash;wherefore, instead of
      having a breezy sail in sunny waters, as anticipated, everybody was
      bailing out and praying for land. What could the matter be? Tracy alone
      could have told, the others couldn't even invent a theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile they were having a similarly dismal time at the Thompson house;
      in fact a twin experience. Gwendolen was ashamed of herself for allowing
      her disappointment to so depress her spirits and make her so strangely and
      profoundly miserable; but feeling ashamed of herself didn't improve the
      matter any; it only seemed to aggravate the suffering. She explained that
      she was not feeling very well, and everybody could see that this was true;
      so she got sincere sympathy and commiseration; but that didn't help the
      case. Nothing helps that kind of a case. It is best to just stand off and
      let it fester. The moment the dinner was over the girl excused herself,
      and she hurried home feeling unspeakably grateful to get away from that
      house and that intolerable captivity and suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will he be gone? The thought arose in her brain, but took effect in her
      heels. She slipped into the house, threw off her things and made straight
      for the dining room. She stopped and listened. Her father's voice&mdash;with
      no life in it; presently her mother's&mdash;no life in that; a
      considerable vacancy, then a sterile remark from Washington Hawkins.
      Another silence; then, not Tracy's but her father's voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's gone," she said to herself despairingly, and listlessly opened the
      door and stepped within.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my child," cried the mother, "how white you are! Are you&mdash;has
      anything&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "White?" exclaimed Sellers. "It's gone like a flash; 'twasn't serious.
      Already she's as red as the soul of a watermelon! Sit down, dear, sit down&mdash;goodness
      knows you're welcome. Did you have a good time? We've had great times here&mdash;immense.
      Why didn't Miss Belle come? Mr. Tracy is not feeling well, and she'd have
      made him forget it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was content now; and out from her happy eyes there went a light that
      told a secret to another pair of eyes there and got a secret in return. In
      just that infinitely small fraction of a second those two great
      confessions were made, received, and perfectly understood. All anxiety,
      apprehension, uncertainty, vanished out of these young people's hearts and
      left them filled with a great peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sellers had had the most confident faith that with the new reinforcement
      victory would be at this last moment snatched from the jaws of defeat, but
      it was an error. The talk was as stubbornly disjointed as ever. He was
      proud of Gwendolen, and liked to show her off, even against Miss Belle
      Thompson, and here had been a great opportunity, and what had she made of
      it? He felt a good deal put out. It vexed him to think that this
      Englishman, with the traveling Briton's everlasting disposition to
      generalize whole mountain ranges from single sample-grains of sand, would
      jump to the conclusion that American girls were as dumb as himself&mdash;generalizing
      the whole tribe from this single sample and she at her poorest, there
      being nothing at that table to inspire her, give her a start, keep her
      from going to sleep. He made up his mind that for the honor of the country
      he would bring these two together again over the social board before long.
      There would be a different result another time, he judged. He said to
      himself, with a deep sense of injury, "He'll put in his diary&mdash;they
      all keep diaries&mdash;he'll put in his diary that she was miraculously
      uninteresting&mdash;dear, dear, but wasn't she! I never saw the like&mdash;and
      yet looking as beautiful as Satan, too&mdash;and couldn't seem to do
      anything but paw bread crumbs, and pick flowers to pieces, and look
      fidgety. And it isn't any better here in the Hall of Audience. I've had
      enough; I'll haul down my flag&mdash;the others may fight it out if they
      want to."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook hands all around and went off to do some work which he said was
      pressing. The idolaters were the width of the room apart; and apparently
      unconscious of each other's presence. The distance got shortened a little,
      now. Very soon the mother withdrew. The distance narrowed again. Tracy
      stood before a chromo of some Ohio politician which had been retouched and
      chain-mailed for a crusading Rossmore, and Gwendolen was sitting on the
      sofa not far from his elbow artificially absorbed in examining a
      photograph album that hadn't any photographs in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Senator" still lingered. He was sorry for the young people; it had
      been a dull evening for them. In the goodness of his heart he tried to
      make it pleasant for them now; tried to remove the ill impression
      necessarily left by the general defeat; tried to be chatty, even tried to
      be gay. But the responses were sickly, there was no starting any
      enthusiasm; he would give it up and quit&mdash;it was a day specially
      picked out and consecrated to failures.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Gwendolen rose up promptly and smiled a glad smile and said with
      thankfulness and blessing, "Must you go?" it seemed cruel to desert, and
      he sat down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to begin a remark when&mdash;when he didn't. We have all been
      there. He didn't know how he knew his concluding to stay longer had been a
      mistake, he merely knew it; and knew it for dead certain, too. And so he
      bade goodnight, and went mooning out, wondering what he could have done
      that changed the atmosphere that way. As the door closed behind him those
      two were standing side by side, looking at that door&mdash;looking at it
      in a waiting, second-counting, but deeply grateful kind of way. And the
      instant it closed they flung their arms about each other's necks, and
      there, heart to heart and lip to lip&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my God, she's kissing it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody heard this remark, because Hawkins, who bred it, only thought it,
      he didn't utter it. He had turned, the moment he had closed the door, and
      had pushed it open a little, intending to re-enter and ask what
      ill-advised thing he had done or said, and apologize for it. But he didn't
      re-enter; he staggered off stunned, terrified, distressed.

    <p>
      Five minutes later he was sitting in his room, with his head bowed within
      the circle of his arms, on the table&mdash;final attitude of grief and
      despair. His tears were flowing fast, and now and then a sob broke upon
      the stillness. Presently he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew her when she was a little child and used to climb about my knees;
      I love her as I love my own, and now&mdash;oh, poor thing, poor thing, I
      cannot bear it!&mdash;she's gone and lost her heart to this mangy
      materializee! Why didn't we see that that might happen? But how could we?
      Nobody could; nobody could ever have dreamed of such a thing. You couldn't
      expect a person would fall in love with a wax-work. And this one doesn't
      even amount to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on grieving to himself, and now and then giving voice to his
      lamentations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's done, oh, it's done, and there's no help for it, no undoing the
      miserable business. If I had the nerve, I would kill it. But that wouldn't
      do any good. She loves it; she thinks it's genuine and authentic. If she
      lost it she would grieve for it just as she would for a real person. And
      who's to break it to the family! Not I&mdash;I'll die first. Sellers is
      the best human being I ever knew and I wouldn't any more think of&mdash;oh,
      dear, why it'll break his heart when he finds it out. And Polly's too.
      This comes of meddling with such infernal matters! But for this, the
      creature would still be roasting in Sheol where it belongs. How is it that
      these people don't smell the brimstone? Sometimes I can't come into the
      same room with him without nearly suffocating."
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while he broke out again:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there's one thing, sure. The materializing has got to stop right
      where it is. If she's got to marry a spectre, let her marry a decent one
      out of the Middle Ages, like this one&mdash;not a cowboy and a thief such
      as this protoplasmic tadpole's going to turn into if Sellers keeps on
      fussing at it. It costs five thousand dollars cash and shuts down on the
      incorporated company to stop the works at this point, but Sally Sellers's
      happiness is worth more than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard Sellers coming, and got himself to rights. Sellers took a seat,
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I've got to confess I'm a good deal puzzled. It did certainly eat,
      there's no getting around it. Not eat, exactly, either, but it nibbled;
      nibbled in an appetiteless way, but still it nibbled; and that's just a
      marvel. Now the question is, what does it do with those nibblings? That's
      it&mdash;what does it do with them? My idea is that we don't begin to know
      all there is to this stupendous discovery yet. But time will show&mdash;time
      and science&mdash;give us a chance, and don't get impatient."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he couldn't get Hawkins interested; couldn't make him talk to amount
      to anything; couldn't drag him out of his depression. But at last he took
      a turn that arrested Hawkins's attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm coming to like him, Hawkins. He is a person of stupendous character&mdash;absolutely
      gigantic. Under that placid exterior is concealed the most dare-devil
      spirit that was ever put into a man&mdash;he's just a Clive over again.
      Yes, I'm all admiration for him, on account of his character, and liking
      naturally follows admiration, you know. I'm coming to like him immensely.
      Do you know, I haven't the heart to degrade such a character as that down
      to the burglar estate for money or for anything else; and I've come to ask
      if you are willing to let the reward go, and leave this poor fellow&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where he is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;not bring him down to date."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there's my hand; and my heart's in it, too!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll never forget you for this, Hawkins," said the old gentleman in a
      voice which he found it hard to control. "You are making a great sacrifice
      for me, and one which you can ill afford, but I'll never forget your
      generosity, and if I live you shall not suffer for it, be sure of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally Sellers immediately and vividly realized that she was become a new
      being; a being of a far higher and worthier sort than she had been such a
      little while before; an earnest being, in place of a dreamer; and supplied
      with a reason for her presence in the world, where merely a wistful and
      troubled curiosity about it had existed before. So great and so
      comprehensive was the change which had been wrought, that she seemed to
      herself to be a real person who had lately been a shadow; a something
      which had lately been a nothing; a purpose, which had lately been a fancy;
      a finished temple, with the altar-fires lit and the voice of worship
      ascending, where before had been but an architect's confusion of arid
      working plans, unintelligible to the passing eye and prophesying nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lady" Gwendolen! The pleasantness of that sound was all gone; it was an
      offense to her ear now. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "There&mdash;that sham belongs to the past; I will not be called by it any
      more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may call you simply Gwendolen? You will allow me to drop the
      formalities straightway and name you by your dear first name without
      additions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dethroning the pink and replacing it with a rosebud.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There&mdash;that is better. I hate pinks&mdash;some pinks. Indeed yes,
      you are to call me by my first name without additions&mdash;that is,&mdash;well,
      I don't mean without additions entirely, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was as far as she could get. There was a pause; his intellect was
      struggling to comprehend; presently it did manage to catch the idea in
      time to save embarrassment all around, and he said gratefully&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Gwendolen! I may say that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;part of it. But&mdash;don't kiss me when I am talking, it makes
      me forget what I was going to say. You can call me by part of that form,
      but not the last part. Gwendolen is not my name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not your name?" This in a tone of wonder and surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's soul was suddenly invaded by a creepy apprehension, a quite
      definite sense of suspicion and alarm. She put his arms away from her,
      looked him searchingly in the eye, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer me truly, on your honor. You are not seeking to marry me on
      account of my rank?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The shot almost knocked him through the wall, he was so little prepared
      for it. There was something so finely grotesque about the question and its
      parent suspicion, that he stopped to wonder and admire, and thus was he
      saved from laughing. Then, without wasting precious time, he set about the
      task of convincing her that he had been lured by herself alone, and had
      fallen in love with her only, not her title and position; that he loved
      her with all his heart, and could not love her more if she were a duchess,
      or less if she were without home, name or family. She watched his face
      wistfully, eagerly, hopefully, translating his words by its expression;
      and when he had finished there was gladness in her heart&mdash;a
      tumultuous gladness, indeed, though outwardly she was calm, tranquil, even
      judicially austere. She prepared a surprise for him, now, calculated to
      put a heavy strain upon those disinterested protestations of his; and thus
      she delivered it, burning it away word by word as the fuse burns down to a
      bombshell, and watching to see how far the explosion would lift him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen&mdash;and do not doubt me, for I shall speak the exact truth.
      Howard Tracy, I am no more an earl's child than you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      To her joy&mdash;and secret surprise, also&mdash;it never phased him. He
      was ready, this time, and saw his chance. He cried out with enthusiasm,
      "Thank heaven for that!" and gathered her to his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      To express her happiness was almost beyond her gift of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make me the proudest girl in all the earth," she said, with her head
      pillowed on his shoulder. "I thought it only natural that you should be
      dazzled by the title&mdash;maybe even unconsciously, you being English&mdash;and
      that you might be deceiving yourself in thinking you loved only me, and
      find you didn't love me when the deception was swept away; so it makes me
      proud that the revelation stands for nothing and that you do love just me,
      only me&mdash;oh, prouder than any words can tell!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is only you, sweetheart, I never gave one envying glance toward your
      father's earldom. That is utterly true, dear Gwendolen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There&mdash;you mustn't call me that. I hate that false name. I told you
      it wasn't mine. My name is Sally Sellers&mdash;or Sarah, if you like. From
      this time I banish dreams, visions, imaginings, and will no more of them.
      I am going to be myself&mdash;my genuine self, my honest self, my natural
      self, clear and clean of sham and folly and fraud, and worthy of you.
      There is no grain of social inequality between us; I, like you, am poor;
      I, like you, am without position or distinction; you are a struggling
      artist, I am that, too, in my humbler way. Our bread is honest bread, we
      work for our living. Hand in hand we will walk hence to the grave, helping
      each other in all ways, living for each other, being and remaining one in
      heart and purpose, one in hope and aspiration, inseparable to the end. And
      though our place is low, judged by the world's eye, we will make it as
      high as the highest in the great essentials of honest work for what we eat
      and wear, and conduct above reproach. We live in a land, let us be
      thankful, where this is all-sufficient, and no man is better than his
      neighbor by the grace of God, but only by his own merit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy tried to break in, but she stopped him and kept the floor herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not through yet. I am going to purge myself of the last vestiges of
      artificiality and pretence, and then start fair on your own honest level
      and be worthy mate to you thenceforth. My father honestly thinks he is an
      earl. Well, leave him his dream, it pleases him and does no one any harm:
      It was the dream of his ancestors before him. It has made fools of the
      house of Sellers for generations, and it made something of a fool of me,
      but took no deep root. I am done with it now, and for good. Forty-eight
      hours ago I was privately proud of being the daughter of a pinchbeck earl,
      and thought the proper mate for me must be a man of like degree; but
      to-day&mdash;oh, how grateful I am for your love which has healed my sick
      brain and restored my sanity!&mdash;I could make oath that no earl's son
      in all the world&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh,&mdash;well, but&mdash;but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you look like a person in a panic. What is it? What is the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Matter? Oh, nothing&mdash;nothing. I was only going to say"&mdash;but in
      his flurry nothing occurred to him to say, for a moment; then by a lucky
      inspiration he thought of something entirely sufficient for the occasion,
      and brought it out with eloquent force: "Oh, how beautiful you are! You
      take my breath away when you look like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was well conceived, well timed, and cordially delivered&mdash;and it
      got its reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me see. Where was I? Yes, my father's earldom is pure moonshine. Look
      at those dreadful things on the wall. You have of course supposed them to
      be portraits of his ancestors, earls of Rossmore. Well, they are not. They
      are chromos of distinguished Americans&mdash;all moderns; but he has
      carried them back a thousand years by re-labeling them. Andrew Jackson
      there, is doing what he can to be the late American earl; and the newest
      treasure in the collection is supposed to be the young English heir&mdash;I
      mean the idiot with the crape; but in truth it's a shoemaker, and not Lord
      Berkeley at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why of course I am. He wouldn't look like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because his conduct in his last moments, when the fire was sweeping
      around him shows that he was a man. It shows that he was a fine,
      high-souled young creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy was strongly moved by these compliments, and it seemed to him that
      the girl's lovely lips took on a new loveliness when they were delivering
      them. He said, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a pity he could not know what a gracious impression his behavior
      was going to leave with the dearest and sweetest stranger in the land of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I almost loved him! Why, I think of him every day. He is always
      floating about in my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy felt that this was a little more than was necessary. He was
      conscious of the sting of jealousy. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite right to think of him&mdash;at least now and then&mdash;that
      is, at intervals&mdash;in perhaps an admiring way&mdash;but it seems to me
      that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Howard Tracy, are you jealous of that dead man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was ashamed&mdash;and at the same time not ashamed. He was jealous&mdash;and
      at the same time he was not jealous. In a sense the dead man was himself;
      in that case compliments and affection lavished upon that corpse went into
      his own till and were clear profit. But in another sense the dead man was
      not himself; and in that case all compliments and affection lavished there
      were wasted, and a sufficient basis for jealousy. A tiff was the result of
      the dispute between the two. Then they made it up, and were more loving
      than ever. As an affectionate clincher of the reconciliation, Sally
      declared that she had now banished Lord Berkeley from her mind; and added,
      "And in order to make sure that he shall never make trouble between us
      again, I will teach myself to detest that name and all that have ever
      borne it or ever shall bear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This inflicted another pang, and Tracy was minded to ask her to modify
      that a little just on general principles, and as practice in not overdoing
      a good thing&mdash;perhaps he might better leave things as they were and
      not risk bringing on another tiff. He got away from that particular, and
      sought less tender ground for conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you disapprove wholly of aristocracies and nobilities, now that
      you have renounced your title and your father's earldom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Real ones? Oh, dear no&mdash;but I've thrown aside our sham one for
      good."
    </p>
    <p>
      This answer fell just at the right time and just in the right place, to
      save the poor unstable young man from changing his political complexion
      once more. He had been on the point of beginning to totter again, but this
      prop shored him up and kept him from floundering back into democracy and
      re-renouncing aristocracy. So he went home glad that he had asked the
      fortunate question. The girl would accept a little thing like a genuine
      earldom, she was merely prejudiced against the brummagem article. Yes, he
      could have his girl and have his earldom, too: that question was a
      fortunate stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally went to bed happy, too; and remained happy, deliriously happy, for
      nearly two hours; but at last, just as she was sinking into a contented
      and luxurious unconsciousness, the shady devil who lives and lurks and
      hides and watches inside of human beings and is always waiting for a
      chance to do the proprietor a malicious damage, whispered to her soul and
      said, "That question had a harmless look, but what was back of it?&mdash;what
      was the secret motive of it?&mdash;what suggested it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The shady devil had knifed her, and could retire, now, and take a rest;
      the wound would attend to business for him. And it did.

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should Howard Tracy ask that question? If he was not trying to marry
      her for the sake of her rank, what should suggest that question to him?
      Didn't he plainly look gratified when she said her objections to
      aristocracy had their limitations? Ah, he is after that earldom, that
      gilded sham&mdash;it isn't poor me he wants.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she argued, in anguish and tears. Then she argued the opposite theory,
      but made a weak, poor business of it, and lost the case. She kept the
      arguing up, one side and then the other, the rest of the night, and at
      last fell asleep at dawn; fell in the fire at dawn, one may say; for that
      kind of sleep resembles fire, and one comes out of it with his brain baked
      and his physical forces fried out of him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy wrote his father before he sought his bed. He wrote a letter which
      he believed would get better treatment than his cablegram received, for it
      contained what ought to be welcome news; namely, that he had tried
      equality and working for a living; had made a fight which he could find no
      reason to be ashamed of, and in the matter of earning a living had proved
      that he was able to do it; but that on the whole he had arrived at the
      conclusion that he could not reform the world single-handed, and was
      willing to retire from the conflict with the fair degree of honor which he
      had gained, and was also willing to return home and resume his position
      and be content with it and thankful for it for the future, leaving further
      experiment of a missionary sort to other young people needing the
      chastening and quelling persuasions of experience, the only logic sure to
      convince a diseased imagination and restore it to rugged health. Then he
      approached the subject of marriage with the daughter of the American
      Claimant with a good deal of caution and much painstaking art. He said
      praiseful and appreciative things about the girl, but didn't dwell upon
      that detail or make it prominent. The thing which he made prominent was
      the opportunity now so happily afforded, to reconcile York and Lancaster,
      graft the warring roses upon one stem, and end forever a crying injustice
      which had already lasted far too long. One could infer that he had thought
      this thing all out and chosen this way of making all things fair and right
      because it was sufficiently fair and considerably wiser than the
      renunciation-scheme which he had brought with him from England. One could
      infer that, but he didn't say it. In fact the more he read his letter
      over, the more he got to inferring it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the old earl received that letter, the first part of it filled him
      with a grim and snarly satisfaction; but the rest of it brought a snort or
      two out of him that could be translated differently. He wasted no ink in
      this emergency, either in cablegrams or letters; he promptly took ship for
      America to look into the matter himself. He had staunchly held his grip
      all this long time, and given no sign of the hunger at his heart to see
      his son; hoping for the cure of his insane dream, and resolute that the
      process should go through all the necessary stages without assuaging
      telegrams or other nonsense from home, and here was victory at last.
      Victory, but stupidly marred by this idiotic marriage project. Yes, he
      would step over and take a hand in this matter himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first ten days following the mailing of the letter Tracy's
      spirits had no idle time; they were always climbing up into the clouds or
      sliding down into the earth as deep as the law of gravitation reached. He
      was intensely happy or intensely miserable by turns, according to Miss
      Sally's moods. He never could tell when the mood was going to change, and
      when it changed he couldn't tell what it was that had changed it.
      Sometimes she was so in love with him that her love was tropical, torrid,
      and she could find no language fervent enough for its expression; then
      suddenly, and without warning or any apparent reason, the weather would
      change, and the victim would find himself adrift among the icebergs and
      feeling as lonesome and friendless as the north pole. It sometimes seemed
      to him that a man might better be dead than exposed to these devastating
      varieties of climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case was simple. Sally wanted to believe that Tracy's preference was
      disinterested; so she was always applying little tests of one sort or
      another, hoping and expecting that they would bring out evidence which
      would confirm or fortify her belief. Poor Tracy did not know that these
      experiments were being made upon him, consequently he walked promptly into
      all the traps the girl set for him. These traps consisted in apparently
      casual references to social distinction, aristocratic title and privilege,
      and such things. Often Tracy responded to these references heedlessly and
      not much caring what he said provided it kept the talk going and prolonged
      the seance. He didn't suspect that the girl was watching his face and
      listening for his words as one who watches the judge's face and listens
      for the words which will restore him to home and friends and freedom or
      shut him away from the sun and human companionship forever. He didn't
      suspect that his careless words were being weighed, and so he often
      delivered sentence of death when it would have been just as handy and all
      the same to him to pronounce acquittal. Daily he broke the girl's heart,
      nightly he sent her to the rack for sleep. He couldn't understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people would have put this and that together and perceived that the
      weather never changed until one particular subject was introduced, and
      that then it always changed. And they would have looked further, and
      perceived that that subject was always introduced by the one party, never
      the other. They would have argued, then, that this was done for a purpose.
      If they could not find out what that purpose was in any simpler or easier
      way, they would ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tracy was not deep enough or suspicious enough to think of these
      things. He noticed only one particular; that the weather was always sunny
      when a visit began. No matter how much it might cloud up later, it always
      began with a clear sky. He couldn't explain this curious fact to himself,
      he merely knew it to be a fact. The truth of the matter was, that by the
      time Tracy had been out of Sally's sight six hours she was so famishing
      for a sight of him that her doubts and suspicions were all consumed away
      in the fire of that longing, and so always she came into his presence as
      surprisingly radiant and joyous as she wasn't when she went out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In circumstances like these a growing portrait runs a good many risks. The
      portrait of Sellers, by Tracy, was fighting along, day by day, through
      this mixed weather, and daily adding to itself ineradicable signs of the
      checkered life it was leading. It was the happiest portrait, in spots,
      that was ever seen; but in other spots a damned soul looked out from it; a
      soul that was suffering all the different kinds of distress there are,
      from stomach ache to rabies. But Sellers liked it. He said it was just
      himself all over&mdash;a portrait that sweated moods from every pore, and
      no two moods alike. He said he had as many different kinds of emotions in
      him as a jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a kind of a deadly work of art, maybe, but it was a starchy picture
      for show; for it was life size, full length, and represented the American
      earl in a peer's scarlet robe, with the three ermine bars indicative of an
      earl's rank, and on the gray head an earl's coronet, tilted just a wee bit
      to one side in a most gallus and winsome way. When Sally's weather was
      sunny the portrait made Tracy chuckle, but when her weather was overcast
      it disordered his mind and stopped the circulation of his blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late one night when the sweethearts had been having a flawless visit
      together, Sally's interior devil began to work his specialty, and soon the
      conversation was drifting toward the customary rock. Presently, in the
      midst of Tracy's serene flow of talk, he felt a shudder which he knew was
      not his shudder, but exterior to his breast although immediately against
      it. After the shudder came sobs; Sally was crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my darling, what have I done&mdash;what have I said? It has happened
      again! What have I done to wound you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She disengaged herself from his arms and gave him a look of deep reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you done? I will tell you what you have done. You have
      unwittingly revealed&mdash;oh, for the twentieth time, though I could not
      believe it, would not believe it!&mdash;that it is not me you love, but
      that foolish sham, my father's imitation earldom; and you have broken my
      heart!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my child, what are you saying! I never dreamed of such a thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Howard, Howard, the things you have uttered when you were forgetting
      to guard your tongue, have betrayed you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Things I have uttered when I was forgetting to guard my tongue? These are
      hard words. When have I remembered to guard it? Never in one instance. It
      has no office but to speak the truth. It needs no guarding for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Howard, I have noted your words and weighed them, when you were not
      thinking of their significance&mdash;and they have told me more than you
      meant they should."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say you have answered the trust I had in you by using it
      as an ambuscade from which you could set snares for my unsuspecting tongue
      and be safe from detection while you did it? You have not done this&mdash;surely
      you have not done this thing. Oh, one's enemy could not do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an aspect of the girl's conduct which she had not clearly
      perceived before. Was it treachery? Had she abused a trust? The thought
      crimsoned her cheeks with shame and remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, forgive me," she said, "I did not know what I was doing. I have been
      so tortured&mdash;you will forgive me, you must; I have suffered so much,
      and I am so sorry and so humble; you do forgive me, don't you?&mdash;don't
      turn away, don't refuse me; it is only my love that is at fault, and you
      know I love you, love you with all my heart; I couldn't bear to&mdash;oh,
      dear, dear, I am so miserable, and I sever meant any harm, and I didn't
      see where this insanity was carrying me, and how it was wronging and
      abusing the dearest heart in all the world to me&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
      take me in your arms again, I have no other refuge, no other home and
      hope!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was reconciliation again&mdash;immediate, perfect, all-embracing&mdash;and
      with it utter happiness. This would have been a good time to adjourn. But
      no, now that the cloud-breeder was revealed at last; now that it was
      manifest that all the sour weather had come from this girl's dread that
      Tracy was lured by her rank and not herself, he resolved to lay that ghost
      immediately and permanently by furnishing the best possible proof that he
      couldn't have had back of him at any time the suspected motive. So he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me whisper a little secret in your ear&mdash;a secret which I have
      kept shut up in my breast all this time. Your rank couldn't ever have been
      an enticement. I am son and heir to an English earl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stared at him&mdash;one, two, three moments, maybe a dozen&mdash;then
      her lips parted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You?" she said, and moved away from him, still gazing at him in a kind of
      blank amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&mdash;why, certainly I am. Why do you act like this? What have I done
      now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you done? You have certainly made a most strange statement. You
      must see that yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," with a timid little laugh, "it may be a strange enough statement;
      but of what consequence is that, if it is true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is true. You are already retiring from it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not for a moment! You should not say that. I have not deserved it. I
      have spoken the truth; why do you doubt it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her reply was prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply because you didn't speak it earlier!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" It wasn't a groan, exactly, but it was an intelligible enough
      expression of the fact that he saw the point and recognized that there was
      reason in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have seemed to conceal nothing from me that I ought to know
      concerning yourself, and you were not privileged to keep back such a thing
      as this from me a moment after&mdash;after&mdash;well, after you had
      determined to pay your court to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Its true, it's true, I know it! But there were circumstances&mdash;in&mdash;in
      the way&mdash;circumstances which&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She waved the circumstances aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see," he said, pleadingly, "you seemed so bent on our traveling
      the proud path of honest labor and honorable poverty, that I was terrified&mdash;that
      is, I was afraid&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;well, you know how you talked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know how I talked. And I also know that before the talk was
      finished you inquired how I stood as regards aristocracies, and my answer
      was calculated to relieve your fears."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent a while. Then he said, in a discouraged way:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't see any way out of it. It was a mistake. That is in truth all it
      was, just a mistake. No harm was meant, no harm in the world. I didn't see
      how it might some time look. It is my way. I don't seem to see far."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was almost disarmed, for a moment. Then she flared up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An Earl's son! Do earls' sons go about working in lowly callings for
      their bread and butter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows they don't! I have wished they did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do earls' sons sink their degree in a country like this, and come sober
      and decent to sue for the hand of a born child of poverty when they can go
      drunk, profane, and steeped in dishonorable debt and buy the pick and
      choice of the millionaires' daughters of America? You an earl's son! Show
      me the signs."
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /> <a name="p243" id="p243"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img alt="p243.jpg (29K)" src="images/p243.jpg" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank God I am not able&mdash;if those are the signs. But yet I am an
      earl's son and heir. It is all I can say. I wish you would believe me, but
      you will not. I know no way to persuade you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was about to soften again, but his closing remark made her bring her
      foot down with smart vexation, and she cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you drive all patience out of me! Would you have one believe that you
      haven't your proofs at hand, and yet are what you say you are? You do not
      put your hand in your pocket now&mdash;for you have nothing there. You
      make a claim like this, and then venture to travel without credentials.
      These are simply incredibilities. Don't you see that, yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast about in his mind for a defence of some kind or other&mdash;hesitated
      a little, and then said, with difficulty and diffidence:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you just the truth, foolish as it will seem to you&mdash;to
      anybody, I suppose&mdash;but it is the truth. I had an ideal&mdash;call it
      a dream, a folly, if you will&mdash;but I wanted to renounce the
      privileges and unfair advantages enjoyed by the nobility and wrung from
      the nation by force and fraud, and purge myself of my share of those
      crimes against right and reason, by thenceforth comrading with the poor
      and humble on equal terms, earning with my own hands the bread I ate, and
      rising by my own merit if I rose at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl scanned his face narrowly while he spoke; and there was
      something about his simplicity of manner and statement which touched her
      &mdash;touched her almost to the danger point; but she set her grip on the
      yielding spirit and choked it to quiescence; it could not be wise to
      surrender to compassion or any kind of sentiment, yet; she must ask one or
      two more questions. Tracy was reading her face; and what he read there
      lifted his drooping hopes a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An earl's son to do that! Why, he were a man! A man to love!&mdash;oh,
      more, a man to worship!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I&mdash;?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he never lived! He is not born, he will not be born. The
      self-abnegation that could do that&mdash;even in utter folly, and hopeless
      of conveying benefit to any, beyond the mere example&mdash;could be
      mistaken for greatness; why, it would be greatness in this cold age of
      sordid ideals! A moment&mdash;wait&mdash;let me finish; I have one
      question more. Your father is earl of what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rossmore&mdash;and I am Viscount Berkeley!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The fat was in the fire again. The girl felt so outraged that it was
      difficult for her to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you venture such a brazen thing! You know that he is dead, and
      you know that I know it. Oh, to rob the living of name and honors for a
      selfish and temporary advantage is crime enough, but to rob the
      defenceless dead&mdash;why it is more than crime, it degrades crime!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, listen to me&mdash;just a word&mdash;don't turn away like that. Don't
      go&mdash;don't leave me, so&mdash;stay one moment. On my honor&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, on your honor!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my honor I am what I say! And I will prove it, and you will believe, I
      know you will. I will bring you a message&mdash;a cablegram&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow&mdash;next day&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Signed 'Rossmore'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;signed Rossmore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will that prove?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will it prove? What should it prove?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you force me to say it&mdash;possibly the presence of a confederate
      somewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a hard blow, and staggered him. He said, dejectedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true. I did not think of it. Oh, my God, I do not know any way to
      do; I do everything wrong. You are going?&mdash;and you won't say even
      good-night&mdash;or good-bye? Ah, we have not parted like this before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I want to run and&mdash;no, go, now." A pause&mdash;then she said,
      "You may bring the message when it comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, may I? God bless you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gone; and none too soon; her lips were already quivering, and now
      she broke down. Through her sobbings her words broke from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he is gone. I have lost him, I shall never see him any more. And he
      didn't kiss me good-bye; never even offered to force a kiss from me, and
      he knowing it was the very, very last, and I expecting he would, and never
      dreaming he would treat me so after all we have been to each other. Oh,
      oh, oh, oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! He is a dear, poor,
      miserable, good-hearted, transparent liar and humbug, but oh, I do love
      him so&mdash;!" After a little she broke into speech again. "How dear he
      is! and I shall miss him so, I shall miss him so! Why won't he ever think
      to forge a message and fetch it?&mdash;but no, he never will, he never
      thinks of anything; he's so honest and simple it wouldn't ever occur to
      him. Oh, what did possess him to think he could succeed as a fraud&mdash;and
      he hasn't the first requisite except duplicity that I can see. Oh, dear,
      I'll go to bed and give it all up. Oh, I wish I had told him to come and
      tell me whenever he didn't get any telegram&mdash;and now it's all my own
      fault if I never see him again. How my eyes must look!"
    </p>

      CHAPTER XXIV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, sure enough, the cablegram didn't come. This was an immense
      disaster; for Tracy couldn't go into the presence without that ticket,
      although it wasn't going to possess any value as evidence. But if the
      failure of the cablegram on that first day may be called an immense
      disaster, where is the dictionary that can turn out a phrase sizeable
      enough to describe the tenth day's failure? Of course every day that the
      cablegram didn't come made Tracy all of twenty-four hours' more ashamed of
      himself than he was the day before, and made Sally fully twenty-four hours
      more certain than ever that he not only hadn't any father anywhere, but
      hadn't even a confederate&mdash;and so it followed that he was a
      double-dyed humbug and couldn't be otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were hard days for Barrow and the art firm. All these had their
      hands full, trying to comfort Tracy. Barrow's task was particularly hard,
      because he was made a confidant in full, and therefore had to humor
      Tracy's delusion that he had a father, and that the father was an earl,
      and that he was going to send a cablegram. Barrow early gave up the idea
      of trying to convince Tracy that he hadn't any father, because this had
      such a bad effect on the patient, and worked up his temper to such an
      alarming degree. He had tried, as an experiment, letting Tracy think he
      had a father; the result was so good that he went further, with proper
      caution, and tried letting him think his father was an earl; this wrought
      so well, that he grew bold, and tried letting him think he had two
      fathers, if he wanted to, but he didn't want to, so Barrow withdrew one of
      them and substituted letting him think he was going to get a cablegram&mdash;which
      Barrow judged he wouldn't, and was right; but Barrow worked the cablegram
      daily for all it was worth, and it was the one thing that kept Tracy
      alive; that was Barrow's opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And these were bitter hard days for poor Sally, and mainly delivered up to
      private crying. She kept her furniture pretty damp, and so caught cold,
      and the dampness and the cold and the sorrow together undermined her
      appetite, and she was a pitiful enough object, poor thing. Her state was
      bad enough, as per statement of it above quoted; but all the forces of
      nature and circumstance seemed conspiring to make it worse&mdash;and
      succeeding. For instance, the morning after her dismissal of Tracy,
      Hawkins and Sellers read in the associated press dispatches that a toy
      puzzle called Pigs in the Clover, had come into sudden favor within the
      past few weeks, and that from the Atlantic to the Pacific all the
      populations of all the States had knocked off work to play with it, and
      that the business of the country had now come to a standstill by
      consequence; that judges, lawyers, burglars, parsons, thieves, merchants,
      mechanics, murderers, women, children, babies&mdash;everybody, indeed,
      could be seen from morning till midnight, absorbed in one deep project and
      purpose, and only one&mdash;to pen those pigs, work out that puzzle
      successfully; that all gayety, all cheerfulness had departed from the
      nation, and in its place care, preoccupation and anxiety sat upon every
      countenance, and all faces were drawn, distressed, and furrowed with the
      signs of age and trouble, and marked with the still sadder signs of mental
      decay and incipient madness; that factories were at work night and day in
      eight cities, and yet to supply the demand for the puzzle was thus far
      impossible. Hawkins was wild with joy, but Sellers was calm. Small matters
      could not disturb his serenity. He said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just the way things go. A man invents a thing which could
      revolutionize the arts, produce mountains of money, and bless the earth,
      and who will bother with it or show any interest in it?&mdash;and so you
      are just as poor as you were before. But you invent some worthless thing
      to amuse yourself with, and would throw it away if let alone, and all of a
      sudden the whole world makes a snatch for it and out crops a fortune. Hunt
      up that Yankee and collect, Hawkins&mdash;half is yours, you know. Leave
      me to potter at my lecture."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a temperance lecture. Sellers was head chief in the Temperance
      camp, and had lectured, now and then in that interest, but had been
      dissatisfied with his efforts; wherefore he was now about to try a new
      plan. After much thought he had concluded that a main reason why his
      lectures lacked fire or something, was that they were too transparently
      amateurish; that is to say, it was probably too plainly perceptible that
      the lecturer was trying to tell people about the horrid effects of liquor
      when he didn't really know anything about those effects except from
      hearsay, since he had hardly ever tasted an intoxicant in his life. His
      scheme, now, was to prepare himself to speak from bitter experience.
      Hawkins was to stand by with the bottle, calculate the doses, watch the
      effects, make notes of results, and otherwise assist in the preparation.
      Time was short, for the ladies would be along about noon&mdash;that is to
      say, the temperance organization called the Daughters of Siloam&mdash;and
      Sellers must be ready to head the procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time kept slipping along&mdash;Hawkins did not return&mdash;Sellers
      could not venture to wait longer; so he attacked the bottle himself, and
      proceeded to note the effects. Hawkins got back at last; took one
      comprehensive glance at the lecturer, and went down and headed off the
      procession. The ladies were grieved to hear that the champion had been
      taken suddenly ill and violently so, but glad to hear that it was hoped he
      would be out again in a few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it turned out, the old gentleman didn't turn over or show any signs of
      life worth speaking of for twenty-four hours. Then he asked after the
      procession, and learned what had happened about it. He was sorry; said he
      had been "fixed" for it. He remained abed several days, and his wife and
      daughter took turns in sitting with him and ministering to his wants.
      Often he patted Sally's head and tried to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't cry, my child, don't cry so; you know your old father did it by
      mistake and didn't mean a bit of harm; you know he wouldn't intentionally
      do anything to make you ashamed for the world; you know he was trying to
      do good and only made the mistake through ignorance, not knowing the right
      doses and Washington not there to help. Don't cry so, dear, it breaks my
      old heart to see you, and think I've brought this humiliation on you and
      you so dear to me and so good. I won't ever do it again, indeed I won't;
      now be comforted, honey, that's a good child."
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she wasn't on duty at the bedside the crying went on just the
      same; then the mother would try to comfort her, and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't cry, dear, he never meant any harm; it was all one of those happens
      that you can't guard against when you are trying experiments, that way.
      You see I don't cry. It's because I know him so well. I could never look
      anybody in the face again if he had got into such an amazing condition as
      that a-purpose; but bless you his intention was pure and high, and that
      makes the act pure, though it was higher than was necessary. We're not
      humiliated, dear, he did it under a noble impulse and we don't need to be
      ashamed. There, don't cry any more, honey."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the old gentleman was useful to Sally, during several days, as an
      explanation of her tearfulness. She felt thankful to him for the shelter
      he was affording her, but often said to herself, "It's a shame to let him
      see in my crying a reproach&mdash;as if he could ever do anything that
      could make me reproach him! But I can't confess; I've got to go on using
      him for a pretext, he's the only one I've got in the world, and I do need
      one so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Sellers was out again, and found that stacks of money had been
      placed in bank for him and Hawkins by the Yankee, he said, "Now we'll soon
      see who's the Claimant and who's the Authentic. I'll just go over there
      and warm up that House of Lords." During the next few days he and his wife
      were so busy with preparations for the voyage that Sally had all the
      privacy she needed, and all the chance to cry that was good for her. Then
      the old pair left for New York&mdash;and England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally had also had a chance to do another thing. That was, to make up her
      mind that life was not worth living upon the present terms. If she must
      give up her impostor and die, doubtless she must submit; but might she not
      lay her whole case before some disinterested person, first, and see if
      there wasn't perhaps some saving way out of the matter? She turned this
      idea over in her mind a good deal. In her first visit with Hawkins after
      her parents were gone, the talk fell upon Tracy, and she was impelled to
      set her case before the statesman and take his counsel. So she poured out
      her heart, and he listened with painful solicitude. She concluded,
      pleadingly, with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't tell me he is an impostor. I suppose he is, but doesn't it look to
      you as if he isn't? You are cool, you know, and outside; and so, maybe it
      can look to you as if he isn't one, when it can't to me. Doesn't it look
      to you as if he isn't? Couldn't you&mdash;can't it look to you that way&mdash;for&mdash;for
      my sake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor man was troubled, but he felt obliged to keep in the neighborhood
      of the truth. He fought around the present detail a little while, then
      gave it up and said he couldn't really see his way to clearing Tracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said, "the truth is, he's an impostor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is, you&mdash;you feel a little certain, but not entirely&mdash;oh,
      not entirely, Mr. Hawkins!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a pity to have to say it&mdash;I do hate to say it, but I don't
      think anything about it, I know he's an impostor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, now, Mr. Hawkins, you can't go that far. A body can't really know it,
      you know. It isn't proved that he's not what he says he is."
    </p>
    <p>
      Should he come out and make a clean breast of the whole wretched business?
      Yes&mdash;at least the most of it&mdash;it ought to be done. So he set his
      teeth and went at the matter with determination, but purposing to spare
      the girl one pain&mdash;that of knowing that Tracy was a criminal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I am going to tell you a plain tale; one not pleasant for me to tell
      or for you to hear, but we've got to stand it. I know all about that
      fellow; and I know he is no earl's son."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's eyes flashed, and she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care a snap for that&mdash;go on!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was so wholly unexpected that it at once obstructed the narrative;
      Hawkins was not even sure that he had heard aright. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that I quite understand. Do you mean to say that if he was
      all right and proper otherwise you'd be indifferent about the earl part of
      the business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd be entirely satisfied with him and wouldn't care for his not being
      an earl's son,&mdash;that being an earl's son wouldn't add any value to
      him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the least value that I would care for. Why, Mr. Hawkins, I've gotten
      over all that day-dreaming about earldoms and aristocracies and all such
      nonsense and am become just a plain ordinary nobody and content with it;
      and it is to him I owe my cure. And as to anything being able to add a
      value to him, nothing can do that. He is the whole world to me, just as he
      is; he comprehends all the values there are&mdash;then how can you add
      one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's pretty far gone." He said that to himself. He continued, still to
      himself, "I must change my plan again; I can't seem to strike one that
      will stand the requirements of this most variegated emergency five minutes
      on a stretch. Without making this fellow a criminal, I believe I will
      invent a name and a character for him calculated to disenchant her. If it
      fails to do it, then I'll know that the next rightest thing to do will be
      to help her to her fate, poor thing, not hinder her." Then he said aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Gwendolen&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to be called Sally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad of it; I like it better, myself. Well, then, I'll tell you about
      this man Snodgrass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Snodgrass! Is that his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;Snodgrass. The other's his nom de plume."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's hideous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it is, but we can't help our names."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is truly his real name&mdash;and not Howard Tracy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins answered, regretfully:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it seems a pity."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl sampled the name musingly, once or twice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Snodgrass. Snodgrass. No, I could not endure that. I could not get used
      to it. No, I should call him by his first name. What is his first name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His&mdash;er&mdash;his initials are S. M."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His initials? I don't care anything about his initials. I can't call him
      by his initials. What do they stand for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see, his father was a physician, and he&mdash;he&mdash;well he
      was an idolater of his profession, and he&mdash;well, he was a very
      eccentric man, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do they stand for! What are you shuffling about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They&mdash;well they stand for Spinal Meningitis. His father being a phy&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard such an infamous name! Nobody can ever call a person that&mdash;a
      person they love. I wouldn't call an enemy by such a name. It sounds like
      an epithet." After a moment, she added with a kind of consternation, "Why,
      it would be my name! Letters would come with it on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;Mrs. Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't repeat it&mdash;don't; I can't bear it. Was the father a lunatic?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, that is not charged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad of that, because that is transmissible. What do you think was
      the matter with him, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I don't really know. The family used to run a good deal to idiots,
      and so, maybe&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there isn't any maybe about it. This one was an idiot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes&mdash;he could have been. He was suspected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suspected!" said Sally, with irritation. "Would one suspect there was
      going to be a dark time if he saw the constellations fall out of the sky?
      But that is enough about the idiot, I don't take any interest in idiots;
      tell me about the son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then, this one was the eldest, but not the favorite. His
      brother, Zylobalsamum&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait&mdash;give me a chance to realize that. It is perfectly stupefying.
      Zylo&mdash;what did you call it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Zylobalsamum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never heard such a name: It sounds like a disease. Is it a disease?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't think it's a disease. It's either Scriptural or&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's not Scriptural."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it's anatomical. I knew it was one or the other. Yes, I remember,
      now, it is anatomical. It's a ganglion&mdash;a nerve centre&mdash;it is
      what is called the zylobalsamum process."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go on; and if you come to any more of them, omit the names; they
      make one feel so uncomfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then. As I said, this one was not a favorite in the family,
      and so he was neglected in every way, never sent to school, always allowed
      to associate with the worst and coarsest characters, and so of course he
      has grown up a rude, vulgar, ignorant, dissipated ruffian, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He? It's no such thing! You ought to be more generous than to make such a
      statement as that about a poor young stranger who&mdash;who&mdash;why, he
      is the very opposite of that! He is considerate, courteous, obliging,
      modest, gentle, refined, cultivated-oh, for shame! how can you say such
      things about him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't blame you, Sally&mdash;indeed I haven't a word of blame for you
      for being blinded by&mdash;your affection&mdash;blinded to these minor
      defects which are so manifest to others who&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Minor defects? Do you call these minor defects? What are murder and
      arson, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a difficult question to answer straight off&mdash;and of course
      estimates of such things vary with environment. With us, out our way, they
      would not necessarily attract as much attention as with you, yet they are
      often regarded with disapproval&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Murder and arson are regarded with disapproval?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, frequently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With disapproval. Who are those Puritans you are talking about? But wait&mdash;how
      did you come to know so much about this family? Where did you get all this
      hearsay evidence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sally, it isn't hearsay evidence. That is the serious part of it. I knew
      that family&mdash;personally."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You? You actually knew them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knew Zylo, as we used to call him, and knew his father, Dr. Snodgrass. I
      didn't know your own Snodgrass, but have had glimpses of him from time to
      time, and I heard about him all the time. He was the common talk, you see,
      on account of his&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On account of his not being a house-burner or an assassin, I suppose.
      That would have made him commonplace. Where did you know these people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Cherokee Strip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how preposterous! There are not enough people in Cherokee Strip to
      give anybody a reputation, good or bad. There isn't a quorum. Why the
      whole population consists of a couple of wagon loads of horse thieves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins answered placidly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our friend was one of those wagon loads."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally's eyes burned and her breath came quick and fast, but she kept a
      fairly good grip on her anger and did not let it get the advantage of her
      tongue. The statesman sat still and waited for developments. He was
      content with his work. It was as handsome a piece of diplomatic art as he
      had ever turned out, he thought; and now, let the girl make her own
      choice. He judged she would let her spectre go; he hadn't a doubt of it in
      fact; but anyway, let the choice be made, and he was ready to ratify it
      and offer no further hindrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Sally had thought her case out and made up her mind. To the
      major's disappointment the verdict was against him. Sally said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has no friend but me, and I will not desert him now. I will not marry
      him if his moral character is bad; but if he can prove that it isn't, I
      will&mdash;and he shall have the chance. To me he seems utterly good and
      dear; I've never seen anything about him that looked otherwise&mdash;except,
      of course, his calling himself an earl's son. Maybe that is only vanity,
      and no real harm, when you get to the bottom of it. I do not believe he is
      any such person as you have painted him. I want to see him. I want you to
      find him and send him to me. I will implore him to be honest with me, and
      tell me the whole truth, and not be afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; if that is your decision I will do it. But Sally, you know,
      he's poor, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I don't care anything about that. That's neither here nor there. Will
      you bring him to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll do it. When?&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear, it's getting toward dark, now, and so you'll have to put it off
      till morning. But you will find him in the morning, won't you? Promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have him here by daylight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, now you're your own old self again&mdash;and lovelier than ever!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't ask fairer than that. Good-bye, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sally mused a moment alone, then said earnestly, "I love him in spite of
      his name!" and went about her affairs with a light heart.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins went straight to the telegraph office and disburdened his
      conscience. He said to himself, "She's not going to give this galvanized
      cadaver up, that's plain. Wild horses can't pull her away from him. I've
      done my share; it's for Sellers to take an innings, now." So he sent this
      message to New York:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back. Hire special train. She's going to marry the materializee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime a note came to Rossmore Towers to say that the Earl of Rossmore
      had just arrived from England, and would do himself the pleasure of
      calling in the evening. Sally said to herself, "It is a pity he didn't
      stop in New York; but it's no matter; he can go up to-morrow and see my
      father. He has come over here to tomahawk papa, very likely&mdash;or buy
      out his claim. This thing would have excited me, a while back; but it has
      only one interest for me now, and only one value. I can say to&mdash;to&mdash;Spine,
      Spiny, Spinal&mdash;I don't like any form of that name!&mdash;I can say to
      him to-morrow, 'Don't try to keep it up any more, or I shall have to tell
      you whom I have been talking with last night, and then you will be
      embarrassed.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy couldn't know he was to be invited for the morrow, or he might have
      waited. As it was, he was too miserable to wait any longer; for his last
      hope&mdash;a letter&mdash;had failed him. It was fully due to-day; it had
      not come. Had his father really flung him away? It looked so. It was not
      like his father, but it surely looked so. His father was a rather tough
      nut, in truth, but had never been so with his son&mdash;still, this
      implacable silence had a calamitous look. Anyway, Tracy would go to the
      Towers and &mdash;then what? He didn't know; his head was tired out with
      thinking&mdash;he wouldn't think about what he must do or say&mdash;let it
      all take care of itself. So that he saw Sally once more, he would be
      satisfied, happen what might; he wouldn't care.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hardly knew how he got to the Towers, or when. He knew and cared for
      only one thing&mdash;he was alone with Sally. She was kind, she was
      gentle, there was moisture in her eyes, and a yearning something in her
      face and manner which she could not wholly hide&mdash;but she kept her
      distance. They talked. Bye and bye she said&mdash;watching his downcast
      countenance out of the corner of her eye&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so lonesome&mdash;with papa and mamma gone. I try to read, but I
      can't seem to get interested in any book. I try the newspapers, but they
      do put such rubbish in them. You take up a paper and start to read
      something you thinks interesting, and it goes on and on and on about how
      somebody&mdash;well, Dr. Snodgrass, for instance&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a movement from Tracy, not the quiver of a muscle. Sally was amazed
      &mdash;what command of himself he must have! Being disconcerted, she
      paused so long that Tracy presently looked up wearily and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I thought you were not listening. Yes, it goes on and on about this
      Doctor Snodgrass, till you are so tired, and then about his younger son&mdash;the
      favorite son&mdash;Zylobalsamum Snodgrass&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a sign from Tracy, whose head was drooping again. What supernatural
      self-possession! Sally fixed her eye on him and began again, resolved to
      blast him out of his serenity this time if she knew how to apply the
      dynamite that is concealed in certain forms of words when those words are
      properly loaded with unexpected meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And next it goes on and on and on about the eldest son&mdash;not the
      favorite, this one&mdash;and how he is neglected in his poor barren
      boyhood, and allowed to grow up unschooled, ignorant, coarse, vulgar, the
      comrade of the community's scum, and become in his completed manhood a
      rude, profane, dissipated ruffian&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      That head still drooped! Sally rose, moved softly and solemnly a step or
      two, and stood before Tracy&mdash;his head came slowly up, his meek eyes
      met her intense ones&mdash;then she finished with deep impressiveness&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "&mdash;named Spinal Meningitis Snodgrass!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy merely exhibited signs of increased fatigue. The girl was outraged
      by this iron indifference and callousness, and cried out&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you made of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you any sensitiveness? Don't these things touch any poor remnant
      of delicate feeling in you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "N&mdash;no," he said wonderingly, "they don't seem to. Why should they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, dear me, how can you look so innocent, and foolish, and good, and
      empty, and gentle, and all that, right in the hearing of such things as
      those! Look me in the eye&mdash;straight in the eye. There, now then,
      answer me without a flinch. Isn't Doctor Snodgrass your father, and isn't
      Zylobalsamum your brother," [here Hawkins was about to enter the room, but
      changed his mind upon hearing these words, and elected for a walk down
      town, and so glided swiftly away], "and isn't your name Spinal Meningitis,
      and isn't your father a doctor and an idiot, like all the family for
      generations, and doesn't he name all his children after poisons and
      pestilences and abnormal anatomical eccentricities of the human body?
      Answer me, some way or somehow&mdash;and quick. Why do you sit there
      looking like an envelope without any address on it and see me going mad
      before your face with suspense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I wish I could do&mdash;do&mdash;I wish I could do something,
      anything that would give you peace again and make you happy; but I know of
      nothing&mdash;I know of no way. I have never heard of these awful people
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Say it again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never&mdash;never in my life till now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you do look so honest when you say that! It must be true&mdash;surely
      you couldn't look that way, you wouldn't look that way if it were not true&mdash;would
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't and wouldn't. It is true. Oh, let us end this suffering&mdash;take
      me back into your heart and confidence&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait&mdash;one more thing. Tell me you told that falsehood out of mere
      vanity and are sorry for it; that you're not expecting to ever wear the
      coronet of an earl&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly I am cured&mdash;cured this very day&mdash;I am not expecting it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, now you are mine! I've got you back in the beauty and glory of your
      unsmirched poverty and your honorable obscurity, and nobody shall ever
      take you from me again but the grave! And if&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "De earl of Rossmore, fum Englan'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father!" The young man released the girl and hung his head.

      The old gentleman stood surveying the couple&mdash;the one with a strongly
      complimentary right eye, the other with a mixed expression done with the
      left. This is difficult, and not often resorted to. Presently his face
      relaxed into a kind of constructive gentleness, and he said to his son:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you think you could embrace me, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man did it with alacrity. "Then you are the son of an earl,
      after all," said Sally, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I won't have you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "O, but you know&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I will not. You've told me another fib."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's right. Go away and leave us. I want to talk with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Berkeley was obliged to go. But he did not go far. He remained on the
      premises. At midnight the conference between the old gentleman and the
      young girl was still going blithely on, but it presently drew to a close,
      and the former said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came all the way over here to inspect you, my dear, with the general
      idea of breaking off this match if there were two fools of you, but as
      there's only one, you can have him if you'll take him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I will, then! May I kiss you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may. Thank you. Now you shall have that privilege whenever you are
      good."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Hawkins had long ago returned and slipped up into the laboratory.
      He was rather disconcerted to find his late invention, Snodgrass, there.
      The news was told him that the English Rossmore was come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;"And I'm his son, Viscount Berkeley, not Howard Tracy any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins was aghast. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good gracious, then you're dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes you are&mdash;we've got your ashes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang those ashes, I'm tired of them; I'll give them to my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly and painfully the statesman worked the truth into his head that
      this was really a flesh and blood young man, and not the insubstantial
      resurrection he and Sellers had so long supposed him to be. Then he said
      with feeling&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so glad; so glad on Sally's account, poor thing. We took you for a
      departed materialized bank thief from Tahlequah. This will be a heavy blow
      to Sellers." Then he explained the whole matter to Berkeley, who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the Claimant must manage to stand the blow, severe as it is. But
      he'll get over the disappointment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who&mdash;the colonel? He'll get over it the minute he invents a new
      miracle to take its place. And he's already at it by this time. But look
      here&mdash;what do you suppose became of the man you've been representing
      all this time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. I saved his clothes&mdash;it was all I could do. I am
      afraid he lost his life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you must have found twenty or thirty thousand dollars in those
      clothes, in money or certificates of deposit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I found only five hundred and a trifle. I borrowed the trifle and
      banked the five hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What'll we do about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Return it to the owner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's easy said, but not easy to manage. Let's leave it alone till we get
      Sellers's advice. And that reminds me. I've got to run and meet Sellers
      and explain who you are not and who you are, or he'll come thundering in
      here to stop his daughter from marrying a phantom. But&mdash;suppose your
      father came over here to break off the match?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, isn't he down stairs getting acquainted with Sally? That's all
      safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Hawkins departed to meet and prepare the Sellerses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rossmore Towers saw great times and late hours during the succeeding week.
      The two earls were such opposites in nature that they fraternized at once.
      Sellers said privately that Rossmore was the most extraordinary character
      he had ever met&mdash;a man just made out of the condensed milk of human
      kindness, yet with the ability to totally hide the fact from any but the
      most practised character-reader; a man whose whole being was sweetness,
      patience and charity, yet with a cunning so profound, an ability so
      marvelous in the acting of a double part, that many a person of
      considerable intelligence might live with him for centuries and never
      suspect the presence in him of these characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally there was a quiet wedding at the Towers, instead of a big one at
      the British embassy, with the militia and the fire brigades and the
      temperance organizations on hand in torchlight procession, as at first
      proposed by one of the earls. The art-firm and Barrow were present at the
      wedding, and the tinner and Puss had been invited, but the tinner was ill
      and Puss was nursing him&mdash;for they were engaged.

      The Sellerses were to go to England with their new allies for a brief
      visit, but when it was time to take the train from Washington, the colonel
      was missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins was going as far as New York with the party, and said he would
      explain the matter on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation was in a letter left by the colonel in Hawkins's hands. In
      it he promised to join Mrs. Sellers later, in England, and then went on to
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, my dear Hawkins, a mighty idea has been born to me within
      the hour, and I must not even stop to say goodbye to my dear ones. A man's
      highest duty takes precedence of all minor ones, and must be attended to
      with his best promptness and energy, at whatsoever cost to his affections
      or his convenience. And first of all a man's duties is his duty to his own
      honor&mdash;he must keep that spotless. Mine is threatened. When I was
      feeling sure of my imminent future solidity, I forwarded to the Czar of
      Russia&mdash;perhaps prematurely&mdash;an offer for the purchase of
      Siberia, naming a vast sum. Since then an episode has warned me that the
      method by which I was expecting to acquire this money&mdash;materialization
      upon a scale of limitless magnitude&mdash;is marred by a taint of
      temporary uncertainty. His imperial majesty may accept my offer at any
      moment. If this should occur now, I should find myself painfully
      embarrassed, in fact financially inadequate. I could not take Siberia.
      This would become known, and my credit would suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently my private hours have been dark indeed, but the sun shines again
      now; I see my way; I shall be able to meet my obligation, and without
      having to ask an extension of the stipulated time, I think. This grand new
      idea of mine&mdash;the sublimest I have ever conceived, will save me
      whole, I am sure. I am leaving for San Francisco this moment, to test it,
      by the help of the great Lick telescope. Like all of my more notable
      discoveries and inventions, it is based upon hard, practical scientific
      laws; all other bases are unsound and hence untrustworthy. In brief, then,
      I have conceived the stupendous idea of reorganizing the climates of the
      earth according to the desire of the populations interested. That is to
      say, I will furnish climates to order, for cash or negotiable paper,
      taking the old climates in part payment, of course, at a fair discount,
      where they are in condition to be repaired at small cost and let out for
      hire to poor and remote communities not able to afford a good climate and
      not caring for an expensive one for mere display. My studies have
      convinced me that the regulation of climates and the breeding of new
      varieties at will from the old stock is a feasible thing. Indeed I am
      convinced that it has been done before; done in prehistoric times by now
      forgotten and unrecorded civilizations. Everywhere I find hoary evidences
      of artificial manipulation of climates in bygone times. Take the glacial
      period. Was that produced by accident? Not at all; it was done for money.
      I have a thousand proofs of it, and will some day reveal them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will confide to you an outline of my idea. It is to utilize the spots on
      the sun&mdash;get control of them, you understand, and apply the
      stupendous energies which they wield to beneficent purposes in the
      reorganizing of our climates. At present they merely make trouble and do
      harm in the evoking of cyclones and other kinds of electric storms; but
      once under humane and intelligent control this will cease and they will
      become a boon to man.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have my plan all mapped out, whereby I hope and expect to acquire
      complete and perfect control of the sun-spots, also details of the method
      whereby I shall employ the same commercially; but I will not venture to go
      into particulars before the patents shall have been issued. I shall hope
      and expect to sell shop-rights to the minor countries at a reasonable
      figure and supply a good business article of climate to the great empires
      at special rates, together with fancy brands for coronations, battles and
      other great and particular occasions. There are billions of money in this
      enterprise, no expensive plant is required, and I shall begin to realize
      in a few days&mdash;in a few weeks at furthest. I shall stand ready to pay
      cash for Siberia the moment it is delivered, and thus save my honor and my
      credit. I am confident of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like you to provide a proper outfit and start north as soon as I
      telegraph you, be it night or be it day. I wish you to take up all the
      country stretching away from the north pole on all sides for many degrees
      south, and buy Greenland and Iceland at the best figure you can get now
      while they are cheap. It is my intention to move one of the tropics up
      there and transfer the frigid zone to the equator. I will have the entire
      Arctic Circle in the market as a summer resort next year, and will use the
      surplusage of the old climate, over and above what can be utilized on the
      equator, to reduce the temperature of opposition resorts. But I have said
      enough to give you an idea of the prodigious nature of my scheme and the
      feasible and enormously profitable character of it. I shall join all you
      happy people in England as soon as I shall have sold out some of my
      principal climates and arranged with the Czar about Siberia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, watch for a sign from me. Eight days from now, we shall be wide
      asunder; for I shall be on the border of the Pacific, and you far out on
      the Atlantic, approaching England. That day, if I am alive and my sublime
      discovery is proved and established, I will send you greeting, and my
      messenger shall deliver it where you are, in the solitudes of the sea; for
      I will waft a vast sun-spot across the disk like drifting smoke, and you
      will know it for my love-sign, and will say "Mulberry Sellers throws us a
      kiss across the universe."

      A brief though violent thunderstorm which had raged over the city was
      passing away; but still, though the rain had ceased more than an hour
      before, wild piles of dark and coppery clouds, in which a fierce and
      rayless glow was laboring, gigantically overhung the grotesque and huddled
      vista of dwarf houses, while in the distance, sheeting high over the low,
      misty confusion of gables and chimneys, spread a pall of dead, leprous
      blue, suffused with blotches of dull, glistening yellow, and with black
      plague-spots of vapor floating and faint lightnings crinkling on its
      surface. Thunder, still muttering in the close and sultry air, kept the
      scared dwellers in the street within, behind their closed shutters; and
      all deserted, cowed, dejected, squalid, like poor, stupid, top-heavy
      things that had felt the wrath of the summer tempest, stood the drenched
      structures on either side of the narrow and crooked way, ghastly and
      picturesque, under the giant canopy. Rain dripped wretchedly in slow drops
      of melancholy sound from their projecting eaves upon the broken flagging,
      lay there in pools or trickled into the swollen drains, where the fallen
      torrent sullenly gurgled on its way to the river. "The Brazen Android."-W.

      Merciful heavens! The whole west, from right to left, blazes up with a

      shock of ten thousand batteries of artillery. It is the signal for the
      Fury to spring&mdash;for a thousand demons to scream and shriek&mdash;for
      innumerable serpents of fire to writhe and light up the blackness.

      merge into an awful roar, as did the 800 cannon at Gettysburg. Crash!

      Shriek! It is the Demon racing along the plain and uprooting even the

      Away up the gorge all diurnal fancies trooped into the wide liberties of
      endless luminous vistas of azure sunlit mountains beneath the shining
      azure heavens. The sky, looking down in deep blue placidities, only here
      and there smote the water to azure emulations of its tint.&mdash;<br /> "In

      There was every indication of a dust-storm, though the sun still shone
      brilliantly. The hot wind had become wild and rampant. It was whipping up
      the sandy coating of the plain in every direction. High in the air were
      seen whirling spires and cones of sand&mdash;a curious effect against the
      deep-blue sky. Below, puffs of sand were breaking out of the plain in
      every direction, as though the plain were alive with invisible horsemen.
      These sandy cloudlets were instantly dissipated by the wind; it was the
      larger clouds that were lifted whole into the air, and the larger clouds
      of sand were becoming more and more the rule.

      Alfred's eye, quickly scanning the horizon, descried the roof of the
      boundary-rider's hut still gleaming in the sunlight. He remembered the hut
      well. It could not be farther than four miles, if as much as that, from
      this point of the track. He also knew these dust-storms of old; Bindarra
      was notorious for them: Without thinking twice, Alfred put spurs to his
      horse and headed for the hut. Before he had ridden half the distance the
      detached clouds of sand banded together in one dense whirlwind, and it was
      only owing to his horse's instinct that he did not ride wide of the hut
      altogether; for during the last half-mile he never saw the hut, until its
      outline loomed suddenly over his horse's ears; and by then the sun was
      invisible.&mdash;<br /><br /> "A Bride from the Bush."

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
