<p>Chapter V. Tom as a patrician.</p>

<p>Tom Canty, left alone in the prince's cabinet, made good use of his
opportunity. &nbsp;He turned himself this way and that before the great
mirror, admiring his finery; then walked away, imitating the prince's
high-bred carriage, and still observing results in the glass. &nbsp;Next he
drew the beautiful sword, and bowed, kissing the blade, and laying it
across his breast, as he had seen a noble knight do, by way of salute to
the lieutenant of the Tower, five or six weeks before, when delivering
the great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity. &nbsp;Tom
played with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh; he examined the
costly and exquisite ornaments of the room; he tried each of the
sumptuous chairs, and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court
herd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur. &nbsp;He wondered if they
would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home, or if
they would shake their heads, and say his overtaxed imagination had at
last upset his reason.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the prince
was gone a long time; then right away he began to feel lonely; very soon
he fell to listening and longing, and ceased to toy with the pretty
things about him; he grew uneasy, then restless, then distressed.
Suppose some one should come, and catch him in the prince's clothes, and
the prince not there to explain. &nbsp;Might they not hang him at once, and
inquire into his case afterward? &nbsp;He had heard that the great were prompt
about small matters. &nbsp;His fear rose higher and higher; and trembling he
softly opened the door to the antechamber, resolved to fly and seek the
prince, and, through him, protection and release. &nbsp;Six gorgeous
gentlemen-servants and two young pages of high degree, clothed like
butterflies, sprang to their feet and bowed low before him. &nbsp;He stepped
quickly back and shut the door. &nbsp;He said&mdash;</p>

<br><br>
<a name="05-058"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="05-058.jpg (138K)" src="images/05-058.jpg" height="843" width="717">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>"Oh, they mock at me! &nbsp;They will go and tell. &nbsp;Oh! why came I here to
cast away my life?"</p>

<p>He walked up and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening,
starting at every trifling sound. &nbsp;Presently the door swung open, and a
silken page said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Lady Jane Grey."</p>

<p>The door closed and a sweet young girl, richly clad, bounded toward him.
But she stopped suddenly, and said in a distressed voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, what aileth thee, my lord?"</p>

<p>Tom's breath was nearly failing him; but he made shift to stammer out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, be merciful, thou! &nbsp;In sooth I am no lord, but only poor Tom Canty
of Offal Court in the city. &nbsp;Prithee let me see the prince, and he will
of his grace restore to me my rags, and let me hence unhurt. &nbsp;Oh, be thou
merciful, and save me!"</p>

<p>By this time the boy was on his knees, and supplicating with his eyes and
uplifted hands as well as with his tongue. &nbsp;The young girl seemed
horror-stricken. &nbsp;She cried out&mdash;</p>

<br><br>
<a name="05-059"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="05-059.jpg (104K)" src="images/05-059.jpg" height="655" width="708">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>"O my lord, on thy knees?&mdash;and to ME!"</p>

<p>Then she fled away in fright; and Tom, smitten with despair, sank down,
murmuring&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is no help, there is no hope. &nbsp;Now will they come and take me."</p>

<p>Whilst he lay there benumbed with terror, dreadful tidings were speeding
through the palace. &nbsp;The whisper&mdash;for it was whispered always&mdash;flew from
menial to menial, from lord to lady, down all the long corridors, from
story to story, from saloon to saloon, "The prince hath gone mad, the
prince hath gone mad!" &nbsp;Soon every saloon, every marble hall, had its
groups of glittering lords and ladies, and other groups of dazzling
lesser folk, talking earnestly together in whispers, and every face had
in it dismay. Presently a splendid official came marching by these
groups, making solemn proclamation&mdash;</p>

<p>"IN THE NAME OF THE KING!</p>

<p>Let none list to this false and foolish matter, upon pain of death, nor
discuss the same, nor carry it abroad. &nbsp;In the name of the King!"</p>

<p>The whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been stricken
dumb.</p>

<p>Soon there was a general buzz along the corridors, of "The prince! See,
the prince comes!"</p>

<p>Poor Tom came slowly walking past the low-bowing groups, trying to bow in
return, and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings with bewildered
and pathetic eyes. &nbsp;Great nobles walked upon each side of him, making him
lean upon them, and so steady his steps. Behind him followed the
court-physicians and some servants.</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Presently Tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace and heard
the door close behind him. &nbsp;Around him stood those who had come with him.
Before him, at a little distance, reclined a very large and very fat man,
with a wide, pulpy face, and a stern expression. &nbsp;His large head was very
grey; and his whiskers, which he wore only around his face, like a frame,
were grey also. &nbsp;His clothing was of rich stuff, but old, and slightly
frayed in places. &nbsp;One of his swollen legs had a pillow under it, and was
wrapped in bandages. &nbsp;There was silence now; and there was no head there
but was bent in reverence, except this man's. &nbsp;This stern-countenanced
invalid was the dread Henry VIII. &nbsp;He said&mdash;and his face grew gentle as
he began to speak&mdash;</p>

<p>"How now, my lord Edward, my prince? &nbsp;Hast been minded to cozen me, the
good King thy father, who loveth thee, and kindly useth thee, with a
sorry jest?"</p>

<p>Poor Tom was listening, as well as his dazed faculties would let him, to
the beginning of this speech; but when the words 'me, the good King' fell
upon his ear, his face blanched, and he dropped as instantly upon his
knees as if a shot had brought him there. Lifting up his hands, he
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<br><br>
<a name="05-062"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="05-062.jpg (111K)" src="images/05-062.jpg" height="589" width="708">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Thou the KING? &nbsp;Then am I undone indeed!"</p>

<p>This speech seemed to stun the King. &nbsp;His eyes wandered from face to face
aimlessly, then rested, bewildered, upon the boy before him. &nbsp;Then he
said in a tone of deep disappointment&mdash;</p>

<p>"Alack, I had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth; but I
fear me 'tis not so." &nbsp;He breathed a heavy sigh, and said in a gentle
voice, "Come to thy father, child: &nbsp;thou art not well."</p>

<p>Tom was assisted to his feet, and approached the Majesty of England,
humble and trembling. &nbsp;The King took the frightened face between his
hands, and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it awhile, as if seeking
some grateful sign of returning reason there, then pressed the curly head
against his breast, and patted it tenderly. &nbsp;Presently he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dost not know thy father, child? &nbsp;Break not mine old heart; say thou
know'st me. &nbsp;Thou DOST know me, dost thou not?"</p>

<p>"Yea: &nbsp;thou art my dread lord the King, whom God preserve!"</p>

<p>"True, true&mdash;that is well&mdash;be comforted, tremble not so; there is none
here would hurt thee; there is none here but loves thee. Thou art better
now; thy ill dream passeth&mdash;is't not so? &nbsp;Thou wilt not miscall thyself
again, as they say thou didst a little while agone?"</p>

<p>"I pray thee of thy grace believe me, I did but speak the truth, most
dread lord; for I am the meanest among thy subjects, being a pauper born,
and 'tis by a sore mischance and accident I am here, albeit I was therein
nothing blameful. &nbsp;I am but young to die, and thou canst save me with one
little word. &nbsp;Oh speak it, sir!"</p>

<p>"Die? &nbsp;Talk not so, sweet prince&mdash;peace, peace, to thy troubled
heart&mdash;thou shalt not die!"</p>

<p>Tom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry&mdash;</p>

<p>"God requite thy mercy, O my King, and save thee long to bless thy land!"
Then springing up, he turned a joyful face toward the two lords in
waiting, and exclaimed, "Thou heard'st it! &nbsp;I am not to die: &nbsp;the King
hath said it!" &nbsp;There was no movement, save that all bowed with grave
respect; but no one spoke. &nbsp;He hesitated, a little confused, then turned
timidly toward the King, saying, "I may go now?"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="05-064"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="05-064.jpg (126K)" src="images/05-064.jpg" height="669" width="718">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Go? &nbsp;Surely, if thou desirest. &nbsp;But why not tarry yet a little? Whither
would'st go?"</p>

<p>Tom dropped his eyes, and answered humbly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peradventure I mistook; but I did think me free, and so was I moved to
seek again the kennel where I was born and bred to misery, yet which
harboureth my mother and my sisters, and so is home to me; whereas these
pomps and splendours whereunto I am not used&mdash;oh, please you, sir, to let
me go!"</p>

<p>The King was silent and thoughtful a while, and his face betrayed a
growing distress and uneasiness. &nbsp;Presently he said, with something of
hope in his voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Perchance he is but mad upon this one strain, and hath his wits unmarred
as toucheth other matter. &nbsp;God send it may be so! &nbsp;We will make trial."</p>

<p>Then he asked Tom a question in Latin, and Tom answered him lamely in the
same tongue. &nbsp;The lords and doctors manifested their gratification also.
The King said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Twas not according to his schooling and ability, but showeth that his
mind is but diseased, not stricken fatally. &nbsp;How say you, sir?"</p>

<p>The physician addressed bowed low, and replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"It jumpeth with my own conviction, sire, that thou hast divined aright."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="05-065"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="05-065.jpg (123K)" src="images/05-065.jpg" height="659" width="706">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>The King looked pleased with this encouragement, coming as it did from so
excellent authority, and continued with good heart&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now mark ye all: &nbsp;we will try him further."</p>

<p>He put a question to Tom in French. &nbsp;Tom stood silent a moment,
embarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him, then said
diffidently&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have no knowledge of this tongue, so please your majesty."</p>

<p>The King fell back upon his couch. &nbsp;The attendants flew to his
assistance; but he put them aside, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Trouble me not&mdash;it is nothing but a scurvy faintness. &nbsp;Raise me! There,
'tis sufficient. &nbsp;Come hither, child; there, rest thy poor troubled head
upon thy father's heart, and be at peace. &nbsp;Thou'lt soon be well: &nbsp;'tis
but a passing fantasy. &nbsp;Fear thou not; thou'lt soon be well." &nbsp;Then he
turned toward the company: &nbsp;his gentle manner changed, and baleful
lightnings began to play from his eyes. &nbsp;He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"List ye all! &nbsp;This my son is mad; but it is not permanent. &nbsp;Over-study
hath done this, and somewhat too much of confinement. &nbsp;Away with his
books and teachers! see ye to it. &nbsp;Pleasure him with sports, beguile him
in wholesome ways, so that his health come again." &nbsp;He raised himself
higher still, and went on with energy, "He is mad; but he is my son, and
England's heir; and, mad or sane, still shall he reign! &nbsp;And hear ye
further, and proclaim it: whoso speaketh of this his distemper worketh
against the peace and order of these realms, and shall to the gallows!
. . . Give me to drink&mdash;I burn: &nbsp;this sorrow sappeth my strength. . . .
There, take away the cup. . . . Support me. &nbsp;There, that is well. &nbsp;Mad,
is he? &nbsp;Were he a thousand times mad, yet is he Prince of Wales, and I the
King will confirm it. &nbsp;This very morrow shall he be installed in his
princely dignity in due and ancient form. &nbsp;Take instant order for it, my
lord Hertford."</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="05-067.jpg (162K)" src="images/05-067.jpg" height="1037" width="736">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>One of the nobles knelt at the royal couch, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The King's majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of England
lieth attainted in the Tower. &nbsp;It were not meet that one attainted&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace! &nbsp;Insult not mine ears with his hated name. &nbsp;Is this man to live
for ever? &nbsp;Am I to be baulked of my will? &nbsp;Is the prince to tarry
uninstalled, because, forsooth, the realm lacketh an Earl Marshal free of
treasonable taint to invest him with his honours? No, by the splendour of
God! &nbsp;Warn my Parliament to bring me Norfolk's doom before the sun rise
again, else shall they answer for it grievously!" {1}</p>

<p>Lord Hertford said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The King's will is law;" and, rising, returned to his former place.</p>


<br><br>
<a name="05-068"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="05-068.jpg (114K)" src="images/05-068.jpg" height="663" width="732">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Gradually the wrath faded out of the old King's face, and he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Kiss me, my prince. &nbsp;There . . . what fearest thou? &nbsp;Am I not thy loving
father?"</p>

<p>"Thou art good to me that am unworthy, O mighty and gracious lord: that
in truth I know. &nbsp;But&mdash;but&mdash;it grieveth me to think of him that is to
die, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, 'tis like thee, 'tis like thee! &nbsp;I know thy heart is still the same,
even though thy mind hath suffered hurt, for thou wert ever of a gentle
spirit. &nbsp;But this duke standeth between thee and thine honours: &nbsp;I will
have another in his stead that shall bring no taint to his great office.
Comfort thee, my prince: &nbsp;trouble not thy poor head with this matter."</p>

<p>"But is it not I that speed him hence, my liege? &nbsp;How long might he not
live, but for me?"</p>

<p>"Take no thought of him, my prince: &nbsp;he is not worthy. &nbsp;Kiss me once
again, and go to thy trifles and amusements; for my malady distresseth
me. &nbsp;I am aweary, and would rest. &nbsp;Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy
people, and come again when my body is refreshed."</p>

<p>Tom, heavy-hearted, was conducted from the presence, for this last
sentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would
be set free. &nbsp;Once more he heard the buzz of low voices exclaiming, "The
prince, the prince comes!"</p>

<p>His spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the glittering files
of bowing courtiers; for he recognised that he was indeed a captive now,
and might remain for ever shut up in this gilded cage, a forlorn and
friendless prince, except God in his mercy take pity on him and set him
free.</p>

<p>And, turn where he would, he seemed to see floating in the air the
severed head and the remembered face of the great Duke of Norfolk, the
eyes fixed on him reproachfully.</p>

<p>His old dreams had been so pleasant; but this reality was so dreary!</p>

<p>Chapter VI. Tom receives instructions.</p>

<p>Tom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite, and made
to sit down&mdash;a thing which he was loth to do, since there were elderly
men and men of high degree about him. &nbsp;He begged them to be seated also,
but they only bowed their thanks or murmured them, and remained standing.
He would have insisted, but his 'uncle' the Earl of Hertford whispered in
his ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"Prithee, insist not, my lord; it is not meet that they sit in thy
presence."</p>

<p>The Lord St. John was announced, and after making obeisance to Tom, he
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I come upon the King's errand, concerning a matter which requireth
privacy. &nbsp;Will it please your royal highness to dismiss all that attend
you here, save my lord the Earl of Hertford?"</p>

<p>Observing that Tom did not seem to know how to proceed, Hertford
whispered him to make a sign with his hand, and not trouble himself to
speak unless he chose. &nbsp;When the waiting gentlemen had retired, Lord St.
John said&mdash;</p>

<p>"His majesty commandeth, that for due and weighty reasons of state, the
prince's grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that be within his
power, till it be passed and he be as he was before. &nbsp;To wit, that he
shall deny to none that he is the true prince, and heir to England's
greatness; that he shall uphold his princely dignity, and shall receive,
without word or sign of protest, that reverence and observance which unto
it do appertain of right and ancient usage; that he shall cease to speak
to any of that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured out of the
unwholesome imaginings of o'er-wrought fancy; that he shall strive with
diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which he was wont to
know&mdash;and where he faileth he shall hold his peace, neither betraying by
semblance of surprise or other sign that he hath forgot; that upon
occasions of state, whensoever any matter shall perplex him as to the
thing he should do or the utterance he should make, he shall show nought
of unrest to the curious that look on, but take advice in that matter of
the Lord Hertford, or my humble self, which are commanded of the King to
be upon this service and close at call, till this commandment be
dissolved. Thus saith the King's majesty, who sendeth greeting to your
royal highness, and prayeth that God will of His mercy quickly heal you
and have you now and ever in His holy keeping."</p>

<p>The Lord St. John made reverence and stood aside. &nbsp;Tom replied
resignedly&mdash;</p>



<br><br>
<a name="06-075"></a>
<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>"The King hath said it. &nbsp;None may palter with the King's command, or fit
it to his ease, where it doth chafe, with deft evasions. The King shall
be obeyed."</p>

<p>Lord Hertford said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Touching the King's majesty's ordainment concerning books and such like
serious matters, it may peradventure please your highness to ease your
time with lightsome entertainment, lest you go wearied to the banquet and
suffer harm thereby."</p>

<p>Tom's face showed inquiring surprise; and a blush followed when he saw
Lord St. John's eyes bent sorrowfully upon him. &nbsp;His lordship said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thy memory still wrongeth thee, and thou hast shown surprise&mdash;but suffer
it not to trouble thee, for 'tis a matter that will not bide, but depart
with thy mending malady. &nbsp;My Lord of Hertford speaketh of the city's
banquet which the King's majesty did promise, some two months flown, your
highness should attend. &nbsp;Thou recallest it now?"</p>

<p>"It grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me," said Tom, in a
hesitating voice; and blushed again.</p>

<p>At this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were announced.
The two lords exchanged significant glances, and Hertford stepped quickly
toward the door. &nbsp;As the young girls passed him, he said in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I pray ye, ladies, seem not to observe his humours, nor show surprise
when his memory doth lapse&mdash;it will grieve you to note how it doth stick
at every trifle."</p>


<br><br>
<a name="06-077"></a>
<br><br>

<img alt="06-077.jpg (101K)" src="images/06-077.jpg" height="616" width="707">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>Meantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom's ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please you, sir, keep diligently in mind his majesty's desire. Remember
all thou canst&mdash;SEEM to remember all else. &nbsp;Let them not perceive that
thou art much changed from thy wont, for thou knowest how tenderly thy
old play-fellows bear thee in their hearts and how 'twould grieve them.
Art willing, sir, that I remain?&mdash;and thine uncle?"</p>

<p>Tom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word, for he was
already learning, and in his simple heart was resolved to acquit himself
as best he might, according to the King's command.</p>

<p>In spite of every precaution, the conversation among the young people
became a little embarrassing at times. &nbsp;More than once, in truth, Tom was
near to breaking down and confessing himself unequal to his tremendous
part; but the tact of the Princess Elizabeth saved him, or a word from
one or the other of the vigilant lords, thrown in apparently by chance,
had the same happy effect. &nbsp;Once the little Lady Jane turned to Tom and
dismayed him with this question,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hast paid thy duty to the Queen's majesty to-day, my lord?"</p>

<p>Tom hesitated, looked distressed, and was about to stammer out something
at hazard, when Lord St. John took the word and answered for him with the
easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter delicate difficulties
and to be ready for them&mdash;</p>

<p>"He hath indeed, madam, and she did greatly hearten him, as touching his
majesty's condition; is it not so, your highness?"</p>

<p>Tom mumbled something that stood for assent, but felt that he was getting
upon dangerous ground. &nbsp;Somewhat later it was mentioned that Tom was to
study no more at present, whereupon her little ladyship exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis a pity, 'tis a pity! &nbsp;Thou wert proceeding bravely. &nbsp;But bide thy
time in patience: &nbsp;it will not be for long. &nbsp;Thou'lt yet be graced with
learning like thy father, and make thy tongue master of as many languages
as his, good my prince."</p>

<p>"My father!" cried Tom, off his guard for the moment. &nbsp;"I trow he cannot
speak his own so that any but the swine that kennel in the styes may tell
his meaning; and as for learning of any sort soever&mdash;"</p>

<p>He looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my Lord St. John's eyes.</p>

<p>He stopped, blushed, then continued low and sadly: "Ah, my malady
persecuteth me again, and my mind wandereth. &nbsp;I meant the King's grace no
irreverence."</p>

<p>"We know it, sir," said the Princess Elizabeth, taking her 'brother's'
hand between her two palms, respectfully but caressingly; "trouble not
thyself as to that. &nbsp;The fault is none of thine, but thy distemper's."</p>

<p>"Thou'rt a gentle comforter, sweet lady," said Tom, gratefully, "and my
heart moveth me to thank thee for't, an' I may be so bold."</p>

<p>Once the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at Tom. &nbsp;The
Princess Elizabeth's quick eye saw by the serene blankness of the
target's front that the shaft was overshot; so she tranquilly delivered a
return volley of sounding Greek on Tom's behalf, and then straightway
changed the talk to other matters.</p>

<p>Time wore on pleasantly, and likewise smoothly, on the whole. Snags and
sandbars grew less and less frequent, and Tom grew more and more at his
ease, seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon helping him and
overlooking his mistakes. &nbsp;When it came out that the little ladies were
to accompany him to the Lord Mayor's banquet in the evening, his heart
gave a bound of relief and delight, for he felt that he should not be
friendless, now, among that multitude of strangers; whereas, an hour
earlier, the idea of their going with him would have been an
insupportable terror to him.</p>

<p>Tom's guardian angels, the two lords, had had less comfort in the
interview than the other parties to it. &nbsp;They felt much as if they were
piloting a great ship through a dangerous channel; they were on the alert
constantly, and found their office no child's play. Wherefore, at last,
when the ladies' visit was drawing to a close and the Lord Guilford
Dudley was announced, they not only felt that their charge had been
sufficiently taxed for the present, but also that they themselves were
not in the best condition to take their ship back and make their anxious
voyage all over again. &nbsp;So they respectfully advised Tom to excuse
himself, which he was very glad to do, although a slight shade of
disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane's face when she
heard the splendid stripling denied admittance.</p>


<br><br>
<a name="06-079"></a>
<br><br>

<img alt="06-079.jpg (89K)" src="images/06-079.jpg" height="435" width="666">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>There was a pause now, a sort of waiting silence which Tom could not
understand. &nbsp;He glanced at Lord Hertford, who gave him a sign&mdash;but he
failed to understand that also. &nbsp;The ready Elizabeth came to the rescue
with her usual easy grace. &nbsp;She made reverence and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have we leave of the prince's grace my brother to go?"</p>

<p>Tom said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will, for the
asking; yet would I rather give them any other thing that in my poor
power lieth, than leave to take the light and blessing of their presence
hence. &nbsp;Give ye good den, and God be with ye!" Then he smiled inwardly at
the thought, "'Tis not for nought I have dwelt but among princes in my
reading, and taught my tongue some slight trick of their broidered and
gracious speech withal!"</p>

<p>When the illustrious maidens were gone, Tom turned wearily to his keepers
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"May it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some corner
and rest me?"</p>

<p>Lord Hertford said&mdash;</p>

<p>"So please your highness, it is for you to command, it is for us to obey.
That thou should'st rest is indeed a needful thing, since thou must
journey to the city presently."</p>

<p>He touched a bell, and a page appeared, who was ordered to desire the
presence of Sir William Herbert. &nbsp;This gentleman came straightway, and
conducted Tom to an inner apartment. &nbsp;Tom's first movement there was to
reach for a cup of water; but a silk-and-velvet servitor seized it,
dropped upon one knee, and offered it to him on a golden salver.</p>


<br><br>
<a name="06-080"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="06-080.jpg (154K)" src="images/06-080.jpg" height="948" width="732">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>Next the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his buskins,
timidly asking leave with his eye, but another silk-and-velvet
discomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him. &nbsp;He
made two or three further efforts to help himself, but being promptly
forestalled each time, he finally gave up, with a sigh of resignation and
a murmured "Beshrew me, but I marvel they do not require to breathe for
me also!" &nbsp;Slippered, and wrapped in a sumptuous robe, he laid himself
down at last to rest, but not to sleep, for his head was too full of
thoughts and the room too full of people. &nbsp;He could not dismiss the
former, so they stayed; he did not know enough to dismiss the latter, so
they stayed also, to his vast regret&mdash;and theirs.</p>

<p>
Tom's departure had left his two noble guardians alone. &nbsp;They mused a
while, with much head-shaking and walking the floor, then Lord St. John
said&mdash;</p>


<br><br>
<a name="06-082"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="06-082.jpg (83K)" src="images/06-082.jpg" height="522" width="641">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>"Plainly, what dost thou think?"</p>

<p>"Plainly, then, this. &nbsp;The King is near his end; my nephew is mad&mdash;mad
will mount the throne, and mad remain. &nbsp;God protect England, since she
will need it!"</p>

<p>"Verily it promiseth so, indeed. &nbsp;But . . . have you no misgivings as to
. . . as to . . ."</p>

<p>The speaker hesitated, and finally stopped. &nbsp;He evidently felt that he
was upon delicate ground. &nbsp;Lord Hertford stopped before him, looked into
his face with a clear, frank eye, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Speak on&mdash;there is none to hear but me. &nbsp;Misgivings as to what?"</p>

<p>"I am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind, and thou so near to
him in blood, my lord. &nbsp;But craving pardon if I do offend, seemeth it not
strange that madness could so change his port and manner?&mdash;not but that
his port and speech are princely still, but that they DIFFER, in one
unweighty trifle or another, from what his custom was aforetime. &nbsp;Seemeth
it not strange that madness should filch from his memory his father's
very lineaments; the customs and observances that are his due from such
as be about him; and, leaving him his Latin, strip him of his Greek and
French? &nbsp;My lord, be not offended, but ease my mind of its disquiet and
receive my grateful thanks. &nbsp;It haunteth me, his saying he was not the
prince, and so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace, my lord, thou utterest treason! &nbsp;Hast forgot the King's command?
Remember I am party to thy crime if I but listen."</p>


<br><br>
<a name="06-083"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="06-083.jpg (108K)" src="images/06-083.jpg" height="580" width="718">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>St. John paled, and hastened to say&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was in fault, I do confess it. &nbsp;Betray me not, grant me this grace out
of thy courtesy, and I will neither think nor speak of this thing more.
Deal not hardly with me, sir, else am I ruined."</p>

<p>"I am content, my lord. &nbsp;So thou offend not again, here or in the ears of
others, it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken. &nbsp;But thou need'st
not have misgivings. &nbsp;He is my sister's son; are not his voice, his face,
his form, familiar to me from his cradle? Madness can do all the odd
conflicting things thou seest in him, and more. &nbsp;Dost not recall how that
the old Baron Marley, being mad, forgot the favour of his own countenance
that he had known for sixty years, and held it was another's; nay, even
claimed he was the son of Mary Magdalene, and that his head was made of
Spanish glass; and, sooth to say, he suffered none to touch it, lest by
mischance some heedless hand might shiver it? &nbsp;Give thy misgivings
easement, good my lord. &nbsp;This is the very prince&mdash;I know him well&mdash;and
soon will be thy king; it may advantage thee to bear this in mind, and
more dwell upon it than the other."</p>

<p>After some further talk, in which the Lord St. John covered up his
mistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith was
thoroughly grounded now, and could not be assailed by doubts again, the
Lord Hertford relieved his fellow-keeper, and sat down to keep watch and
ward alone. &nbsp;He was soon deep in meditation, and evidently the longer he
thought, the more he was bothered. &nbsp;By-and-by he began to pace the floor
and mutter.</p>


<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>"Tush, he MUST be the prince! &nbsp;Will any be in all the land maintain there
can be two, not of one blood and birth, so marvellously twinned? &nbsp;And
even were it so, 'twere yet a stranger miracle that chance should cast
the one into the other's place. Nay, 'tis folly, folly, folly!"</p>

<p>Presently he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now were he impostor and called himself prince, look you THAT would be
natural; that would be reasonable. &nbsp;But lived ever an impostor yet, who,
being called prince by the king, prince by the court, prince by all,
DENIED his dignity and pleaded against his exaltation? &nbsp;NO! &nbsp;By the soul
of St. Swithin, no! &nbsp;This is the true prince, gone mad!"</p>

<p>Chapter VII. Tom's first royal dinner.</p>

<p>Somewhat after one in the afternoon, Tom resignedly underwent the ordeal
of being dressed for dinner. &nbsp;He found himself as finely clothed as
before, but everything different, everything changed, from his ruff to
his stockings. &nbsp;He was presently conducted with much state to a spacious
and ornate apartment, where a table was already set for one. &nbsp;Its
furniture was all of massy gold, and beautified with designs which
well-nigh made it priceless, since they were the work of Benvenuto. &nbsp;The room
was half-filled with noble servitors. &nbsp;A chaplain said grace, and Tom was
about to fall to, for hunger had long been constitutional with him, but
was interrupted by my lord the Earl of Berkeley, who fastened a napkin
about his neck; for the great post of Diaperers to the Prince of Wales
was hereditary in this nobleman's family. &nbsp;Tom's cupbearer was present,
and forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine. &nbsp;The Taster to
his highness the Prince of Wales was there also, prepared to taste any
suspicious dish upon requirement, and run the risk of being poisoned. &nbsp;He
was only an ornamental appendage at this time, and was seldom called upon
to exercise his function; but there had been times, not many generations
past, when the office of taster had its perils, and was not a grandeur to
be desired. &nbsp;Why they did not use a dog or a plumber seems strange; but
all the ways of royalty are strange. &nbsp;My Lord d'Arcy, First Groom of the
Chamber, was there, to do goodness knows what; but there he was&mdash;let that
suffice. &nbsp;The Lord Chief Butler was there, and stood behind Tom's chair,
overseeing the solemnities, under command of the Lord Great Steward and
the Lord Head Cook, who stood near. &nbsp;Tom had three hundred and
eighty-four servants beside these; but they were not all in that room, of
course, nor the quarter of them; neither was Tom aware yet that they
existed.</p>

<p>All those that were present had been well drilled within the hour to
remember that the prince was temporarily out of his head, and to be
careful to show no surprise at his vagaries. &nbsp;These 'vagaries' were soon
on exhibition before them; but they only moved their compassion and their
sorrow, not their mirth. &nbsp;It was a heavy affliction to them to see the
beloved prince so stricken.</p>

<p>Poor Tom ate with his fingers mainly; but no one smiled at it, or even
seemed to observe it. &nbsp;He inspected his napkin curiously, and with deep
interest, for it was of a very dainty and beautiful fabric, then said
with simplicity&mdash;</p>

<p>"Prithee, take it away, lest in mine unheedfulness it be soiled."</p>

<p>The Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner, and without
word or protest of any sort.</p>


<br><br>
<a name="07-091"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="07-091.jpg (156K)" src="images/07-091.jpg" height="913" width="735">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>Tom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest, and asked what
they were, and if they were to be eaten; for it was only recently that
men had begun to raise these things in England in place of importing them
as luxuries from Holland. {1} &nbsp;His question was answered with grave
respect, and no surprise manifested. &nbsp;When he had finished his dessert,
he filled his pockets with nuts; but nobody appeared to be aware of it,
or disturbed by it. &nbsp;But the next moment he was himself disturbed by it,
and showed discomposure; for this was the only service he had been
permitted to do with his own hands during the meal, and he did not doubt
that he had done a most improper and unprincely thing. &nbsp;At that moment
the muscles of his nose began to twitch, and the end of that organ to
lift and wrinkle. &nbsp;This continued, and Tom began to evince a growing
distress. &nbsp;He looked appealingly, first at one and then another of the
lords about him, and tears came into his eyes. &nbsp;They sprang forward with
dismay in their faces, and begged to know his trouble. &nbsp;Tom said with
genuine anguish&mdash;</p>

<p>"I crave your indulgence: &nbsp;my nose itcheth cruelly. &nbsp;What is the custom
and usage in this emergence? &nbsp;Prithee, speed, for 'tis but a little time
that I can bear it."</p>

<p>None smiled; but all were sore perplexed, and looked one to the other in
deep tribulation for counsel. &nbsp;But behold, here was a dead wall, and
nothing in English history to tell how to get over it. &nbsp;The Master of
Ceremonies was not present: &nbsp;there was no one who felt safe to venture
upon this uncharted sea, or risk the attempt to solve this solemn
problem. &nbsp;Alas! there was no Hereditary Scratcher. &nbsp;Meantime the tears
had overflowed their banks, and begun to trickle down Tom's cheeks. &nbsp;His
twitching nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief. &nbsp;At last
nature broke down the barriers of etiquette: &nbsp;Tom lifted up an inward
prayer for pardon if he was doing wrong, and brought relief to the
burdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself.</p>

<p>His meal being ended, a lord came and held before him a broad, shallow,
golden dish with fragrant rosewater in it, to cleanse his mouth and
fingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by with a napkin
for his use. &nbsp;Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two, then raised
it to his lips, and gravely took a draught. &nbsp;Then he returned it to the
waiting lord, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nay, it likes me not, my lord: &nbsp;it hath a pretty flavour, but it wanteth
strength."</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>This new eccentricity of the prince's ruined mind made all the hearts
about him ache; but the sad sight moved none to merriment.</p>

<p>Tom's next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table just
when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and with uplifted
hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was in the act of beginning the
blessing. &nbsp;Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done a
thing unusual.</p>

<p>By his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private
cabinet, and left there alone to his own devices. &nbsp;Hanging upon hooks in
the oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel
armour, covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid in
gold. &nbsp;This martial panoply belonged to the true prince&mdash;a recent present
from Madam Parr the Queen. Tom put on the greaves, the gauntlets, the
plumed helmet, and such other pieces as he could don without assistance,
and for a while was minded to call for help and complete the matter, but
bethought him of the nuts he had brought away from dinner, and the joy it
would be to eat them with no crowd to eye him, and no Grand Hereditaries
to pester him with undesired services; so he restored the pretty things
to their several places, and soon was cracking nuts, and feeling almost
naturally happy for the first time since God for his sins had made him a
prince. &nbsp;When the nuts were all gone, he stumbled upon some inviting
books in a closet, among them one about the etiquette of the English
court. &nbsp;This was a prize. He lay down upon a sumptuous divan, and
proceeded to instruct himself with honest zeal. &nbsp;Let us leave him there
for the present.</p>
