<p>Chapter XXII. A victim of treachery.</p>

<p>Once more 'King Foo-foo the First' was roving with the tramps and
outlaws, a butt for their coarse jests and dull-witted railleries, and
sometimes the victim of small spitefulness at the hands of Canty and Hugo
when the Ruffler's back was turned. &nbsp;None but Canty and Hugo really
disliked him. &nbsp;Some of the others liked him, and all admired his pluck
and spirit. &nbsp;During two or three days, Hugo, in whose ward and charge the
King was, did what he covertly could to make the boy uncomfortable; and
at night, during the customary orgies, he amused the company by putting
small indignities upon him&mdash;always as if by accident. &nbsp;Twice he stepped
upon the King's toes&mdash;accidentally&mdash;and the King, as became his royalty,
was contemptuously unconscious of it and indifferent to it; but the third
time Hugo entertained himself in that way, the King felled him to the
ground with a cudgel, to the prodigious delight of the tribe. &nbsp;Hugo,
consumed with anger and shame, sprang up, seized a cudgel, and came at
his small adversary in a fury. &nbsp;Instantly a ring was formed around the
gladiators, and the betting and cheering began.

<p>
But poor Hugo stood no
chance whatever. &nbsp;His frantic and lubberly 'prentice-work found but a
poor market for itself when pitted against an arm which had been trained
by the first masters of Europe in single-stick, quarter-staff, and every
art and trick of swordsmanship. &nbsp;The little King stood, alert but at
graceful ease, and caught and turned aside the thick rain of blows with a
facility and precision which set the motley on-lookers wild with
admiration; and every now and then, when his practised eye detected an
opening, and a lightning-swift rap upon Hugo's head followed as a result,
the storm of cheers and laughter that swept the place was something
wonderful to hear. &nbsp;At the end of fifteen minutes, Hugo, all battered,
bruised, and the target for a pitiless bombardment of ridicule, slunk
from the field; and the unscathed hero of the fight was seized and borne
aloft upon the shoulders of the joyous rabble to the place of honour
beside the Ruffler, where with vast ceremony he was crowned King of the
Game-Cocks; his meaner title being at the same time solemnly cancelled
and annulled, and a decree of banishment from the gang pronounced against
any who should thenceforth utter it.</p>

<p>All attempts to make the King serviceable to the troop had failed. He had
stubbornly refused to act; moreover, he was always trying to escape. &nbsp;He
had been thrust into an unwatched kitchen, the first day of his return;
he not only came forth empty-handed, but tried to rouse the housemates.
He was sent out with a tinker to help him at his work; he would not work;
moreover, he threatened the tinker with his own soldering-iron; and
finally both Hugo and the tinker found their hands full with the mere
matter of keeping his from getting away. &nbsp;He delivered the thunders of
his royalty upon the heads of all who hampered his liberties or tried to
force him to service. &nbsp;He was sent out, in Hugo's charge, in company with
a slatternly woman and a diseased baby, to beg; but the result was not
encouraging&mdash;he declined to plead for the mendicants, or be a party to
their cause in any way.</p>

<p>Thus several days went by; and the miseries of this tramping life, and
the weariness and sordidness and meanness and vulgarity of it, became
gradually and steadily so intolerable to the captive that he began at
last to feel that his release from the hermit's knife must prove only a
temporary respite from death, at best.</p>

<p>But at night, in his dreams, these things were forgotten, and he was on
his throne, and master again. &nbsp;This, of course, intensified the
sufferings of the awakening&mdash;so the mortifications of each succeeding
morning of the few that passed between his return to bondage and the
combat with Hugo, grew bitterer and bitterer, and harder and harder to
bear.</p>

<p>The morning after that combat, Hugo got up with a heart filled with
vengeful purposes against the King. &nbsp;He had two plans, in particular.
One was to inflict upon the lad what would be, to his proud spirit and
'imagined' royalty, a peculiar humiliation; and if he failed to
accomplish this, his other plan was to put a crime of some kind upon the
King, and then betray him into the implacable clutches of the law.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the first plan, he purposed to put a 'clime' upon the
King's leg; rightly judging that that would mortify him to the last and
perfect degree; and as soon as the clime should operate, he meant to get
Canty's help, and FORCE the King to expose his leg in the highway and beg
for alms. &nbsp;'Clime' was the cant term for a sore, artificially created.
To make a clime, the operator made a paste or poultice of unslaked lime,
soap, and the rust of old iron, and spread it upon a piece of leather,
which was then bound tightly upon the leg. &nbsp;This would presently fret off
the skin, and make the flesh raw and angry-looking; blood was then rubbed
upon the limb, which, being fully dried, took on a dark and repulsive
colour. &nbsp;Then a bandage of soiled rags was put on in a cleverly careless
way which would allow the hideous ulcer to be seen, and move the
compassion of the passer-by. {8}</p>

<p>Hugo got the help of the tinker whom the King had cowed with the
soldering-iron; they took the boy out on a tinkering tramp, and as soon
as they were out of sight of the camp they threw him down and the tinker
held him while Hugo bound the poultice tight and fast upon his leg.</p>

<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>The King raged and stormed, and promised to hang the two the moment the
sceptre was in his hand again; but they kept a firm grip upon him and
enjoyed his impotent struggling and jeered at his threats. &nbsp;This
continued until the poultice began to bite; and in no long time its work
would have been perfected, if there had been no interruption. &nbsp;But there
was; for about this time the 'slave' who had made the speech denouncing
England's laws, appeared on the scene, and put an end to the enterprise,
and stripped off the poultice and bandage.</p>

<p>The King wanted to borrow his deliverer's cudgel and warm the jackets of
the two rascals on the spot; but the man said no, it would bring
trouble&mdash;leave the matter till night; the whole tribe being together, then, the
outside world would not venture to interfere or interrupt. &nbsp;He marched
the party back to camp and reported the affair to the Ruffler, who
listened, pondered, and then decided that the King should not be again
detailed to beg, since it was plain he was worthy of something higher and
better&mdash;wherefore, on the spot he promoted him from the mendicant rank
and appointed him to steal!</p>

<p>Hugo was overjoyed. &nbsp;He had already tried to make the King steal, and
failed; but there would be no more trouble of that sort, now, for of
course the King would not dream of defying a distinct command delivered
directly from head-quarters. &nbsp;So he planned a raid for that very
afternoon, purposing to get the King in the law's grip in the course of
it; and to do it, too, with such ingenious strategy, that it should seem
to be accidental and unintentional; for the King of the Game-Cocks was
popular now, and the gang might not deal over-gently with an unpopular
member who played so serious a treachery upon him as the delivering him
over to the common enemy, the law.</p>

<p>Very well. &nbsp;All in good time Hugo strolled off to a neighbouring village
with his prey; and the two drifted slowly up and down one street after
another, the one watching sharply for a sure chance to achieve his evil
purpose, and the other watching as sharply for a chance to dart away and
get free of his infamous captivity for ever.</p>

<p>Both threw away some tolerably fair-looking opportunities; for both, in
their secret hearts, were resolved to make absolutely sure work this
time, and neither meant to allow his fevered desires to seduce him into
any venture that had much uncertainty about it.</p>

<p>Hugo's chance came first. &nbsp;For at last a woman approached who carried a
fat package of some sort in a basket. &nbsp;Hugo's eyes sparkled with sinful
pleasure as he said to himself, "Breath o' my life, an' I can but put
THAT upon him, 'tis good-den and God keep thee, King of the Game-Cocks!"
He waited and watched&mdash;outwardly patient, but inwardly consuming with
excitement&mdash;till the woman had passed by, and the time was ripe; then
said, in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<br><br>
<a name="22-274"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="22-274.jpg (135K)" src="images/22-274.jpg" height="729" width="734">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Tarry here till I come again," and darted stealthily after the prey.</p>

<p>The King's heart was filled with joy&mdash;he could make his escape, now, if
Hugo's quest only carried him far enough away.</p>

<p>But he was to have no such luck. &nbsp;Hugo crept behind the woman, snatched
the package, and came running back, wrapping it in an old piece of
blanket which he carried on his arm. &nbsp;The hue and cry was raised in a
moment, by the woman, who knew her loss by the lightening of her burden,
although she had not seen the pilfering done. &nbsp;Hugo thrust the bundle
into the King's hands without halting, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now speed ye after me with the rest, and cry 'Stop thief!' but mind ye
lead them astray!"</p>

<p>The next moment Hugo turned a corner and darted down a crooked alley&mdash;and
in another moment or two he lounged into view again, looking innocent and
indifferent, and took up a position behind a post to watch results.</p>

<p>The insulted King threw the bundle on the ground; and the blanket fell
away from it just as the woman arrived, with an augmenting crowd at her
heels; she seized the King's wrist with one hand, snatched up her bundle
with the other, and began to pour out a tirade of abuse upon the boy
while he struggled, without success, to free himself from her grip.</p>

<p>Hugo had seen enough&mdash;his enemy was captured and the law would get him,
now&mdash;so he slipped away, jubilant and chuckling, and wended campwards,
framing a judicious version of the matter to give to the Ruffler's crew
as he strode along.</p>

<p>The King continued to struggle in the woman's strong grasp, and now and
then cried out in vexation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Unhand me, thou foolish creature; it was not I that bereaved thee of thy
paltry goods."</p>

<p>The crowd closed around, threatening the King and calling him names; a
brawny blacksmith in leather apron, and sleeves rolled to his elbows,
made a reach for him, saying he would trounce him well, for a lesson; but
just then a long sword flashed in the air and fell with convincing force
upon the man's arm, flat side down, the fantastic owner of it remarking
pleasantly, at the same time&mdash;</p>

<p>"Marry, good souls, let us proceed gently, not with ill blood and
uncharitable words. &nbsp;This is matter for the law's consideration, not
private and unofficial handling. &nbsp;Loose thy hold from the boy, goodwife."</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>The blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance, then went
muttering away, rubbing his arm; the woman released the boy's wrist
reluctantly; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly, but prudently closed
their mouths. &nbsp;The King sprang to his deliverer's side, with flushed
cheeks and sparkling eyes, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou hast lagged sorely, but thou comest in good season, now, Sir Miles;
carve me this rabble to rags!"</p>

<p>Chapter XXIII. The Prince a prisoner.</p>

<p>Hendon forced back a smile, and bent down and whispered in the King's
ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"Softly, softly, my prince, wag thy tongue warily&mdash;nay, suffer it not to
wag at all. &nbsp;Trust in me&mdash;all shall go well in the end." Then he added to
himself: &nbsp;"SIR Miles! &nbsp;Bless me, I had totally forgot I was a knight!
Lord, how marvellous a thing it is, the grip his memory doth take upon
his quaint and crazy fancies! . . . An empty and foolish title is mine,
and yet it is something to have deserved it; for I think it is more
honour to be held worthy to be a spectre-knight in his Kingdom of Dreams
and Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of the
REAL kingdoms of this world."</p>

<p>The crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who approached and was about
to lay his hand upon the King's shoulder, when Hendon said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gently, good friend, withhold your hand&mdash;he shall go peaceably; I am
responsible for that. &nbsp;Lead on, we will follow."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="23-282"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="23-282.jpg (90K)" src="images/23-282.jpg" height="680" width="488">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>The officer led, with the woman and her bundle; Miles and the King
followed after, with the crowd at their heels. &nbsp;The King was inclined to
rebel; but Hendon said to him in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Reflect, Sire&mdash;your laws are the wholesome breath of your own royalty;
shall their source resist them, yet require the branches to respect them?
Apparently one of these laws has been broken; when the King is on his
throne again, can it ever grieve him to remember that when he was
seemingly a private person he loyally sank the king in the citizen and
submitted to its authority?"</p>

<p>"Thou art right; say no more; thou shalt see that whatsoever the King of
England requires a subject to suffer, under the law, he will himself
suffer while he holdeth the station of a subject."</p>

<p>When the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of the
peace, she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the person who
had committed the theft; there was none able to show the contrary, so the
King stood convicted. &nbsp;The bundle was now unrolled, and when the contents
proved to be a plump little dressed pig, the judge looked troubled,
whilst Hendon turned pale, and his body was thrilled with an electric
shiver of dismay; but the King remained unmoved, protected by his
ignorance. &nbsp;The judge meditated, during an ominous pause, then turned to
the woman, with the question&mdash;</p>

<p>"What dost thou hold this property to be worth?"</p>

<p>The woman courtesied and replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Three shillings and eightpence, your worship&mdash;I could not abate a penny
and set forth the value honestly."</p>

<p>The justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd, then nodded to
the constable, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Clear the court and close the doors."</p>

<p>It was done. &nbsp;None remained but the two officials, the accused, the
accuser, and Miles Hendon. &nbsp;This latter was rigid and colourless, and on
his forehead big drops of cold sweat gathered, broke and blended
together, and trickled down his face. &nbsp;The judge turned to the woman
again, and said, in a compassionate voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven hard by hunger, for
these be grievous times for the unfortunate; mark you, he hath not an
evil face&mdash;but when hunger driveth&mdash;Good woman! dost know that when one
steals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha'penny the law saith he
shall HANG for it?"</p>

<p>The little King started, wide-eyed with consternation, but controlled
himself and held his peace; but not so the woman. &nbsp;She sprang to her
feet, shaking with fright, and cried out&mdash;</p>

<br><br>
<a name="23-284"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="23-284.jpg (143K)" src="images/23-284.jpg" height="785" width="718">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Oh, good lack, what have I done! &nbsp;God-a-mercy, I would not hang the poor
thing for the whole world! &nbsp;Ah, save me from this, your worship&mdash;what
shall I do, what CAN I do?"</p>

<p>The justice maintained his judicial composure, and simply said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value, since it is not yet writ
upon the record."</p>

<p>"Then in God's name call the pig eightpence, and heaven bless the day
that freed my conscience of this awesome thing!"</p>

<p>Miles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; and surprised the King
and wounded his dignity, by throwing his arms around him and hugging him.
The woman made her grateful adieux and started away with her pig; and
when the constable opened the door for her, he followed her out into the
narrow hall. &nbsp;The justice proceeded to write in his record book. &nbsp;Hendon,
always alert, thought he would like to know why the officer followed the
woman out; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and listened. &nbsp;He
heard a conversation to this effect&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will buy it of thee; here
is the eightpence."</p>

<p>"Eightpence, indeed! &nbsp;Thou'lt do no such thing. &nbsp;It cost me three
shillings and eightpence, good honest coin of the last reign, that old
Harry that's just dead ne'er touched or tampered with. &nbsp;A fig for thy
eightpence!"</p>

<p>"Stands the wind in that quarter? &nbsp;Thou wast under oath, and so swore
falsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence. &nbsp;Come straightway
back with me before his worship, and answer for the crime!&mdash;and then the
lad will hang."</p>

<p>"There, there, dear heart, say no more, I am content. &nbsp;Give me the
eightpence, and hold thy peace about the matter."</p>

<p>The woman went off crying: &nbsp;Hendon slipped back into the court room, and
the constable presently followed, after hiding his prize in some
convenient place. &nbsp;The justice wrote a while longer, then read the King a
wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced him to a short imprisonment in the
common jail, to be followed by a public flogging. &nbsp;The astounded King
opened his mouth, and was probably going to order the good judge to be
beheaded on the spot; but he caught a warning sign from Hendon, and
succeeded in closing his mouth again before he lost anything out of it.
Hendon took him by the hand, now, made reverence to the justice, and the
two departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail. &nbsp;The moment
the street was reached, the inflamed monarch halted, snatched away his
hand, and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Idiot, dost imagine I will enter a common jail ALIVE?"</p>

<p>Hendon bent down and said, somewhat sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>"WILL you trust in me? &nbsp;Peace! and forbear to worsen our chances with
dangerous speech. &nbsp;What God wills, will happen; thou canst not hurry it,
thou canst not alter it; therefore wait, and be patient&mdash;'twill be time
enow to rail or rejoice when what is to happen has happened." {1}</p>

<p>Chapter XXIV. The escape.</p>

<p>The short winter day was nearly ended. &nbsp;The streets were deserted, save
for a few random stragglers, and these hurried straight along, with the
intent look of people who were only anxious to accomplish their errands
as quickly as possible, and then snugly house themselves from the rising
wind and the gathering twilight. They looked neither to the right nor to
the left; they paid no attention to our party, they did not even seem to
see them. Edward the Sixth wondered if the spectacle of a king on his way
to jail had ever encountered such marvellous indifference before.
By-and-by the constable arrived at a deserted market-square, and proceeded to
cross it. &nbsp;When he had reached the middle of it, Hendon laid his hand
upon his arm, and said in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bide a moment, good sir, there is none in hearing, and I would say a
word to thee."</p>

<p>"My duty forbids it, sir; prithee hinder me not, the night comes on."</p>

<p>"Stay, nevertheless, for the matter concerns thee nearly. &nbsp;Turn thy back
a moment and seem not to see: &nbsp;LET THIS POOR LAD ESCAPE."</p>

<p>"This to me, sir! &nbsp;I arrest thee in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, be not too hasty. &nbsp;See thou be careful and commit no foolish
error,"&mdash;then he shut his voice down to a whisper, and said in the man's
ear&mdash;"the pig thou hast purchased for eightpence may cost thee thy neck,
man!"</p>

<p>The poor constable, taken by surprise, was speechless, at first, then
found his tongue and fell to blustering and threatening; but Hendon was
tranquil, and waited with patience till his breath was spent; then said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have a liking to thee, friend, and would not willingly see thee come
to harm. &nbsp;Observe, I heard it all&mdash;every word. &nbsp;I will prove it to thee."
Then he repeated the conversation which the officer and the woman had had
together in the hall, word for word, and ended with&mdash;</p>

<p>"There&mdash;have I set it forth correctly? &nbsp;Should not I be able to set it
forth correctly before the judge, if occasion required?"</p>

<p>The man was dumb with fear and distress, for a moment; then he rallied,
and said with forced lightness&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis making a mighty matter, indeed, out of a jest; I but plagued the
woman for mine amusement."</p>

<p>"Kept you the woman's pig for amusement?"</p>

<p>The man answered sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nought else, good sir&mdash;I tell thee 'twas but a jest."</p>

<p>"I do begin to believe thee," said Hendon, with a perplexing mixture of
mockery and half-conviction in his tone; "but tarry thou here a moment
whilst I run and ask his worship&mdash;for nathless, he being a man
experienced in law, in jests, in&mdash;"</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>He was moving away, still talking; the constable hesitated, fidgeted,
spat out an oath or two, then cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold, hold, good sir&mdash;prithee wait a little&mdash;the judge! &nbsp;Why, man, he
hath no more sympathy with a jest than hath a dead corpse!&mdash;come, and we
will speak further. &nbsp;Ods body! &nbsp;I seem to be in evil case&mdash;and all for an
innocent and thoughtless pleasantry. I am a man of family; and my wife
and little ones&mdash;List to reason, good your worship: what wouldst thou
of me?"</p>

<p>"Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may count a
hundred thousand&mdash;counting slowly," said Hendon, with the expression of a
man who asks but a reasonable favour, and that a very little one.</p>

<p>"It is my destruction!" said the constable despairingly. &nbsp;"Ah, be
reasonable, good sir; only look at this matter, on all its sides, and see
how mere a jest it is&mdash;how manifestly and how plainly it is so. &nbsp;And even
if one granted it were not a jest, it is a fault so small that e'en the
grimmest penalty it could call forth would be but a rebuke and warning
from the judge's lips."</p>

<p>Hendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about him&mdash;</p>

<p>"This jest of thine hath a name, in law,&mdash;wot you what it is?"</p>

<p>"I knew it not! &nbsp;Peradventure I have been unwise. &nbsp;I never dreamed it had
a name&mdash;ah, sweet heaven, I thought it was original."</p>

<p>"Yes, it hath a name. &nbsp;In the law this crime is called Non compos mentis
lex talionis sic transit gloria mundi."</p>

<p>"Ah, my God!"</p>

<p>"And the penalty is death!"</p>

<p>"God be merciful to me a sinner!"</p>

<p>"By advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy mercy,
thou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha'penny, paying but a
trifle for the same; and this, in the eye of the law, is constructive
barratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in office, ad hominem
expurgatis in statu quo&mdash;and the penalty is death by the halter, without
ransom, commutation, or benefit of clergy."</p>

<p>"Bear me up, bear me up, sweet sir, my legs do fail me! &nbsp;Be thou
merciful&mdash;spare me this doom, and I will turn my back and see nought that
shall happen."</p>

<br><br><br><br>


<p>"Good! now thou'rt wise and reasonable. &nbsp;And thou'lt restore the pig?"</p>

<p>"I will, I will indeed&mdash;nor ever touch another, though heaven send it and
an archangel fetch it. &nbsp;Go&mdash;I am blind for thy sake&mdash;I see nothing. &nbsp;I
will say thou didst break in and wrest the prisoner from my hands by
force. &nbsp;It is but a crazy, ancient door&mdash;I will batter it down myself
betwixt midnight and the morning."</p>

<p>"Do it, good soul, no harm will come of it; the judge hath a loving
charity for this poor lad, and will shed no tears and break no jailer's
bones for his escape."</p>

<p>Chapter XXV. Hendon Hall.</p>

<p>As soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the constable, his
Majesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place outside the town, and
wait there, whilst Hendon should go to the inn and settle his account.
Half an hour later the two friends were blithely jogging eastward on
Hendon's sorry steeds. &nbsp;The King was warm and comfortable, now, for he
had cast his rags and clothed himself in the second-hand suit which
Hendon had bought on London Bridge.</p>


<br><br>
<a name="25-296"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="25-296.jpg (148K)" src="images/25-296.jpg" height="833" width="722">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>Hendon wished to guard against over-fatiguing the boy; he judged that
hard journeys, irregular meals, and illiberal measures of sleep would be
bad for his crazed mind; whilst rest, regularity, and moderate exercise
would be pretty sure to hasten its cure; he longed to see the stricken
intellect made well again and its diseased visions driven out of the
tormented little head; therefore he resolved to move by easy stages
toward the home whence he had so long been banished, instead of obeying
the impulse of his impatience and hurrying along night and day.</p>

<p>When he and the King had journeyed about ten miles, they reached a
considerable village, and halted there for the night, at a good inn. &nbsp;The
former relations were resumed; Hendon stood behind the King's chair,
while he dined, and waited upon him; undressed him when he was ready for
bed; then took the floor for his own quarters, and slept athwart the
door, rolled up in a blanket.</p>

<p>The next day, and the day after, they jogged lazily along talking over
the adventures they had met since their separation, and mightily enjoying
each other's narratives. &nbsp;Hendon detailed all his wide wanderings in
search of the King, and described how the archangel had led him a fool's
journey all over the forest, and taken him back to the hut, finally, when
he found he could not get rid of him. &nbsp;Then&mdash;he said&mdash;the old man went
into the bedchamber and came staggering back looking broken-hearted, and
saying he had expected to find that the boy had returned and laid down in
there to rest, but it was not so. &nbsp;Hendon had waited at the hut all day;
hope of the King's return died out, then, and he departed upon the quest
again.</p>

<p>"And old Sanctum Sanctorum WAS truly sorry your highness came not back,"
said Hendon; "I saw it in his face."</p>

<p>"Marry I will never doubt THAT!" said the King&mdash;and then told his own
story; after which, Hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the archangel.</p>

<p>During the last day of the trip, Hendon's spirits were soaring. His
tongue ran constantly. &nbsp;He talked about his old father, and his brother
Arthur, and told of many things which illustrated their high and generous
characters; he went into loving frenzies over his Edith, and was so
glad-hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and brotherly things
about Hugh. &nbsp;He dwelt a deal on the coming meeting at Hendon Hall; what a
surprise it would be to everybody, and what an outburst of thanksgiving
and delight there would be.</p>

<p>It was a fair region, dotted with cottages and orchards, and the road led
through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses, marked with gentle
elevations and depressions, suggested the swelling and subsiding
undulations of the sea. &nbsp;In the afternoon the returning prodigal made
constant deflections from his course to see if by ascending some hillock
he might not pierce the distance and catch a glimpse of his home. &nbsp;At
last he was successful, and cried out excitedly&mdash;</p>

<br><br>
<a name="25-297"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="25-297.jpg (108K)" src="images/25-297.jpg" height="623" width="717">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"There is the village, my Prince, and there is the Hall close by! You may
see the towers from here; and that wood there&mdash;that is my father's park.
Ah, NOW thou'lt know what state and grandeur be! A house with seventy
rooms&mdash;think of that!&mdash;and seven and twenty servants! &nbsp;A brave lodging
for such as we, is it not so? &nbsp;Come, let us speed&mdash;my impatience will not
brook further delay."</p>

<p>All possible hurry was made; still, it was after three o'clock before the
village was reached. &nbsp;The travellers scampered through it, Hendon's
tongue going all the time. &nbsp;"Here is the church&mdash;covered with the same
ivy&mdash;none gone, none added." &nbsp;"Yonder is the inn, the old Red Lion,&mdash;and
yonder is the market-place." &nbsp;"Here is the Maypole, and here the
pump&mdash;nothing is altered; nothing but the people, at any rate; ten years make a
change in people; some of these I seem to know, but none know me." &nbsp;So
his chat ran on. The end of the village was soon reached; then the
travellers struck into a crooked, narrow road, walled in with tall
hedges, and hurried briskly along it for half a mile, then passed into a
vast flower garden through an imposing gateway, whose huge stone pillars
bore sculptured armorial devices. &nbsp;A noble mansion was before them.</p>

<p>"Welcome to Hendon Hall, my King!" exclaimed Miles. &nbsp;"Ah, 'tis a great
day! &nbsp;My father and my brother, and the Lady Edith will be so mad with
joy that they will have eyes and tongue for none but me in the first
transports of the meeting, and so thou'lt seem but coldly welcomed&mdash;but
mind it not; 'twill soon seem otherwise; for when I say thou art my ward,
and tell them how costly is my love for thee, thou'lt see them take thee
to their breasts for Miles Hendon's sake, and make their house and hearts
thy home for ever after!"</p>

<p>The next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great door, helped
the King down, then took him by the hand and rushed within. A few steps
brought him to a spacious apartment; he entered, seated the King with
more hurry than ceremony, then ran toward a young man who sat at a
writing-table in front of a generous fire of logs.</p>

<br><br><br><br>


<p>"Embrace me, Hugh," he cried, "and say thou'rt glad I am come again! and
call our father, for home is not home till I shall touch his hand, and
see his face, and hear his voice once more!"</p>

<p>But Hugh only drew back, after betraying a momentary surprise, and bent a
grave stare upon the intruder&mdash;a stare which indicated somewhat of
offended dignity, at first, then changed, in response to some inward
thought or purpose, to an expression of marvelling curiosity, mixed with
a real or assumed compassion. &nbsp;Presently he said, in a mild voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thy wits seem touched, poor stranger; doubtless thou hast suffered
privations and rude buffetings at the world's hands; thy looks and dress
betoken it. &nbsp;Whom dost thou take me to be?"</p>

<p>"Take thee? &nbsp;Prithee for whom else than whom thou art? &nbsp;I take thee to be
Hugh Hendon," said Miles, sharply.</p>

<p>The other continued, in the same soft tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"And whom dost thou imagine thyself to be?"</p>

<p>"Imagination hath nought to do with it! &nbsp;Dost thou pretend thou knowest
me not for thy brother Miles Hendon?"</p>

<p>An expression of pleased surprise flitted across Hugh's face, and he
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"What! thou art not jesting? can the dead come to life? &nbsp;God be praised
if it be so! &nbsp;Our poor lost boy restored to our arms after all these
cruel years! &nbsp;Ah, it seems too good to be true, it IS too good to be
true&mdash;I charge thee, have pity, do not trifle with me! &nbsp;Quick&mdash;come to
the light&mdash;let me scan thee well!"</p>

<p>He seized Miles by the arm, dragged him to the window, and began to
devour him from head to foot with his eyes, turning him this way and
that, and stepping briskly around him and about him to prove him from all
points of view; whilst the returned prodigal, all aglow with gladness,
smiled, laughed, and kept nodding his head and saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on, brother, go on, and fear not; thou'lt find nor limb nor feature
that cannot bide the test. &nbsp;Scour and scan me to thy content, my good old
Hugh&mdash;I am indeed thy old Miles, thy same old Miles, thy lost brother,
is't not so? &nbsp;Ah, 'tis a great day&mdash;I SAID 'twas a great day! &nbsp;Give me
thy hand, give me thy cheek&mdash;lord, I am like to die of very joy!"</p>

<p>He was about to throw himself upon his brother; but Hugh put up his hand
in dissent, then dropped his chin mournfully upon his breast, saying with
emotion&mdash;</p>

<br><br>
<a name="25-301"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="25-301.jpg (97K)" src="images/25-301.jpg" height="505" width="733">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Ah, God of his mercy give me strength to bear this grievous
disappointment!"</p>

<p>Miles, amazed, could not speak for a moment; then he found his tongue,
and cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"WHAT disappointment? &nbsp;Am I not thy brother?"</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head sadly, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I pray heaven it may prove so, and that other eyes may find the
resemblances that are hid from mine. &nbsp;Alack, I fear me the letter spoke
but too truly."</p>

<p>"What letter?"</p>

<p>"One that came from over sea, some six or seven years ago. &nbsp;It said my
brother died in battle."</p>

<p>"It was a lie! &nbsp;Call thy father&mdash;he will know me."</p>

<p>"One may not call the dead."</p>

<p>"Dead?" Miles's voice was subdued, and his lips trembled. &nbsp;"My father
dead!&mdash;oh, this is heavy news. &nbsp;Half my new joy is withered now. &nbsp;Prithee
let me see my brother Arthur&mdash;he will know me; he will know me and
console me."</p>

<p>"He, also, is dead."</p>

<p>"God be merciful to me, a stricken man! &nbsp;Gone,&mdash;both gone&mdash;the worthy
taken and the worthless spared, in me! &nbsp;Ah! I crave your mercy!&mdash;do not
say the Lady Edith&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is dead? &nbsp;No, she lives."</p>

<p>"Then, God be praised, my joy is whole again! &nbsp;Speed thee, brother&mdash;let
her come to me! &nbsp;An' SHE say I am not myself&mdash;but she will not; no, no,
SHE will know me, I were a fool to doubt it. Bring her&mdash;bring the old
servants; they, too, will know me."</p>

<p>"All are gone but five&mdash;Peter, Halsey, David, Bernard, and Margaret."</p>

<p>So saying, Hugh left the room. &nbsp;Miles stood musing a while, then began to
walk the floor, muttering&mdash;</p>

<p>"The five arch-villains have survived the two-and-twenty leal and
honest&mdash;'tis an odd thing."</p>

<p>He continued walking back and forth, muttering to himself; he had
forgotten the King entirely. &nbsp;By-and-by his Majesty said gravely, and
with a touch of genuine compassion, though the words themselves were
capable of being interpreted ironically&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mind not thy mischance, good man; there be others in the world whose
identity is denied, and whose claims are derided. &nbsp;Thou hast company."</p>

<p>"Ah, my King," cried Hendon, colouring slightly, "do not thou condemn
me&mdash;wait, and thou shalt see. &nbsp;I am no impostor&mdash;she will say it; you shall
hear it from the sweetest lips in England. &nbsp;I an impostor? &nbsp;Why, I know
this old hall, these pictures of my ancestors, and all these things that
are about us, as a child knoweth its own nursery. &nbsp;Here was I born and
bred, my lord; I speak the truth; I would not deceive thee; and should
none else believe, I pray thee do not THOU doubt me&mdash;I could not bear
it."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt thee," said the King, with a childlike simplicity and
faith.</p>

<p>"I thank thee out of my heart!" exclaimed Hendon with a fervency which
showed that he was touched. &nbsp;The King added, with the same gentle
simplicity&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dost thou doubt ME?"</p>

<p>A guilty confusion seized upon Hendon, and he was grateful that the door
opened to admit Hugh, at that moment, and saved him the necessity of
replying.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>A beautiful lady, richly clothed, followed Hugh, and after her came
several liveried servants. &nbsp;The lady walked slowly, with her head bowed
and her eyes fixed upon the floor. &nbsp;The face was unspeakably sad. &nbsp;Miles
Hendon sprang forward, crying out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my Edith, my darling&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Hugh waved him back, gravely, and said to the lady&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look upon him. &nbsp;Do you know him?"</p>

<p>At the sound of Miles's voice the woman had started slightly, and her
cheeks had flushed; she was trembling now. &nbsp;She stood still, during an
impressive pause of several moments; then slowly lifted up her head and
looked into Hendon's eyes with a stony and frightened gaze; the blood
sank out of her face, drop by drop, till nothing remained but the grey
pallor of death; then she said, in a voice as dead as the face, "I know
him not!" and turned, with a moan and a stifled sob, and tottered out of
the room.</p>

<p>Miles Hendon sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands.
After a pause, his brother said to the servants&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have observed him. &nbsp;Do you know him?"</p>

<p>They shook their heads; then the master said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The servants know you not, sir. &nbsp;I fear there is some mistake. You have
seen that my wife knew you not."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="25-305"></a>
<br><br>

<img alt="25-305.jpg (121K)" src="images/25-305.jpg" height="699" width="727">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Thy WIFE!" &nbsp;In an instant Hugh was pinned to the wall, with an iron grip
about his throat. &nbsp;"Oh, thou fox-hearted slave, I see it all! &nbsp;Thou'st
writ the lying letter thyself, and my stolen bride and goods are its
fruit. &nbsp;There&mdash;now get thee gone, lest I shame mine honourable
soldiership with the slaying of so pitiful a mannikin!"</p>

<p>Hugh, red-faced, and almost suffocated, reeled to the nearest chair, and
commanded the servants to seize and bind the murderous stranger. &nbsp;They
hesitated, and one of them said&mdash;</p>

<p>"He is armed, Sir Hugh, and we are weaponless."</p>

<p>"Armed! &nbsp;What of it, and ye so many? &nbsp;Upon him, I say!"</p>

<p>But Miles warned them to be careful what they did, and added&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye know me of old&mdash;I have not changed; come on, an' it like you."</p>

<p>This reminder did not hearten the servants much; they still held back.</p>

<p>"Then go, ye paltry cowards, and arm yourselves and guard the doors,
whilst I send one to fetch the watch!" said Hugh. &nbsp;He turned at the
threshold, and said to Miles, "You'll find it to your advantage to offend
not with useless endeavours at escape."</p>

<p>"Escape? &nbsp;Spare thyself discomfort, an' that is all that troubles thee.
For Miles Hendon is master of Hendon Hall and all its belongings. &nbsp;He
will remain&mdash;doubt it not."</p>

<p>Chapter XXVI. Disowned.</p>

<p>The King sat musing a few moments, then looked up and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis strange&mdash;most strange. &nbsp;I cannot account for it."</p>

<p>"No, it is not strange, my liege. &nbsp;I know him, and this conduct is but
natural. &nbsp;He was a rascal from his birth."</p>

<p>"Oh, I spake not of HIM, Sir Miles."</p>

<p>"Not of him? &nbsp;Then of what? &nbsp;What is it that is strange?"</p>

<p>"That the King is not missed."</p>

<p>"How? &nbsp;Which? &nbsp;I doubt I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Indeed? &nbsp;Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land
is not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and
making search for me? &nbsp;Is it no matter for commotion and distress that
the Head of the State is gone; that I am vanished away and lost?"</p>

<p>"Most true, my King, I had forgot." &nbsp;Then Hendon sighed, and muttered to
himself, "Poor ruined mind&mdash;still busy with its pathetic dream."</p>

<p>"But I have a plan that shall right us both&mdash;I will write a paper, in
three tongues&mdash;Latin, Greek and English&mdash;and thou shalt haste away with
it to London in the morning. &nbsp;Give it to none but my uncle, the Lord
Hertford; when he shall see it, he will know and say I wrote it. &nbsp;Then he
will send for me."</p>

<p>"Might it not be best, my Prince, that we wait here until I prove myself
and make my rights secure to my domains? &nbsp;I should be so much the better
able then to&mdash;"</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>The King interrupted him imperiously&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peace! &nbsp;What are thy paltry domains, thy trivial interests, contrasted
with matters which concern the weal of a nation and the integrity of a
throne?" &nbsp;Then, he added, in a gentle voice, as if he were sorry for his
severity, "Obey, and have no fear; I will right thee, I will make thee
whole&mdash;yes, more than whole. &nbsp;I shall remember, and requite."</p>

<p>So saying, he took the pen, and set himself to work. &nbsp;Hendon contemplated
him lovingly a while, then said to himself&mdash;</p>

<p>"An' it were dark, I should think it WAS a king that spoke; there's no
denying it, when the humour's upon on him he doth thunder and lighten
like your true King; now where got he that trick? &nbsp;See him scribble and
scratch away contentedly at his meaningless pot-hooks, fancying them to
be Latin and Greek&mdash;and except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device
for diverting him from his purpose, I shall be forced to pretend to post
away to-morrow on this wild errand he hath invented for me."</p>

<p>The next moment Sir Miles's thoughts had gone back to the recent episode.
So absorbed was he in his musings, that when the King presently handed
him the paper which he had been writing, he received it and pocketed it
without being conscious of the act. "How marvellous strange she acted,"
he muttered. &nbsp;"I think she knew me&mdash;and I think she did NOT know me.
These opinions do conflict, I perceive it plainly; I cannot reconcile
them, neither can I, by argument, dismiss either of the two, or even
persuade one to outweigh the other. &nbsp;The matter standeth simply thus:
she MUST have known my face, my figure, my voice, for how could it be
otherwise? &nbsp;Yet she SAID she knew me not, and that is proof perfect, for
she cannot lie. &nbsp;But stop&mdash;I think I begin to see. Peradventure he hath
influenced her, commanded her, compelled her to lie. &nbsp;That is the
solution. &nbsp;The riddle is unriddled. &nbsp;She seemed dead with fear&mdash;yes, she
was under his compulsion. &nbsp;I will seek her; I will find her; now that he
is away, she will speak her true mind. &nbsp;She will remember the old times
when we were little playfellows together, and this will soften her heart,
and she will no more betray me, but will confess me. &nbsp;There is no
treacherous blood in her&mdash;no, she was always honest and true. &nbsp;She has
loved me, in those old days&mdash;this is my security; for whom one has loved,
one cannot betray."</p>

<p>He stepped eagerly toward the door; at that moment it opened, and the
Lady Edith entered. &nbsp;She was very pale, but she walked with a firm step,
and her carriage was full of grace and gentle dignity. Her face was as
sad as before.</p>

<p>Miles sprang forward, with a happy confidence, to meet her, but she
checked him with a hardly perceptible gesture, and he stopped where he
was. &nbsp;She seated herself, and asked him to do likewise. Thus simply did
she take the sense of old comradeship out of him, and transform him into
a stranger and a guest. &nbsp;The surprise of it, the bewildering
unexpectedness of it, made him begin to question, for a moment, if he WAS
the person he was pretending to be, after all. &nbsp;The Lady Edith said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir, I have come to warn you. &nbsp;The mad cannot be persuaded out of their
delusions, perchance; but doubtless they may be persuaded to avoid
perils. &nbsp;I think this dream of yours hath the seeming of honest truth to
you, and therefore is not criminal&mdash;but do not tarry here with it; for
here it is dangerous." &nbsp;She looked steadily into Miles's face a moment,
then added, impressively, "It is the more dangerous for that you ARE much
like what our lost lad must have grown to be if he had lived."</p>

<p>"Heavens, madam, but I AM he!"</p>

<p>"I truly think you think it, sir. &nbsp;I question not your honesty in that; I
but warn you, that is all. &nbsp;My husband is master in this region; his
power hath hardly any limit; the people prosper or starve, as he wills.
If you resembled not the man whom you profess to be, my husband might bid
you pleasure yourself with your dream in peace; but trust me, I know him
well; I know what he will do; he will say to all that you are but a mad
impostor, and straightway all will echo him." &nbsp;She bent upon Miles that
same steady look once more, and added: &nbsp;"If you WERE Miles Hendon, and he
knew it and all the region knew it&mdash;consider what I am saying, weigh it
well&mdash;you would stand in the same peril, your punishment would be no less
sure; he would deny you and denounce you, and none would be bold enough
to give you countenance."</p>

<p>"Most truly I believe it," said Miles, bitterly. &nbsp;"The power that can
command one life-long friend to betray and disown another, and be obeyed,
may well look to be obeyed in quarters where bread and life are on the
stake and no cobweb ties of loyalty and honour are concerned."</p>

<p>A faint tinge appeared for a moment in the lady's cheek, and she dropped
her eyes to the floor; but her voice betrayed no emotion when she
proceeded&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have warned you&mdash;I must still warn you&mdash;to go hence. &nbsp;This man will
destroy you, else. &nbsp;He is a tyrant who knows no pity. &nbsp;I, who am his
fettered slave, know this. &nbsp;Poor Miles, and Arthur, and my dear guardian,
Sir Richard, are free of him, and at rest: &nbsp;better that you were with
them than that you bide here in the clutches of this miscreant. &nbsp;Your
pretensions are a menace to his title and possessions; you have assaulted
him in his own house: &nbsp;you are ruined if you stay. &nbsp;Go&mdash;do not hesitate.
If you lack money, take this purse, I beg of you, and bribe the servants
to let you pass. Oh, be warned, poor soul, and escape while you may."</p>

<p>Miles declined the purse with a gesture, and rose up and stood before
her.</p>

<p>"Grant me one thing," he said. &nbsp;"Let your eyes rest upon mine, so that I
may see if they be steady. &nbsp;There&mdash;now answer me. &nbsp;Am I Miles Hendon?"</p>


<p>"No. &nbsp;I know you not."</p>

<p>"Swear it!"</p>

<p>The answer was low, but distinct&mdash;</p>

<p>"I swear."</p>

<p>"Oh, this passes belief!"</p>

<p>"Fly! &nbsp;Why will you waste the precious time? &nbsp;Fly, and save yourself."</p>

<p>At that moment the officers burst into the room, and a violent struggle
began; but Hendon was soon overpowered and dragged away. The King was
taken also, and both were bound and led to prison.</p>
