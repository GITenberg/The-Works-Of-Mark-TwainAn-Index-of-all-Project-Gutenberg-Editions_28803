<p>Chapter I. The birth of the Prince and the Pauper.</p>

<p>In the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second
quarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the
name of Canty, who did not want him. &nbsp;On the same day another English
child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him.
All England wanted him too. &nbsp;England had so longed for him, and hoped for
him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the
people went nearly mad for joy. &nbsp;Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed
each other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich
and poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they kept
this up for days and nights together. &nbsp;By day, London was a sight to see,
with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and splendid
pageants marching along. &nbsp;By night, it was again a sight to see, with its
great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of revellers making merry
around them. &nbsp;There was no talk in all England but of the new baby,
Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in silks and satins,
unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that great lords and ladies
were tending him and watching over him&mdash;and not caring, either. &nbsp;But
there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty, lapped in his poor
rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had just come to trouble
with his presence.</p>

<p>Chapter II. Tom's early life.</p>

<p>Let us skip a number of years.</p>

<p>London was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town&mdash;for that day.
It had a hundred thousand inhabitants&mdash;some think double as many. &nbsp;The
streets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the part
where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge. &nbsp;The houses
were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first, and the
third sticking its elbows out beyond the second. &nbsp;The higher the houses
grew, the broader they grew. &nbsp;They were skeletons of strong criss-cross
beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster. &nbsp;The beams were
painted red or blue or black, according to the owner's taste, and this
gave the houses a very picturesque look. &nbsp;The windows were small, glazed
with little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened outward, on hinges,
like doors.</p>

<p>The house which Tom's father lived in was up a foul little pocket called
Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane. &nbsp;It was small, decayed, and rickety,
but it was packed full of wretchedly poor families. Canty's tribe
occupied a room on the third floor. &nbsp;The mother and father had a sort of
bedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters,
Bet and Nan, were not restricted&mdash;they had all the floor to themselves,
and might sleep where they chose. &nbsp;There were the remains of a blanket or
two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not
rightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they were kicked
into a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at
night, for service.</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="02-028.jpg (94K)" src="images/02-028.jpg" height="855" width="443">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Bet and Nan were fifteen years old&mdash;twins. &nbsp;They were good-hearted girls,
unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant. &nbsp;Their mother was like
them. &nbsp;But the father and the grandmother were a couple of fiends. &nbsp;They
got drunk whenever they could; then they fought each other or anybody
else who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk or sober;
John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar. &nbsp;They made beggars of
the children, but failed to make thieves of them. &nbsp;Among, but not of, the
dreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old priest whom the
King had turned out of house and home with a pension of a few farthings,
and he used to get the children aside and teach them right ways secretly.
Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and how to read and write;
and would have done the same with the girls, but they were afraid of the
jeers of their friends, who could not have endured such a queer
accomplishment in them.</p>

<p>All Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty's house. Drunkenness,
riot and brawling were the order, there, every night and nearly all night
long. &nbsp;Broken heads were as common as hunger in that place. &nbsp;Yet little
Tom was not unhappy. &nbsp;He had a hard time of it, but did not know it. &nbsp;It
was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys had, therefore he
supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing. &nbsp;When he came home
empty-handed at night, he knew his father would curse him and thrash him
first, and that when he was done the awful grandmother would do it all
over again and improve on it; and that away in the night his starving
mother would slip to him stealthily with any miserable scrap or crust she
had been able to save for him by going hungry herself, notwithstanding
she was often caught in that sort of treason and soundly beaten for it by
her husband.</p>

<p>No, Tom's life went along well enough, especially in summer. &nbsp;He only
begged just enough to save himself, for the laws against mendicancy were
stringent, and the penalties heavy; so he put in a good deal of his time
listening to good Father Andrew's charming old tales and legends about
giants and fairies, dwarfs and genii, and enchanted castles, and gorgeous
kings and princes. &nbsp;His head grew to be full of these wonderful things,
and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and offensive straw,
tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he unleashed his
imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in delicious picturings
to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince in a regal palace. &nbsp;One
desire came in time to haunt him day and night: &nbsp;it was to see a real
prince, with his own eyes. &nbsp;He spoke of it once to some of his Offal
Court comrades; but they jeered him and scoffed him so unmercifully that
he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that.</p>

<p>He often read the priest's old books and got him to explain and enlarge
upon them. &nbsp;His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him, by-
and-by. &nbsp;His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his shabby
clothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad. &nbsp;He went
on playing in the mud just the same, and enjoying it, too; but, instead
of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it, he began to
find an added value in it because of the washings and cleansings it
afforded.</p>

<p>Tom could always find something going on around the Maypole in Cheapside,
and at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of London had a chance
to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was carried
prisoner to the Tower, by land or boat. One summer's day he saw poor Anne
Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and heard an ex-
Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him. &nbsp;Yes, Tom's
life was varied and pleasant enough, on the whole.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>By-and-by Tom's reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a
strong effect upon him that he began to ACT the prince, unconsciously.
His speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly, to the
vast admiration and amusement of his intimates. &nbsp;But Tom's influence
among these young people began to grow now, day by day; and in time he
came to be looked up to, by them, with a sort of wondering awe, as a
superior being. &nbsp;He seemed to know so much! and he could do and say such
marvellous things! and withal, he was so deep and wise! &nbsp;Tom's remarks,
and Tom's performances, were reported by the boys to their elders; and
these, also, presently began to discuss Tom Canty, and to regard him as a
most gifted and extraordinary creature. &nbsp;Full-grown people brought their
perplexities to Tom for solution, and were often astonished at the wit
and wisdom of his decisions. &nbsp;In fact he was become a hero to all who
knew him except his own family&mdash;these, only, saw nothing in him.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Privately, after a while, Tom organised a royal court! &nbsp;He was the
prince; his special comrades were guards, chamberlains, equerries, lords
and ladies in waiting, and the royal family. &nbsp;Daily the mock prince was
received with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic
readings; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed in
the royal council, and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his
imaginary armies, navies, and viceroyalties.</p>

<p>After which, he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings, eat
his poor crust, take his customary cuffs and abuse, and then stretch
himself upon his handful of foul straw, and resume his empty grandeurs in
his dreams.</p>

<p>And still his desire to look just once upon a real prince, in the flesh,
grew upon him, day by day, and week by week, until at last it absorbed
all other desires, and became the one passion of his life.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>One January day, on his usual begging tour, he tramped despondently up
and down the region round about Mincing Lane and Little East Cheap, hour
after hour, bare-footed and cold, looking in at cook-shop windows and
longing for the dreadful pork-pies and other deadly inventions displayed
there&mdash;for to him these were dainties fit for the angels; that is,
judging by the smell, they were&mdash;for it had never been his good luck to
own and eat one. There was a cold drizzle of rain; the atmosphere was
murky; it was a melancholy day. &nbsp;At night Tom reached home so wet and
tired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother
to observe his forlorn condition and not be moved&mdash;after their fashion;
wherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed. &nbsp;For
a long time his pain and hunger, and the swearing and fighting going on
in the building, kept him awake; but at last his thoughts drifted away to
far, romantic lands, and he fell asleep in the company of jewelled and
gilded princelings who live in vast palaces, and had servants salaaming
before them or flying to execute their orders. &nbsp;And then, as usual, he
dreamed that HE was a princeling himself.</p>

<p>All night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him; he moved
among great lords and ladies, in a blaze of light, breathing perfumes,
drinking in delicious music, and answering the reverent obeisances of the
glittering throng as it parted to make way for him, with here a smile,
and there a nod of his princely head.</p>

<p>And when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness about
him, his dream had had its usual effect&mdash;it had intensified the
sordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold. &nbsp;Then came bitterness, and
heart-break, and tears.</p>

<p>Chapter III. Tom's meeting with the Prince.</p>

<p>Tom got up hungry, and sauntered hungry away, but with his thoughts busy
with the shadowy splendours of his night's dreams. He wandered here and
there in the city, hardly noticing where he was going, or what was
happening around him. &nbsp;People jostled him, and some gave him rough
speech; but it was all lost on the musing boy. &nbsp;By-and-by he found
himself at Temple Bar, the farthest from home he had ever travelled in
that direction. &nbsp;He stopped and considered a moment, then fell into his
imaginings again, and passed on outside the walls of London. &nbsp;The Strand
had ceased to be a country-road then, and regarded itself as a street,
but by a strained construction; for, though there was a tolerably compact
row of houses on one side of it, there were only some scattered great
buildings on the other, these being palaces of rich nobles, with ample
and beautiful grounds stretching to the river&mdash;grounds that are now
closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone.</p>

<p>Tom discovered Charing Village presently, and rested himself at the
beautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days; then
idled down a quiet, lovely road, past the great cardinal's stately
palace, toward a far more mighty and majestic palace beyond&mdash;Westminster.
Tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of masonry, the wide-spreading
wings, the frowning bastions and turrets, the huge stone gateway, with
its gilded bars and its magnificent array of colossal granite lions, and
other the signs and symbols of English royalty. &nbsp;Was the desire of his
soul to be satisfied at last? &nbsp;Here, indeed, was a king's palace. &nbsp;Might
he not hope to see a prince now&mdash;a prince of flesh and blood, if Heaven
were willing?</p>

<p>At each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue&mdash;that is to say, an
erect and stately and motionless man-at-arms, clad from head to heel in
shining steel armour. &nbsp;At a respectful distance were many country folk,
and people from the city, waiting for any chance glimpse of royalty that
might offer. &nbsp;Splendid carriages, with splendid people in them and
splendid servants outside, were arriving and departing by several other
noble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure.</p>

<p>Poor little Tom, in his rags, approached, and was moving slowly and
timidly past the sentinels, with a beating heart and a rising hope, when
all at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that
almost made him shout for joy. &nbsp;Within was a comely boy, tanned and brown
with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises, whose clothing was all of
lovely silks and satins, shining with jewels; at his hip a little
jewelled sword and dagger; dainty buskins on his feet, with red heels;
and on his head a jaunty crimson cap, with drooping plumes fastened with
a great sparkling gem. &nbsp;Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near&mdash;his
servants, without a doubt. &nbsp;Oh! he was a prince&mdash;a prince, a living
prince, a real prince&mdash;without the shadow of a question; and the prayer
of the pauper-boy's heart was answered at last.</p>

<p>Tom's breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes grew big
with wonder and delight. &nbsp;Everything gave way in his mind instantly to
one desire: &nbsp;that was to get close to the prince, and have a good,
devouring look at him. &nbsp;Before he knew what he was about, he had his face
against the gate-bars. &nbsp;The next instant one of the soldiers snatched him
rudely away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd of country
gawks and London idlers. &nbsp;The soldier said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mind thy manners, thou young beggar!"</p>

<p>The crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the gate
with his face flushed, and his eyes flashing with indignation, and cried
out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How dar'st thou use a poor lad like that? &nbsp;How dar'st thou use the King
my father's meanest subject so? &nbsp;Open the gates, and let him in!"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="03-039"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="03-039.jpg (171K)" src="images/03-039.jpg" height="1055" width="741">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>You should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then. You
should have heard them cheer, and shout, "Long live the Prince of Wales!"</p>

<p>The soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the gates, and
presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in, in his
fluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty.</p>

<p>Edward Tudor said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou lookest tired and hungry: &nbsp;thou'st been treated ill. &nbsp;Come with
me."</p>

<p>Half a dozen attendants sprang forward to&mdash;I don't know what; interfere,
no doubt. &nbsp;But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture, and they
stopped stock still where they were, like so many statues. &nbsp;Edward took
Tom to a rich apartment in the palace, which he called his cabinet. &nbsp;By
his command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered before
except in books. &nbsp;The prince, with princely delicacy and breeding, sent
away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be embarrassed by
their critical presence; then he sat near by, and asked questions while
Tom ate.</p>

<p>"What is thy name, lad?"</p>

<p>"Tom Canty, an' it please thee, sir."</p>

<p>"'Tis an odd one. &nbsp;Where dost live?"</p>

<p>"In the city, please thee, sir. &nbsp;Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane."</p>

<p>"Offal Court! &nbsp;Truly 'tis another odd one. &nbsp;Hast parents?"</p>

<p>"Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently
precious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to say it&mdash;also twin
sisters, Nan and Bet."</p>

<p>"Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?"</p>

<p>"Neither to any other is she, so please your worship. &nbsp;She hath a wicked
heart, and worketh evil all her days."</p>

<p>"Doth she mistreat thee?"</p>

<p>"There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or overcome with
drink; but when she hath her judgment clear again, she maketh it up to me
with goodly beatings."</p>

<p>A fierce look came into the little prince's eyes, and he cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"What! &nbsp;Beatings?"</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir."</p>

<p>"BEATINGS!&mdash;and thou so frail and little. &nbsp;Hark ye: &nbsp;before the night
come, she shall hie her to the Tower. &nbsp;The King my father"&mdash;</p>

<p>"In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree. &nbsp;The Tower is for the great
alone."</p>

<p>"True, indeed. &nbsp;I had not thought of that. &nbsp;I will consider of her
punishment. &nbsp;Is thy father kind to thee?"</p>

<p>"Not more than Gammer Canty, sir."</p>

<p>"Fathers be alike, mayhap. &nbsp;Mine hath not a doll's temper. &nbsp;He smiteth
with a heavy hand, yet spareth me: &nbsp;he spareth me not always with his
tongue, though, sooth to say. &nbsp;How doth thy mother use thee?"</p>

<p>"She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort.
And Nan and Bet are like to her in this."</p>

<p>"How old be these?"</p>

<p>"Fifteen, an' it please you, sir."</p>

<p>"The Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey, my
cousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious withal; but my sister
the Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and&mdash;Look you: &nbsp;do thy sisters forbid
their servants to smile, lest the sin destroy their souls?"</p>

<p>"They? &nbsp;Oh, dost think, sir, that THEY have servants?"</p>

<p>The little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"And prithee, why not? &nbsp;Who helpeth them undress at night? &nbsp;Who attireth
them when they rise?"</p>

<p>"None, sir. &nbsp;Would'st have them take off their garment, and sleep
without&mdash;like the beasts?"</p>

<p>"Their garment! &nbsp;Have they but one?"</p>

<p>"Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more? &nbsp;Truly they have
not two bodies each."</p>

<p>"It is a quaint and marvellous thought! &nbsp;Thy pardon, I had not meant to
laugh. &nbsp;But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys enow,
and that soon, too: &nbsp;my cofferer shall look to it. &nbsp;No, thank me not;
'tis nothing. &nbsp;Thou speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it. &nbsp;Art
learned?"</p>

<p>"I know not if I am or not, sir. &nbsp;The good priest that is called Father
Andrew taught me, of his kindness, from his books."</p>

<p>"Know'st thou the Latin?"</p>

<p>"But scantly, sir, I doubt."</p>

<p>"Learn it, lad: &nbsp;'tis hard only at first. &nbsp;The Greek is harder; but
neither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the Lady
Elizabeth and my cousin. &nbsp;Thou should'st hear those damsels at it! &nbsp;But
tell me of thy Offal Court. &nbsp;Hast thou a pleasant life there?"</p>

<p>"In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry. There be
Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys&mdash;oh such antic creatures! and so
bravely dressed!&mdash;and there be plays wherein they that play do shout and
fight till all are slain, and 'tis so fine to see, and costeth but a
farthing&mdash;albeit 'tis main hard to get the farthing, please your
worship."</p>

<p>"Tell me more."</p>

<p>"We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel,
like to the fashion of the 'prentices, sometimes."</p>

<p>The prince's eyes flashed. &nbsp;Said he&mdash;</p>

<p>"Marry, that would not I mislike. &nbsp;Tell me more."</p>

<p>"We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest."</p>

<p>"That would I like also. &nbsp;Speak on."</p>

<p>"In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and
each doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with water, and dive and
shout and tumble and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Twould be worth my father's kingdom but to enjoy it once! Prithee go
on."</p>

<p>"We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand,
each covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud pastry&mdash;oh the
lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the world!&mdash;we
do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship's presence."</p>

<p>"Oh, prithee, say no more, 'tis glorious! &nbsp;If that I could but clothe me
in raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel in the mud once,
just once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego the
crown!"</p>

<p>"And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad&mdash;just
once&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oho, would'st like it? &nbsp;Then so shall it be. &nbsp;Doff thy rags, and don
these splendours, lad! &nbsp;It is a brief happiness, but will be not less
keen for that. &nbsp;We will have it while we may, and change again before any
come to molest."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom's
fluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked
out in the gaudy plumage of royalty. &nbsp;The two went and stood side by side
before a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to have been
any change made! &nbsp;They stared at each other, then at the glass, then at
each other again. &nbsp;At last the puzzled princeling said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What dost thou make of this?"</p>

<p>"Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer. &nbsp;It is not meet that
one of my degree should utter the thing."</p>

<p>"Then will _I_ utter it. &nbsp;Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the
same voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same face and
countenance that I bear. &nbsp;Fared we forth naked, there is none could say
which was you, and which the Prince of Wales. &nbsp;And, now that I am clothed
as thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more nearly to feel
as thou didst when the brute soldier&mdash;Hark ye, is not this a bruise upon
your hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor
man-at-arms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace! &nbsp;It was a shameful thing and a cruel!" cried the little prince,
stamping his bare foot. &nbsp;"If the King&mdash;Stir not a step till I come again!
It is a command!"</p>

<p>In a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national
importance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door and flying
through the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and
glowing eyes. &nbsp;As soon as he reached the great gate, he seized the bars,
and tried to shake them, shouting&mdash;</p>

<p>"Open! &nbsp;Unbar the gates!"</p>

<p>The soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince
burst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath, the soldier
fetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the
roadway, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take that, thou beggar's spawn, for what thou got'st me from his
Highness!"</p>

<p>The crowd roared with laughter. &nbsp;The prince picked himself out of the
mud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for
laying thy hand upon me!"</p>

<p>The soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I salute your gracious Highness." &nbsp;Then angrily&mdash;"Be off, thou crazy
rubbish!"</p>

<p>Here the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and hustled
him far down the road, hooting him, and shouting&mdash;</p>

<p>"Way for his Royal Highness! &nbsp;Way for the Prince of Wales!"</p>

<p>Chapter IV. The Prince's troubles begin.</p>

<p>After hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince was
at last deserted by the rabble and left to himself. &nbsp;As long as he had
been able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and royally
utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very
entertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was
no longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere.
He looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality. &nbsp;He was
within the city of London&mdash;that was all he knew. &nbsp;He moved on, aimlessly,
and in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by were
infrequent. &nbsp;He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed then
where Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed on, and
presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered houses in it,
and a prodigious church. &nbsp;He recognised this church. &nbsp;Scaffoldings were
about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was undergoing elaborate
repairs. &nbsp;The prince took heart at once&mdash;he felt that his troubles were
at an end, now. &nbsp;He said to himself, "It is the ancient Grey Friars'
Church, which the king my father hath taken from the monks and given for
a home for ever for poor and forsaken children, and new-named it Christ's
Church. &nbsp;Right gladly will they serve the son of him who hath done so
generously by them&mdash;and the more that that son is himself as poor and as
forlorn as any that be sheltered here this day, or ever shall be."</p>

<p>He was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping,
playing at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and
right noisily, too. &nbsp;They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion
which in that day prevailed among serving-men and 'prentices{1}&mdash;that is
to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the size
of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such scanty
dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair fell,
unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight around;
a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely and hung as
low as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt; bright yellow
stockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large metal buckles.
It was a sufficiently ugly costume.</p>

<p>The boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with
native dignity&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth
speech with him."</p>

<p>A great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Marry, art thou his grace's messenger, beggar?"</p>

<p>The prince's face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his hip,
but there was nothing there. &nbsp;There was a storm of laughter, and one boy
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Didst mark that? &nbsp;He fancied he had a sword&mdash;belike he is the prince
himself."</p>

<p>This sally brought more laughter. &nbsp;Poor Edward drew himself up proudly
and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my
father's bounty to use me so."</p>

<p>This was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified. &nbsp;The youth who had
first spoken, shouted to his comrades&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace's princely father, where be
your manners? &nbsp;Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence to
his kingly port and royal rags!"</p>

<p>With boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did
mock homage to their prey. &nbsp;The prince spurned the nearest boy with his
foot, and said fiercely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet!"</p>

<p>Ah, but this was not a joke&mdash;this was going beyond fun. &nbsp;The laughter
ceased on the instant, and fury took its place. &nbsp;A dozen shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hale him forth! &nbsp;To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond! &nbsp;Where be the
dogs? &nbsp;Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!"</p>

<p>Then followed such a thing as England had never seen before&mdash;the sacred
person of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands, and
set upon and torn by dogs.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>As night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far down in
the close-built portion of the city. &nbsp;His body was bruised, his hands
were bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched with mud. &nbsp;He wandered on
and on, and grew more and more bewildered, and so tired and faint he
could hardly drag one foot after the other. &nbsp;He had ceased to ask
questions of anyone, since they brought him only insult instead of
information. &nbsp;He kept muttering to himself, "Offal Court&mdash;that is the
name; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I drop,
then am I saved&mdash;for his people will take me to the palace and prove that
I am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have mine own
again." &nbsp;And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment by those
rude Christ's Hospital boys, and he said, "When I am king, they shall not
have bread and shelter only, but also teachings out of books; for a full
belly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the heart. &nbsp;I will
keep this diligently in my remembrance, that this day's lesson be not
lost upon me, and my people suffer thereby; for learning softeneth the
heart and breedeth gentleness and charity." {1}</p>

<p>The lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose, and a raw
and gusty night set in. &nbsp;The houseless prince, the homeless heir to the
throne of England, still moved on, drifting deeper into the maze of
squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were massed
together.</p>

<p>Suddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said&mdash;</p>

<br><br>
<a name="04-052"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="04-052.jpg (80K)" src="images/04-052.jpg" height="578" width="417">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Out to this time of night again, and hast not brought a farthing home, I
warrant me! &nbsp;If it be so, an' I do not break all the bones in thy lean
body, then am I not John Canty, but some other."</p>

<p>The prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his profaned
shoulder, and eagerly said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, art HIS father, truly? &nbsp;Sweet heaven grant it be so&mdash;then wilt thou
fetch him away and restore me!"</p>

<p>"HIS father? &nbsp;I know not what thou mean'st; I but know I am THY father,
as thou shalt soon have cause to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, jest not, palter not, delay not!&mdash;I am worn, I am wounded, I can
bear no more. &nbsp;Take me to the king my father, and he will make thee rich
beyond thy wildest dreams. &nbsp;Believe me, man, believe me!&mdash;I speak no lie,
but only the truth!&mdash;put forth thy hand and save me! &nbsp;I am indeed the
Prince of Wales!"</p>

<p>The man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his head and
muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gone stark mad as any Tom o' Bedlam!"&mdash;then collared him once more, and
said with a coarse laugh and an oath, "But mad or no mad, I and thy
Gammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or
I'm no true man!"</p>

<p>With this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away, and
disappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of
human vermin.</p>
