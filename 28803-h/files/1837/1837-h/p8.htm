<p>Chapter XXVII. In prison.</p>

<p>The cells were all crowded; so the two friends were chained in a large
room where persons charged with trifling offences were commonly kept.
They had company, for there were some twenty manacled and fettered
prisoners here, of both sexes and of varying ages,&mdash;an obscene and noisy
gang. &nbsp;The King chafed bitterly over the stupendous indignity thus put
upon his royalty, but Hendon was moody and taciturn. &nbsp;He was pretty
thoroughly bewildered; he had come home, a jubilant prodigal, expecting
to find everybody wild with joy over his return; and instead had got the
cold shoulder and a jail. &nbsp;The promise and the fulfilment differed so
widely that the effect was stunning; he could not decide whether it was
most tragic or most grotesque. &nbsp;He felt much as a man might who had
danced blithely out to enjoy a rainbow, and got struck by lightning.</p>

<p>But gradually his confused and tormenting thoughts settled down into some
sort of order, and then his mind centred itself upon Edith. &nbsp;He turned
her conduct over, and examined it in all lights, but he could not make
anything satisfactory out of it. &nbsp;Did she know him&mdash;or didn't she know
him? &nbsp;It was a perplexing puzzle, and occupied him a long time; but he
ended, finally, with the conviction that she did know him, and had
repudiated him for interested reasons. &nbsp;He wanted to load her name with
curses now; but this name had so long been sacred to him that he found he
could not bring his tongue to profane it.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>Wrapped in prison blankets of a soiled and tattered condition, Hendon and
the King passed a troubled night. &nbsp;For a bribe the jailer had furnished
liquor to some of the prisoners; singing of ribald songs, fighting,
shouting, and carousing was the natural consequence. &nbsp;At last, a while
after midnight, a man attacked a woman and nearly killed her by beating
her over the head with his manacles before the jailer could come to the
rescue. &nbsp;The jailer restored peace by giving the man a sound clubbing
about the head and shoulders&mdash;then the carousing ceased; and after that,
all had an opportunity to sleep who did not mind the annoyance of the
moanings and groanings of the two wounded people.</p>

<p>During the ensuing week, the days and nights were of a monotonous
sameness as to events; men whose faces Hendon remembered more or less
distinctly, came, by day, to gaze at the 'impostor' and repudiate and
insult him; and by night the carousing and brawling went on with
symmetrical regularity. &nbsp;However, there was a change of incident at last.
The jailer brought in an old man, and said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"The villain is in this room&mdash;cast thy old eyes about and see if thou
canst say which is he."</p>

<p>Hendon glanced up, and experienced a pleasant sensation for the first
time since he had been in the jail. &nbsp;He said to himself, "This is Blake
Andrews, a servant all his life in my father's family&mdash;a good honest
soul, with a right heart in his breast. That is, formerly. &nbsp;But none are
true now; all are liars. &nbsp;This man will know me&mdash;and will deny me, too,
like the rest."</p>

<p>The old man gazed around the room, glanced at each face in turn, and
finally said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I see none here but paltry knaves, scum o' the streets. &nbsp;Which is he?"</p>

<p>The jailer laughed.</p>

<p>"Here," he said; "scan this big animal, and grant me an opinion."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="27-320"></a>
<br><br>

<img alt="27-320.jpg (112K)" src="images/27-320.jpg" height="642" width="654">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>The old man approached, and looked Hendon over, long and earnestly, then
shook his head and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Marry, THIS is no Hendon&mdash;nor ever was!"</p>

<p>"Right! &nbsp;Thy old eyes are sound yet. &nbsp;An' I were Sir Hugh, I would take
the shabby carle and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The jailer finished by lifting himself a-tip-toe with an imaginary
halter, at the same time making a gurgling noise in his throat suggestive
of suffocation. &nbsp;The old man said, vindictively&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let him bless God an' he fare no worse. &nbsp;An' _I_ had the handling o' the
villain he should roast, or I am no true man!"</p>

<p>The jailer laughed a pleasant hyena laugh, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give him a piece of thy mind, old man&mdash;they all do it. &nbsp;Thou'lt find it
good diversion."</p>

<p>Then he sauntered toward his ante-room and disappeared. &nbsp;The old man
dropped upon his knees and whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"God be thanked, thou'rt come again, my master! &nbsp;I believed thou wert
dead these seven years, and lo, here thou art alive! &nbsp;I knew thee the
moment I saw thee; and main hard work it was to keep a stony countenance
and seem to see none here but tuppenny knaves and rubbish o' the streets.
I am old and poor, Sir Miles; but say the word and I will go forth and
proclaim the truth though I be strangled for it."</p>

<p>"No," said Hendon; "thou shalt not. &nbsp;It would ruin thee, and yet help but
little in my cause. &nbsp;But I thank thee, for thou hast given me back
somewhat of my lost faith in my kind."</p>

<p>The old servant became very valuable to Hendon and the King; for he
dropped in several times a day to 'abuse' the former, and always smuggled
in a few delicacies to help out the prison bill of fare; he also
furnished the current news. &nbsp;Hendon reserved the dainties for the King;
without them his Majesty might not have survived, for he was not able to
eat the coarse and wretched food provided by the jailer. &nbsp;Andrews was
obliged to confine himself to brief visits, in order to avoid suspicion;
but he managed to impart a fair degree of information each
time&mdash;information delivered in a low voice, for Hendon's benefit, and
interlarded with insulting epithets delivered in a louder voice for the
benefit of other hearers.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>So, little by little, the story of the family came out. &nbsp;Arthur had been
dead six years. &nbsp;This loss, with the absence of news from Hendon,
impaired the father's health; he believed he was going to die, and he
wished to see Hugh and Edith settled in life before he passed away; but
Edith begged hard for delay, hoping for Miles's return; then the letter
came which brought the news of Miles's death; the shock prostrated Sir
Richard; he believed his end was very near, and he and Hugh insisted upon
the marriage; Edith begged for and obtained a month's respite, then
another, and finally a third; the marriage then took place by the
death-bed of Sir Richard. &nbsp;It had not proved a happy one. &nbsp;It was whispered
about the country that shortly after the nuptials the bride found among
her husband's papers several rough and incomplete drafts of the fatal
letter, and had accused him of precipitating the marriage&mdash;and Sir
Richard's death, too&mdash;by a wicked forgery. Tales of cruelty to the Lady
Edith and the servants were to be heard on all hands; and since the
father's death Sir Hugh had thrown off all soft disguises and become a
pitiless master toward all who in any way depended upon him and his
domains for bread.</p>

<p>There was a bit of Andrew's gossip which the King listened to with a
lively interest&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is rumour that the King is mad. &nbsp;But in charity forbear to say _I_
mentioned it, for 'tis death to speak of it, they say."</p>

<p>His Majesty glared at the old man and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The King is NOT mad, good man&mdash;and thou'lt find it to thy advantage to
busy thyself with matters that nearer concern thee than this seditious
prattle."</p>

<p>"What doth the lad mean?" said Andrews, surprised at this brisk assault
from such an unexpected quarter. &nbsp;Hendon gave him a sign, and he did not
pursue his question, but went on with his budget&mdash;</p>

<p>"The late King is to be buried at Windsor in a day or two&mdash;the 16th of
the month&mdash;and the new King will be crowned at Westminster the 20th."</p>

<p>"Methinks they must needs find him first," muttered his Majesty; then
added, confidently, "but they will look to that&mdash;and so also shall I."</p>

<p>"In the name of&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the old man got no further&mdash;a warning sign from Hendon checked his
remark. &nbsp;He resumed the thread of his gossip&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Hugh goeth to the coronation&mdash;and with grand hopes. &nbsp;He confidently
looketh to come back a peer, for he is high in favour with the Lord
Protector."</p>

<p>"What Lord Protector?" asked his Majesty.</p>

<p>"His Grace the Duke of Somerset."</p>

<p>"What Duke of Somerset?"</p>

<p>"Marry, there is but one&mdash;Seymour, Earl of Hertford."</p>

<p>The King asked sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Since when is HE a duke, and Lord Protector?"</p>

<p>"Since the last day of January."</p>

<p>"And prithee who made him so?"</p>

<p>"Himself and the Great Council&mdash;with help of the King."</p>

<p>His Majesty started violently. &nbsp;"The KING!" he cried. &nbsp;"WHAT king, good
sir?"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="27-323"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="27-323.jpg (114K)" src="images/27-323.jpg" height="667" width="718">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"What king, indeed! (God-a-mercy, what aileth the boy?) &nbsp;Sith we have but
one, 'tis not difficult to answer&mdash;his most sacred Majesty King Edward
the Sixth&mdash;whom God preserve! &nbsp;Yea, and a dear and gracious little urchin
is he, too; and whether he be mad or no&mdash;and they say he mendeth
daily&mdash;his praises are on all men's lips; and all bless him, likewise, and offer
prayers that he may be spared to reign long in England; for he began
humanely with saving the old Duke of Norfolk's life, and now is he bent
on destroying the cruellest of the laws that harry and oppress the
people."</p>

<p>This news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement, and plunged him into so
deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the old man's gossip.
He wondered if the 'little urchin' was the beggar-boy whom he left
dressed in his own garments in the palace. &nbsp;It did not seem possible that
this could be, for surely his manners and speech would betray him if he
pretended to be the Prince of Wales&mdash;then he would be driven out, and
search made for the true prince. &nbsp;Could it be that the Court had set up
some sprig of the nobility in his place? &nbsp;No, for his uncle would not
allow that&mdash;he was all-powerful and could and would crush such a
movement, of course. &nbsp;The boy's musings profited him nothing; the more he
tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he became, the more his
head ached, and the worse he slept. &nbsp;His impatience to get to London grew
hourly, and his captivity became almost unendurable.</p>

<p>Hendon's arts all failed with the King&mdash;he could not be comforted; but a
couple of women who were chained near him succeeded better. Under their
gentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of patience. &nbsp;He
was very grateful, and came to love them dearly and to delight in the
sweet and soothing influence of their presence. &nbsp;He asked them why they
were in prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he smiled, and
inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison? &nbsp;Now I grieve, for I
shall lose ye&mdash;they will not keep ye long for such a little thing."</p>

<p>They did not answer; and something in their faces made him uneasy. He
said, eagerly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You do not speak; be good to me, and tell me&mdash;there will be no other
punishment? &nbsp;Prithee tell me there is no fear of that."</p>

<p>They tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and he
pursued it&mdash;</p>

<p>"Will they scourge thee? &nbsp;No, no, they would not be so cruel! &nbsp;Say they
would not. &nbsp;Come, they WILL not, will they?"</p>

<p>The women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no avoiding an
answer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with emotion&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, thou'lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit!&mdash;God will help us to
bear our&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is a confession!" the King broke in. &nbsp;"Then they WILL scourge thee,
the stony-hearted wretches! &nbsp;But oh, thou must not weep, I cannot bear
it. &nbsp;Keep up thy courage&mdash;I shall come to my own in time to save thee
from this bitter thing, and I will do it!"</p>

<p>When the King awoke in the morning, the women were gone.</p>

<p>"They are saved!" he said, joyfully; then added, despondently, "but woe
is me!&mdash;for they were my comforters."</p>

<p>Each of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing, in token
of remembrance. &nbsp;He said he would keep these things always; and that soon
he would seek out these dear good friends of his and take them under his
protection.</p>

<p>Just then the jailer came in with some subordinates, and commanded that
the prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard. &nbsp;The King was overjoyed&mdash;it
would be a blessed thing to see the blue sky and breathe the fresh air
once more. &nbsp;He fretted and chafed at the slowness of the officers, but
his turn came at last, and he was released from his staple and ordered to
follow the other prisoners with Hendon.</p>

<p>The court or quadrangle was stone-paved, and open to the sky. &nbsp;The
prisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry, and were
placed in file, standing, with their backs against the wall. A rope was
stretched in front of them, and they were also guarded by their officers.
It was a chill and lowering morning, and a light snow which had fallen
during the night whitened the great empty space and added to the general
dismalness of its aspect. Now and then a wintry wind shivered through the
place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither.</p>

<img alt="27-326.jpg (53K)" src="images/27-326.jpg" height="627" width="384">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>In the centre of the court stood two women, chained to posts. &nbsp;A glance
showed the King that these were his good friends. &nbsp;He shuddered, and said
to himself, "Alack, they are not gone free, as I had thought. &nbsp;To think
that such as these should know the lash!&mdash;in England! &nbsp;Ay, there's the
shame of it&mdash;not in Heathennesse, Christian England! &nbsp;They will be
scourged; and I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must look
on and see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange, that I, the
very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect them.
But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there is a day
coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work. &nbsp;For
every blow they strike now, they shall feel a hundred then."</p>

<p>A great gate swung open, and a crowd of citizens poured in. &nbsp;They flocked
around the two women, and hid them from the King's view. A clergyman
entered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden. &nbsp;The King
now heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being asked and
answered, but he could not make out what was said. &nbsp;Next there was a deal
of bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of officials
through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side of the
women; and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon the
people.</p>

<p>Now, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the King saw a
spectacle that froze the marrow in his bones. &nbsp;Faggots had been piled
about the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting them!</p>

<p>The women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their hands;
the yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling
faggots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind; the
clergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer&mdash;just then two young girls
came flying through the great gate, uttering piercing screams, and threw
themselves upon the women at the stake. &nbsp;Instantly they were torn away by
the officers, and one of them was kept in a tight grip, but the other
broke loose, saying she would die with her mother; and before she could
be stopped she had flung her arms about her mother's neck again. &nbsp;She was
torn away once more, and with her gown on fire. &nbsp;Two or three men held
her, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and thrown
flaming aside, she struggling all the while to free herself, and saying
she would be alone in the world, now; and begging to be allowed to die
with her mother. &nbsp;Both the girls screamed continually, and fought for
freedom; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of
heart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony&mdash;the King glanced from the frantic girls
to the stake, then turned away and leaned his ashen face against the
wall, and looked no more. &nbsp;He said, "That which I have seen, in that one
little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will abide there;
and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the nights, till I
die. &nbsp;Would God I had been blind!"</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>Hendon was watching the King. &nbsp;He said to himself, with satisfaction,
"His disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and groweth gentler. &nbsp;If he had
followed his wont, he would have stormed at these varlets, and said he
was King, and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed. &nbsp;Soon
his delusion will pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be
whole again. &nbsp;God speed the day!"</p>

<p>That same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night, who
were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in the kingdom, to
undergo punishment for crimes committed. &nbsp;The King conversed with
these&mdash;he had made it a point, from the beginning, to instruct himself for the
kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity
offered&mdash;and the tale of their woes wrung his heart. &nbsp;One of them was a poor
half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a weaver&mdash;she was
to be hanged for it. &nbsp;Another was a man who had been accused of stealing
a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had imagined that he was
safe from the halter; but no&mdash;he was hardly free before he was arraigned
for killing a deer in the King's park; this was proved against him, and
now he was on his way to the gallows. &nbsp;There was a tradesman's apprentice
whose case particularly distressed the King; this youth said he found a
hawk, one evening, that had escaped from its owner, and he took it home
with him, imagining himself entitled to it; but the court convicted him
of stealing it, and sentenced him to death.</p>

<p>The King was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon to break
jail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could mount his throne
and hold out his sceptre in mercy over these unfortunate people and save
their lives. &nbsp;"Poor child," sighed Hendon, "these woeful tales have
brought his malady upon him again; alack, but for this evil hap, he would
have been well in a little time."</p>

<p>Among these prisoners was an old lawyer&mdash;a man with a strong face and a
dauntless mien. &nbsp;Three years past, he had written a pamphlet against the
Lord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice, and had been punished for it
by the loss of his ears in the pillory, and degradation from the bar, and
in addition had been fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to imprisonment for
life. &nbsp;Lately he had repeated his offence; and in consequence was now
under sentence to lose WHAT REMAINED OF HIS EARS, pay a fine of 5,000
pounds, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in prison for life.</p>

<p>"These be honourable scars," he said, and turned back his grey hair and
showed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears.</p>

<p>The King's eye burned with passion. &nbsp;He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"None believe in me&mdash;neither wilt thou. &nbsp;But no matter&mdash;within the
compass of a month thou shalt be free; and more, the laws that have
dishonoured thee, and shamed the English name, shall be swept from the
statute books. &nbsp;The world is made wrong; kings should go to school to
their own laws, at times, and so learn mercy." {1}</p>

<p>Chapter XXVIII. The sacrifice.</p>

<p>Meantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and
inaction. &nbsp;But now his trial came on, to his great gratification, and he
thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment
should not be a part of it. &nbsp;But he was mistaken about that. &nbsp;He was in a
fine fury when he found himself described as a 'sturdy vagabond' and
sentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character and
for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall. &nbsp;His pretensions as to
brothership with his prosecutor, and rightful heirship to the Hendon
honours and estates, were left contemptuously unnoticed, as being not
even worth examination.</p>

<p>He raged and threatened on his way to punishment, but it did no good; he
was snatched roughly along by the officers, and got an occasional cuff,
besides, for his irreverent conduct.</p>

<p>The King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed behind; so he
was obliged to follow in the rear, remote from his good friend and
servant. &nbsp;The King had been nearly condemned to the stocks himself for
being in such bad company, but had been let off with a lecture and a
warning, in consideration of his youth. &nbsp;When the crowd at last halted,
he flitted feverishly from point to point around its outer rim, hunting a
place to get through; and at last, after a deal of difficulty and delay,
succeeded. &nbsp;There sat his poor henchman in the degrading stocks, the
sport and butt of a dirty mob&mdash;he, the body servant of the King of
England! &nbsp;Edward had heard the sentence pronounced, but he had not
realised the half that it meant. &nbsp;His anger began to rise as the sense of
this new indignity which had been put upon him sank home; it jumped to
summer heat, the next moment, when he saw an egg sail through the air and
crush itself against Hendon's cheek, and heard the crowd roar its
enjoyment of the episode. &nbsp;He sprang across the open circle and
confronted the officer in charge, crying&mdash;</p>

<br><br>
<a name="28-334"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="28-334.jpg (119K)" src="images/28-334.jpg" height="637" width="707">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"For shame! &nbsp;This is my servant&mdash;set him free! &nbsp;I am the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, peace!" exclaimed Hendon, in a panic, "thou'lt destroy thyself.
Mind him not, officer, he is mad."</p>

<p>"Give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him, good man, I
have small mind to mind him; but as to teaching him somewhat, to that I
am well inclined." &nbsp;He turned to a subordinate and said, "Give the little
fool a taste or two of the lash, to mend his manners."</p>

<p>"Half a dozen will better serve his turn," suggested Sir Hugh, who had
ridden up, a moment before, to take a passing glance at the proceedings.</p>

<p>The King was seized. &nbsp;He did not even struggle, so paralysed was he with
the mere thought of the monstrous outrage that was proposed to be
inflicted upon his sacred person. &nbsp;History was already defiled with the
record of the scourging of an English king with whips&mdash;it was an
intolerable reflection that he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful
page. &nbsp;He was in the toils, there was no help for him; he must either
take this punishment or beg for its remission. &nbsp;Hard conditions; he would
take the stripes&mdash;a king might do that, but a king could not beg.</p>

<p>But meantime, Miles Hendon was resolving the difficulty. &nbsp;"Let the child
go," said he; "ye heartless dogs, do ye not see how young and frail he
is? &nbsp;Let him go&mdash;I will take his lashes."</p>

<p>"Marry, a good thought&mdash;and thanks for it," said Sir Hugh, his face
lighting with a sardonic satisfaction. &nbsp;"Let the little beggar go, and
give this fellow a dozen in his place&mdash;an honest dozen, well laid on."
The King was in the act of entering a fierce protest, but Sir Hugh
silenced him with the potent remark, "Yes, speak up, do, and free thy
mind&mdash;only, mark ye, that for each word you utter he shall get six
strokes the more."</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>Hendon was removed from the stocks, and his back laid bare; and whilst
the lash was applied the poor little King turned away his face and
allowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked. "Ah, brave good
heart," he said to himself, "this loyal deed shall never perish out of my
memory. &nbsp;I will not forget it&mdash;and neither shall THEY!" he added, with
passion. &nbsp;Whilst he mused, his appreciation of Hendon's magnanimous
conduct grew to greater and still greater dimensions in his mind, and so
also did his gratefulness for it. &nbsp;Presently he said to himself, "Who
saves his prince from wounds and possible death&mdash;and this he did for
me&mdash;performs high service; but it is little&mdash;it is nothing&mdash;oh, less than
nothing!&mdash;when 'tis weighed against the act of him who saves his prince
from SHAME!"</p>

<p>Hendon made no outcry under the scourge, but bore the heavy blows with
soldierly fortitude. &nbsp;This, together with his redeeming the boy by taking
his stripes for him, compelled the respect of even that forlorn and
degraded mob that was gathered there; and its gibes and hootings died
away, and no sound remained but the sound of the falling blows. &nbsp;The
stillness that pervaded the place, when Hendon found himself once more in
the stocks, was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour which had
prevailed there so little a while before. &nbsp;The King came softly to
Hendon's side, and whispered in his ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"Kings cannot ennoble thee, thou good, great soul, for One who is higher
than kings hath done that for thee; but a king can confirm thy nobility
to men." &nbsp;He picked up the scourge from the ground, touched Hendon's
bleeding shoulders lightly with it, and whispered, "Edward of England
dubs thee Earl!"</p>

<p>Hendon was touched. &nbsp;The water welled to his eyes, yet at the same time
the grisly humour of the situation and circumstances so undermined his
gravity that it was all he could do to keep some sign of his inward mirth
from showing outside. &nbsp;To be suddenly hoisted, naked and gory, from the
common stocks to the Alpine altitude and splendour of an Earldom, seemed
to him the last possibility in the line of the grotesque. &nbsp;He said to
himself, "Now am I finely tinselled, indeed! &nbsp;The spectre-knight of the
Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows is become a spectre-earl&mdash;a dizzy flight
for a callow wing! &nbsp;An' this go on, I shall presently be hung like a very
maypole with fantastic gauds and make-believe honours. &nbsp;But I shall value
them, all valueless as they are, for the love that doth bestow them.
Better these poor mock dignities of mine, that come unasked, from a clean
hand and a right spirit, than real ones bought by servility from grudging
and interested power."</p>

<p>The dreaded Sir Hugh wheeled his horse about, and as he spurred away, the
living wall divided silently to let him pass, and as silently closed
together again. &nbsp;And so remained; nobody went so far as to venture a
remark in favour of the prisoner, or in compliment to him; but no
matter&mdash;the absence of abuse was a sufficient homage in itself. &nbsp;A late comer
who was not posted as to the present circumstances, and who delivered a
sneer at the 'impostor,' and was in the act of following it with a dead
cat, was promptly knocked down and kicked out, without any words, and
then the deep quiet resumed sway once more.</p>

<p>Chapter XXIX. To London.</p>

<p>When Hendon's term of service in the stocks was finished, he was released
and ordered to quit the region and come back no more. His sword was
restored to him, and also his mule and his donkey. He mounted and rode
off, followed by the King, the crowd opening with quiet respectfulness to
let them pass, and then dispersing when they were gone.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>Hendon was soon absorbed in thought. &nbsp;There were questions of high import
to be answered. &nbsp;What should he do? &nbsp;Whither should he go? Powerful help
must be found somewhere, or he must relinquish his inheritance and remain
under the imputation of being an impostor besides. &nbsp;Where could he hope
to find this powerful help? &nbsp;Where, indeed! &nbsp;It was a knotty question.
By-and-by a thought occurred to him which pointed to a possibility&mdash;the
slenderest of slender possibilities, certainly, but still worth
considering, for lack of any other that promised anything at all. &nbsp;He
remembered what old Andrews had said about the young King's goodness and
his generous championship of the wronged and unfortunate. &nbsp;Why not go and
try to get speech of him and beg for justice? &nbsp;Ah, yes, but could so
fantastic a pauper get admission to the august presence of a monarch?
Never mind&mdash;let that matter take care of itself; it was a bridge that
would not need to be crossed till he should come to it. &nbsp;He was an old
campaigner, and used to inventing shifts and expedients: &nbsp;no doubt he
would be able to find a way. &nbsp;Yes, he would strike for the capital.
Maybe his father's old friend Sir Humphrey Marlow would help him&mdash;'good
old Sir Humphrey, Head Lieutenant of the late King's kitchen, or stables,
or something'&mdash;Miles could not remember just what or which. &nbsp;Now that he
had something to turn his energies to, a distinctly defined object to
accomplish, the fog of humiliation and depression which had settled down
upon his spirits lifted and blew away, and he raised his head and looked
about him. &nbsp;He was surprised to see how far he had come; the village was
away behind him. &nbsp;The King was jogging along in his wake, with his head
bowed; for he, too, was deep in plans and thinkings. &nbsp;A sorrowful
misgiving clouded Hendon's new-born cheerfulness: &nbsp;would the boy be
willing to go again to a city where, during all his brief life, he had
never known anything but ill-usage and pinching want? &nbsp;But the question
must be asked; it could not be avoided; so Hendon reined up, and called
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had forgotten to inquire whither we are bound. &nbsp;Thy commands, my
liege!"</p>

<p>"To London!"</p>

<p>Hendon moved on again, mightily contented with the answer&mdash;but astounded
at it too.</p>

<p>The whole journey was made without an adventure of importance. But it
ended with one. &nbsp;About ten o'clock on the night of the 19th of February
they stepped upon London Bridge, in the midst of a writhing, struggling
jam of howling and hurrahing people, whose beer-jolly faces stood out
strongly in the glare from manifold torches&mdash;and at that instant the
decaying head of some former duke or other grandee tumbled down between
them, striking Hendon on the elbow and then bounding off among the
hurrying confusion of feet. So evanescent and unstable are men's works in
this world!&mdash;the late good King is but three weeks dead and three days in
his grave, and already the adornments which he took such pains to select
from prominent people for his noble bridge are falling. &nbsp;A citizen
stumbled over that head, and drove his own head into the back of somebody
in front of him, who turned and knocked down the first person that came
handy, and was promptly laid out himself by that person's friend. &nbsp;It was
the right ripe time for a free fight, for the festivities of the
morrow&mdash;Coronation Day&mdash;were already beginning; everybody was full of strong
drink and patriotism; within five minutes the free fight was occupying a
good deal of ground; within ten or twelve it covered an acre of so, and
was become a riot. &nbsp;By this time Hendon and the King were hopelessly
separated from each other and lost in the rush and turmoil of the roaring
masses of humanity. &nbsp;And so we leave them.</p>

<p>Chapter XXX. Tom's progress.</p>

<p>Whilst the true King wandered about the land poorly clad, poorly fed,
cuffed and derided by tramps one while, herding with thieves and
murderers in a jail another, and called idiot and impostor by all
impartially, the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed quite a different
experience.</p>

<p>When we saw him last, royalty was just beginning to have a bright side
for him. &nbsp;This bright side went on brightening more and more every day:
in a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and
delightfulness. &nbsp;He lost his fears; his misgivings faded out and died;
his embarrassments departed, and gave place to an easy and confident
bearing. &nbsp;He worked the whipping-boy mine to ever-increasing profit.</p>

<p>He ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Grey into his presence when
he wanted to play or talk, and dismissed them when he was done with them,
with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances. &nbsp;It no
longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand at
parting.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>He came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night, and dressed
with intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning. &nbsp;It came to be a proud
pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession of
officers of state and gentlemen-at-arms; insomuch, indeed, that he
doubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms, and made them a hundred. &nbsp;He
liked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors, and the
distant voices responding, "Way for the King!"</p>

<p>He even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council, and seeming
to be something more than the Lord Protector's mouthpiece. He liked to
receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains, and listen to the
affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who called
him brother. &nbsp;O happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court!</p>

<p>He enjoyed his splendid clothes, and ordered more: &nbsp;he found his four
hundred servants too few for his proper grandeur, and trebled them. &nbsp;The
adulation of salaaming courtiers came to be sweet music to his ears. &nbsp;He
remained kind and gentle, and a sturdy and determined champion of all
that were oppressed, and he made tireless war upon unjust laws: &nbsp;yet upon
occasion, being offended, he could turn upon an earl, or even a duke, and
give him a look that would make him tremble. &nbsp;Once, when his royal
'sister,' the grimly holy Lady Mary, set herself to reason with him
against the wisdom of his course in pardoning so many people who would
otherwise be jailed, or hanged, or burned, and reminded him that their
august late father's prisons had sometimes contained as high as sixty
thousand convicts at one time, and that during his admirable reign he had
delivered seventy-two thousand thieves and robbers over to death by the
executioner, {9} the boy was filled with generous indignation, and
commanded her to go to her closet, and beseech God to take away the stone
that was in her breast, and give her a human heart.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>Did Tom Canty never feel troubled about the poor little rightful prince
who had treated him so kindly, and flown out with such hot zeal to avenge
him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace-gate? Yes; his first royal
days and nights were pretty well sprinkled with painful thoughts about
the lost prince, and with sincere longings for his return, and happy
restoration to his native rights and splendours. &nbsp;But as time wore on,
and the prince did not come, Tom's mind became more and more occupied
with his new and enchanting experiences, and by little and little the
vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts; and finally, when he
did intrude upon them at intervals, he was become an unwelcome spectre,
for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed.</p>

<p>Tom's poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his mind.
At first he pined for them, sorrowed for them, longed to see them, but
later, the thought of their coming some day in their rags and dirt, and
betraying him with their kisses, and pulling him down from his lofty
place, and dragging him back to penury and degradation and the slums,
made him shudder. &nbsp;At last they ceased to trouble his thoughts almost
wholly. &nbsp;And he was content, even glad: &nbsp;for, whenever their mournful and
accusing faces did rise before him now, they made him feel more
despicable than the worms that crawl.</p>

<p>At midnight of the 19th of February, Tom Canty was sinking to sleep in
his rich bed in the palace, guarded by his loyal vassals, and surrounded
by the pomps of royalty, a happy boy; for tomorrow was the day appointed
for his solemn crowning as King of England. At that same hour, Edward,
the true king, hungry and thirsty, soiled and draggled, worn with travel,
and clothed in rags and shreds&mdash;his share of the results of the riot&mdash;was
wedged in among a crowd of people who were watching with deep interest
certain hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of Westminster
Abbey, busy as ants: &nbsp;they were making the last preparation for the royal
coronation.</p>

<p>Chapter XXXI. The Recognition procession.</p>

<p>When Tom Canty awoke the next morning, the air was heavy with a
thunderous murmur: &nbsp;all the distances were charged with it. &nbsp;It was music
to him; for it meant that the English world was out in its strength to
give loyal welcome to the great day.</p>

<p>Presently Tom found himself once more the chief figure in a wonderful
floating pageant on the Thames; for by ancient custom the 'recognition
procession' through London must start from the Tower, and he was bound
thither.</p>

<p>When he arrived there, the sides of the venerable fortress seemed
suddenly rent in a thousand places, and from every rent leaped a red
tongue of flame and a white gush of smoke; a deafening explosion
followed, which drowned the shoutings of the multitude, and made the
ground tremble; the flame-jets, the smoke, and the explosions, were
repeated over and over again with marvellous celerity, so that in a few
moments the old Tower disappeared in the vast fog of its own smoke, all
but the very top of the tall pile called the White Tower; this, with its
banners, stood out above the dense bank of vapour as a mountain-peak
projects above a cloud-rack.</p>

<p>Tom Canty, splendidly arrayed, mounted a prancing war-steed, whose rich
trappings almost reached to the ground; his 'uncle,' the Lord Protector
Somerset, similarly mounted, took place in his rear; the King's Guard
formed in single ranks on either side, clad in burnished armour; after
the Protector followed a seemingly interminable procession of resplendent
nobles attended by their vassals; after these came the lord mayor and the
aldermanic body, in crimson velvet robes, and with their gold chains
across their breasts; and after these the officers and members of all the
guilds of London, in rich raiment, and bearing the showy banners of the
several corporations. &nbsp;Also in the procession, as a special guard of
honour through the city, was the Ancient and Honourable Artillery
Company&mdash;an organisation already three hundred years old at that time,
and the only military body in England possessing the privilege (which it
still possesses in our day) of holding itself independent of the commands
of Parliament. &nbsp;It was a brilliant spectacle, and was hailed with
acclamations all along the line, as it took its stately way through the
packed multitudes of citizens. The chronicler says, 'The King, as he
entered the city, was received by the people with prayers, welcomings,
cries, and tender words, and all signs which argue an earnest love of
subjects toward their sovereign; and the King, by holding up his glad
countenance to such as stood afar off, and most tender language to those
that stood nigh his Grace, showed himself no less thankful to receive the
people's goodwill than they to offer it. &nbsp;To all that wished him well, he
gave thanks. &nbsp;To such as bade "God save his Grace," he said in return,
"God save you all!" and added that "he thanked them with all his heart."
Wonderfully transported were the people with the loving answers and
gestures of their King.'</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>In Fenchurch Street a 'fair child, in costly apparel,' stood on a stage
to welcome his Majesty to the city. &nbsp;The last verse of his greeting was
in these words&mdash;</p>

<center>
<table summary="">
<tr><td>
<p><br>
'Welcome, O King! as much as hearts can think;<br>
Welcome, again, as much as tongue can tell,&mdash;<br>
Welcome to joyous tongues, and hearts that will not shrink: <br>
God thee preserve, we pray, and wish thee ever well.'</p>

</td></tr>
</table>
</center>



<p>The people burst forth in a glad shout, repeating with one voice what the
child had said. &nbsp;Tom Canty gazed abroad over the surging sea of eager
faces, and his heart swelled with exultation; and he felt that the one
thing worth living for in this world was to be a king, and a nation's
idol. &nbsp;Presently he caught sight, at a distance, of a couple of his
ragged Offal Court comrades&mdash;one of them the lord high admiral in his
late mimic court, the other the first lord of the bedchamber in the same
pretentious fiction; and his pride swelled higher than ever. &nbsp;Oh, if they
could only recognise him now! &nbsp;What unspeakable glory it would be, if
they could recognise him, and realise that the derided mock king of the
slums and back alleys was become a real King, with illustrious dukes and
princes for his humble menials, and the English world at his feet! &nbsp;But
he had to deny himself, and choke down his desire, for such a recognition
might cost more than it would come to: &nbsp;so he turned away his head, and
left the two soiled lads to go on with their shoutings and glad
adulations, unsuspicious of whom it was they were lavishing them upon.</p>

<p>Every now and then rose the cry, "A largess! a largess!" and Tom
responded by scattering a handful of bright new coins abroad for the
multitude to scramble for.</p>

<p>The chronicler says, 'At the upper end of Gracechurch Street, before the
sign of the Eagle, the city had erected a gorgeous arch, beneath which
was a stage, which stretched from one side of the street to the other.
This was an historical pageant, representing the King's immediate
progenitors. &nbsp;There sat Elizabeth of York in the midst of an immense
white rose, whose petals formed elaborate furbelows around her; by her
side was Henry VII., issuing out of a vast red rose, disposed in the same
manner: &nbsp;the hands of the royal pair were locked together, and the
wedding-ring ostentatiously displayed. &nbsp;From the red and white roses
proceeded a stem, which reached up to a second stage, occupied by Henry
VIII., issuing from a red and white rose, with the effigy of the new
King's mother, Jane Seymour, represented by his side. &nbsp;One branch sprang
from this pair, which mounted to a third stage, where sat the effigy of
Edward VI. himself, enthroned in royal majesty; and the whole pageant was
framed with wreaths of roses, red and white.'</p>

<p>This quaint and gaudy spectacle so wrought upon the rejoicing people,
that their acclamations utterly smothered the small voice of the child
whose business it was to explain the thing in eulogistic rhymes. &nbsp;But Tom
Canty was not sorry; for this loyal uproar was sweeter music to him than
any poetry, no matter what its quality might be. &nbsp;Whithersoever Tom
turned his happy young face, the people recognised the exactness of his
effigy's likeness to himself, the flesh and blood counterpart; and new
whirlwinds of applause burst forth.</p>

<p>The great pageant moved on, and still on, under one triumphal arch after
another, and past a bewildering succession of spectacular and symbolical
tableaux, each of which typified and exalted some virtue, or talent, or
merit, of the little King's. &nbsp;'Throughout the whole of Cheapside, from
every penthouse and window, hung banners and streamers; and the richest
carpets, stuffs, and cloth-of-gold tapestried the streets&mdash;specimens of
the great wealth of the stores within; and the splendour of this
thoroughfare was equalled in the other streets, and in some even
surpassed.'</p>

<p>"And all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me&mdash;me!" murmured
Tom Canty.</p>

<p>The mock King's cheeks were flushed with excitement, his eyes were
flashing, his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure. &nbsp;At this point, just
as he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess, he caught sight
of a pale, astounded face, which was strained forward out of the second
rank of the crowd, its intense eyes riveted upon him. &nbsp;A sickening
consternation struck through him; he recognised his mother! and up flew
his hand, palm outward, before his eyes&mdash;that old involuntary gesture,
born of a forgotten episode, and perpetuated by habit. &nbsp;In an instant
more she had torn her way out of the press, and past the guards, and was
at his side. &nbsp;She embraced his leg, she covered it with kisses, she
cried, "O my child, my darling!" lifting toward him a face that was
transfigured with joy and love. &nbsp;The same instant an officer of the
King's Guard snatched her away with a curse, and sent her reeling back
whence she came with a vigorous impulse from his strong arm. &nbsp;The words
"I do not know you, woman!" were falling from Tom Canty's lips when this
piteous thing occurred; but it smote him to the heart to see her treated
so; and as she turned for a last glimpse of him, whilst the crowd was
swallowing her from his sight, she seemed so wounded, so broken-hearted,
that a shame fell upon him which consumed his pride to ashes, and
withered his stolen royalty. &nbsp;His grandeurs were stricken valueless:
they seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags.</p>

<p>The procession moved on, and still on, through ever augmenting splendours
and ever augmenting tempests of welcome; but to Tom Canty they were as if
they had not been. &nbsp;He neither saw nor heard. &nbsp;Royalty had lost its grace
and sweetness; its pomps were become a reproach. &nbsp;Remorse was eating his
heart out. &nbsp;He said, "Would God I were free of my captivity!"</p>

<p>He had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the first days
of his compulsory greatness.</p>

<p>The shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and interminable
serpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city, and through the
huzzaing hosts; but still the King rode with bowed head and vacant eyes,
seeing only his mother's face and that wounded look in it.</p>

<p>"Largess, largess!" &nbsp;The cry fell upon an unheeding ear.</p>

<p>"Long live Edward of England!" &nbsp;It seemed as if the earth shook with the
explosion; but there was no response from the King. &nbsp;He heard it only as
one hears the thunder of the surf when it is blown to the ear out of a
great distance, for it was smothered under another sound which was still
nearer, in his own breast, in his accusing conscience&mdash;a voice which kept
repeating those shameful words, "I do not know you, woman!"</p>

<p>The words smote upon the King's soul as the strokes of a funeral bell
smite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him of secret
treacheries suffered at his hands by him that is gone.</p>

<p>New glories were unfolded at every turning; new wonders, new marvels,
sprang into view; the pent clamours of waiting batteries were released;
new raptures poured from the throats of the waiting multitudes: &nbsp;but the
King gave no sign, and the accusing voice that went moaning through his
comfortless breast was all the sound he heard.</p>

<p>By-and-by the gladness in the faces of the populace changed a little, and
became touched with a something like solicitude or anxiety: &nbsp;an abatement
in the volume of the applause was observable too. &nbsp;The Lord Protector was
quick to notice these things: &nbsp;he was as quick to detect the cause. &nbsp;He
spurred to the King's side, bent low in his saddle, uncovered, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My liege, it is an ill time for dreaming. &nbsp;The people observe thy
downcast head, thy clouded mien, and they take it for an omen. &nbsp;Be
advised: &nbsp;unveil the sun of royalty, and let it shine upon these boding
vapours, and disperse them. &nbsp;Lift up thy face, and smile upon the
people."</p>

<p>So saying, the Duke scattered a handful of coins to right and left, then
retired to his place. &nbsp;The mock King did mechanically as he had been
bidden. &nbsp;His smile had no heart in it, but few eyes were near enough or
sharp enough to detect that. &nbsp;The noddings of his plumed head as he
saluted his subjects were full of grace and graciousness; the largess
which he delivered from his hand was royally liberal: &nbsp;so the people's
anxiety vanished, and the acclamations burst forth again in as mighty a
volume as before.</p>

<p>Still once more, a little before the progress was ended, the Duke was
obliged to ride forward, and make remonstrance. &nbsp;He whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"O dread sovereign! shake off these fatal humours; the eyes of the world
are upon thee." &nbsp;Then he added with sharp annoyance, "Perdition catch
that crazy pauper! 'twas she that hath disturbed your Highness."</p>

<p>The gorgeous figure turned a lustreless eye upon the Duke, and said in a
dead voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"She was my mother!"</p>

<p>"My God!" groaned the Protector as he reined his horse backward to his
post, "the omen was pregnant with prophecy. &nbsp;He is gone mad again!"</p>
