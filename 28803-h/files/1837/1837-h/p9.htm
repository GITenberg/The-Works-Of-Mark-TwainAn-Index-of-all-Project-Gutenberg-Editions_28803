<p>Chapter XXXII. Coronation Day.</p>

<p>Let us go backward a few hours, and place ourselves in Westminster Abbey,
at four o'clock in the morning of this memorable Coronation Day. &nbsp;We are
not without company; for although it is still night, we find the
torch-lighted galleries already filling up with people who are well content to
sit still and wait seven or eight hours till the time shall come for them
to see what they may not hope to see twice in their lives&mdash;the coronation
of a King. &nbsp;Yes, London and Westminster have been astir ever since the
warning guns boomed at three o'clock, and already crowds of untitled rich
folk who have bought the privilege of trying to find sitting-room in the
galleries are flocking in at the entrances reserved for their sort.</p>

<p>The hours drag along tediously enough. &nbsp;All stir has ceased for some
time, for every gallery has long ago been packed. &nbsp;We may sit, now, and
look and think at our leisure. &nbsp;We have glimpses, here and there and
yonder, through the dim cathedral twilight, of portions of many galleries
and balconies, wedged full with other people, the other portions of these
galleries and balconies being cut off from sight by intervening pillars
and architectural projections. &nbsp;We have in view the whole of the great
north transept&mdash;empty, and waiting for England's privileged ones. &nbsp;We see
also the ample area or platform, carpeted with rich stuffs, whereon the
throne stands. &nbsp;The throne occupies the centre of the platform, and is
raised above it upon an elevation of four steps. Within the seat of the
throne is enclosed a rough flat rock&mdash;the stone of Scone&mdash;which many
generations of Scottish kings sat on to be crowned, and so it in time
became holy enough to answer a like purpose for English monarchs. &nbsp;Both
the throne and its footstool are covered with cloth of gold.</p>

<p>Stillness reigns, the torches blink dully, the time drags heavily. But at
last the lagging daylight asserts itself, the torches are extinguished,
and a mellow radiance suffuses the great spaces. All features of the
noble building are distinct now, but soft and dreamy, for the sun is
lightly veiled with clouds.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock the first break in the drowsy monotony occurs; for on
the stroke of this hour the first peeress enters the transept, clothed
like Solomon for splendour, and is conducted to her appointed place by an
official clad in satins and velvets, whilst a duplicate of him gathers up
the lady's long train, follows after, and, when the lady is seated,
arranges the train across her lap for her. &nbsp;He then places her footstool
according to her desire, after which he puts her coronet where it will be
convenient to her hand when the time for the simultaneous coroneting of
the nobles shall arrive.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="32-366"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="32-366.jpg (53K)" src="images/32-366.jpg" height="366" width="732">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>By this time the peeresses are flowing in in a glittering stream, and the
satin-clad officials are flitting and glinting everywhere, seating them
and making them comfortable. &nbsp;The scene is animated enough now. &nbsp;There is
stir and life, and shifting colour everywhere. &nbsp;After a time, quiet
reigns again; for the peeresses are all come and are all in their places,
a solid acre or such a matter, of human flowers, resplendent in
variegated colours, and frosted like a Milky Way with diamonds. &nbsp;There
are all ages here: brown, wrinkled, white-haired dowagers who are able to
go back, and still back, down the stream of time, and recall the crowning
of Richard III. and the troublous days of that old forgotten age; and
there are handsome middle-aged dames; and lovely and gracious young
matrons; and gentle and beautiful young girls, with beaming eyes and
fresh complexions, who may possibly put on their jewelled coronets
awkwardly when the great time comes; for the matter will be new to them,
and their excitement will be a sore hindrance. Still, this may not
happen, for the hair of all these ladies has been arranged with a special
view to the swift and successful lodging of the crown in its place when
the signal comes.</p>

<p>We have seen that this massed array of peeresses is sown thick with
diamonds, and we also see that it is a marvellous spectacle&mdash;but now we
are about to be astonished in earnest. &nbsp;About nine, the clouds suddenly
break away and a shaft of sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere, and
drifts slowly along the ranks of ladies; and every rank it touches flames
into a dazzling splendour of many-coloured fires, and we tingle to our
finger-tips with the electric thrill that is shot through us by the
surprise and the beauty of the spectacle! &nbsp;Presently a special envoy from
some distant corner of the Orient, marching with the general body of
foreign ambassadors, crosses this bar of sunshine, and we catch our
breath, the glory that streams and flashes and palpitates about him is so
overpowering; for he is crusted from head to heel with gems, and his
slightest movement showers a dancing radiance all around him.</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Let us change the tense for convenience. &nbsp;The time drifted along&mdash;one
hour&mdash;two hours&mdash;two hours and a half; then the deep booming of artillery
told that the King and his grand procession had arrived at last; so the
waiting multitude rejoiced. &nbsp;All knew that a further delay must follow,
for the King must be prepared and robed for the solemn ceremony; but this
delay would be pleasantly occupied by the assembling of the peers of the
realm in their stately robes. &nbsp;These were conducted ceremoniously to
their seats, and their coronets placed conveniently at hand; and
meanwhile the multitude in the galleries were alive with interest, for
most of them were beholding for the first time, dukes, earls, and barons,
whose names had been historical for five hundred years. &nbsp;When all were
finally seated, the spectacle from the galleries and all coigns of
vantage was complete; a gorgeous one to look upon and to remember.</p>

<p>Now the robed and mitred great heads of the church, and their attendants,
filed in upon the platform and took their appointed places; these were
followed by the Lord Protector and other great officials, and these again
by a steel-clad detachment of the Guard.</p>

<p>There was a waiting pause; then, at a signal, a triumphant peal of music
burst forth, and Tom Canty, clothed in a long robe of cloth of gold,
appeared at a door, and stepped upon the platform. &nbsp;The entire multitude
rose, and the ceremony of the Recognition ensued.</p>

<p>Then a noble anthem swept the Abbey with its rich waves of sound; and
thus heralded and welcomed, Tom Canty was conducted to the throne. &nbsp;The
ancient ceremonies went on, with impressive solemnity, whilst the
audience gazed; and as they drew nearer and nearer to completion, Tom
Canty grew pale, and still paler, and a deep and steadily deepening woe
and despondency settled down upon his spirits and upon his remorseful
heart.</p>

<p>At last the final act was at hand. &nbsp;The Archbishop of Canterbury lifted
up the crown of England from its cushion and held it out over the
trembling mock-King's head. &nbsp;In the same instant a rainbow-radiance
flashed along the spacious transept; for with one impulse every
individual in the great concourse of nobles lifted a coronet and poised
it over his or her head&mdash;and paused in that attitude.</p>

<p>A deep hush pervaded the Abbey. &nbsp;At this impressive moment, a startling
apparition intruded upon the scene&mdash;an apparition observed by none in the
absorbed multitude, until it suddenly appeared, moving up the great
central aisle. &nbsp;It was a boy, bareheaded, ill shod, and clothed in coarse
plebeian garments that were falling to rags. &nbsp;He raised his hand with a
solemnity which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect, and
delivered this note of warning&mdash;</p>

<p>"I forbid you to set the crown of England upon that forfeited head. &nbsp;I am
the King!"</p>

<p>In an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy; but in the
same instant Tom Canty, in his regal vestments, made a swift step
forward, and cried out in a ringing voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Loose him and forbear! &nbsp;He IS the King!"</p>

<p>A sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage, and they partly
rose in their places and stared in a bewildered way at one another and at
the chief figures in this scene, like persons who wondered whether they
were awake and in their senses, or asleep and dreaming. &nbsp;The Lord
Protector was as amazed as the rest, but quickly recovered himself, and
exclaimed in a voice of authority&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mind not his Majesty, his malady is upon him again&mdash;seize the vagabond!"</p>

<p>He would have been obeyed, but the mock-King stamped his foot and cried
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"On your peril! &nbsp;Touch him not, he is the King!"</p>

<p>The hands were withheld; a paralysis fell upon the house; no one moved,
no one spoke; indeed, no one knew how to act or what to say, in so
strange and surprising an emergency. &nbsp;While all minds were struggling to
right themselves, the boy still moved steadily forward, with high port
and confident mien; he had never halted from the beginning; and while the
tangled minds still floundered helplessly, he stepped upon the platform,
and the mock-King ran with a glad face to meet him; and fell on his knees
before him and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord the King, let poor Tom Canty be first to swear fealty to
thee, and say, 'Put on thy crown and enter into thine own again!'"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="32-370"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="32-370.jpg (121K)" src="images/32-370.jpg" height="553" width="708">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>The Lord Protector's eye fell sternly upon the new-comer's face; but
straightway the sternness vanished away, and gave place to an expression
of wondering surprise. &nbsp;This thing happened also to the other great
officers. &nbsp;They glanced at each other, and retreated a step by a common
and unconscious impulse. &nbsp;The thought in each mind was the same: &nbsp;"What a
strange resemblance!"</p>

<p>The Lord Protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity, then he said,
with grave respectfulness&mdash;</p>

<p>"By your favour, sir, I desire to ask certain questions which&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will answer them, my lord."</p>

<p>The Duke asked him many questions about the Court, the late King, the
prince, the princesses&mdash;the boy answered them correctly and without
hesitating. &nbsp;He described the rooms of state in the palace, the late
King's apartments, and those of the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>It was strange; it was wonderful; yes, it was unaccountable&mdash;so all said
that heard it. &nbsp;The tide was beginning to turn, and Tom Canty's hopes to
run high, when the Lord Protector shook his head and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is true it is most wonderful&mdash;but it is no more than our lord the
King likewise can do." &nbsp;This remark, and this reference to himself as
still the King, saddened Tom Canty, and he felt his hopes crumbling from
under him. &nbsp;"These are not PROOFS," added the Protector.</p>

<p>The tide was turning very fast now, very fast indeed&mdash;but in the wrong
direction; it was leaving poor Tom Canty stranded on the throne, and
sweeping the other out to sea. &nbsp;The Lord Protector communed with
himself&mdash;shook his head&mdash;the thought forced itself upon him, "It is perilous to
the State and to us all, to entertain so fateful a riddle as this; it
could divide the nation and undermine the throne." &nbsp;He turned and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Thomas, arrest this&mdash;No, hold!" &nbsp;His face lighted, and he confronted
the ragged candidate with this question&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where lieth the Great Seal? &nbsp;Answer me this truly, and the riddle is
unriddled; for only he that was Prince of Wales CAN so answer! On so
trivial a thing hang a throne and a dynasty!"</p>

<p>It was a lucky thought, a happy thought. &nbsp;That it was so considered by
the great officials was manifested by the silent applause that shot from
eye to eye around their circle in the form of bright approving glances.
Yes, none but the true prince could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the
vanished Great Seal&mdash;this forlorn little impostor had been taught his
lesson well, but here his teachings must fail, for his teacher himself
could not answer THAT question&mdash;ah, very good, very good indeed; now we
shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business in short order!
And so they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly with satisfaction, and
looked to see this foolish lad stricken with a palsy of guilty confusion.
How surprised they were, then, to see nothing of the sort happen&mdash;how
they marvelled to hear him answer up promptly, in a confident and
untroubled voice, and say&mdash;</p>

<br><br>
<a name="32-373"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="32-373.jpg (201K)" src="images/32-373.jpg" height="1035" width="762">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"There is nought in this riddle that is difficult." &nbsp;Then, without so
much as a by-your-leave to anybody, he turned and gave this command, with
the easy manner of one accustomed to doing such things: "My Lord St.
John, go you to my private cabinet in the palace&mdash;for none knoweth the
place better than you&mdash;and, close down to the floor, in the left corner
remotest from the door that opens from the ante-chamber, you shall find
in the wall a brazen nail-head; press upon it and a little jewel-closet
will fly open which not even you do know of&mdash;no, nor any soul else in
all the world but me and the trusty artisan that did contrive it for me.
The first thing that falleth under your eye will be the Great Seal&mdash;fetch
it hither."</p>

<p>All the company wondered at this speech, and wondered still more to see
the little mendicant pick out this peer without hesitancy or apparent
fear of mistake, and call him by name with such a placidly convincing air
of having known him all his life. &nbsp;The peer was almost surprised into
obeying. &nbsp;He even made a movement as if to go, but quickly recovered his
tranquil attitude and confessed his blunder with a blush. &nbsp;Tom Canty
turned upon him and said, sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why dost thou hesitate? &nbsp;Hast not heard the King's command? &nbsp;Go!"</p>

<p>The Lord St. John made a deep obeisance&mdash;and it was observed that it was
a significantly cautious and non-committal one, it not being delivered at
either of the kings, but at the neutral ground about half-way between the
two&mdash;and took his leave.</p>

<p>Now began a movement of the gorgeous particles of that official group
which was slow, scarcely perceptible, and yet steady and persistent&mdash;a
movement such as is observed in a kaleidoscope that is turned slowly,
whereby the components of one splendid cluster fall away and join
themselves to another&mdash;a movement which, little by little, in the present
case, dissolved the glittering crowd that stood about Tom Canty and
clustered it together again in the neighbourhood of the new-comer. &nbsp;Tom
Canty stood almost alone. Now ensued a brief season of deep suspense and
waiting&mdash;during which even the few faint hearts still remaining near Tom
Canty gradually scraped together courage enough to glide, one by one,
over to the majority. &nbsp;So at last Tom Canty, in his royal robes and
jewels, stood wholly alone and isolated from the world, a conspicuous
figure, occupying an eloquent vacancy.</p>

<p>Now the Lord St. John was seen returning. &nbsp;As he advanced up the
mid-aisle the interest was so intense that the low murmur of conversation in
the great assemblage died out and was succeeded by a profound hush, a
breathless stillness, through which his footfalls pulsed with a dull and
distant sound. &nbsp;Every eye was fastened upon him as he moved along. &nbsp;He
reached the platform, paused a moment, then moved toward Tom Canty with a
deep obeisance, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sire, the Seal is not there!"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="32-375"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="32-375.jpg (77K)" src="images/32-375.jpg" height="392" width="733">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>A mob does not melt away from the presence of a plague-patient with more
haste than the band of pallid and terrified courtiers melted away from
the presence of the shabby little claimant of the Crown. &nbsp;In a moment he
stood all alone, without friend or supporter, a target upon which was
concentrated a bitter fire of scornful and angry looks. &nbsp;The Lord
Protector called out fiercely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Cast the beggar into the street, and scourge him through the town&mdash;the
paltry knave is worth no more consideration!"</p>

<p>Officers of the guard sprang forward to obey, but Tom Canty waved them
off and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Back! &nbsp;Whoso touches him perils his life!"</p>

<p>The Lord Protector was perplexed in the last degree. &nbsp;He said to the Lord
St. John&mdash;</p>

<p>"Searched you well?&mdash;but it boots not to ask that. &nbsp;It doth seem passing
strange. &nbsp;Little things, trifles, slip out of one's ken, and one does not
think it matter for surprise; but how so bulky a thing as the Seal of
England can vanish away and no man be able to get track of it again&mdash;a
massy golden disk&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom Canty, with beaming eyes, sprang forward and shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold, that is enough! &nbsp;Was it round?&mdash;and thick?&mdash;and had it letters and
devices graved upon it?&mdash;yes? &nbsp;Oh, NOW I know what this Great Seal is
that there's been such worry and pother about. An' ye had described it to
me, ye could have had it three weeks ago. &nbsp;Right well I know where it
lies; but it was not I that put it there&mdash;first."</p>

<p>"Who, then, my liege?" asked the Lord Protector.</p>

<p>"He that stands there&mdash;the rightful King of England. &nbsp;And he shall tell
you himself where it lies&mdash;then you will believe he knew it of his own
knowledge. &nbsp;Bethink thee, my King&mdash;spur thy memory&mdash;it was the last, the
very LAST thing thou didst that day before thou didst rush forth from the
palace, clothed in my rags, to punish the soldier that insulted me."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="32-377"></a>
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>A silence ensued, undisturbed by a movement or a whisper, and all eyes
were fixed upon the new-comer, who stood, with bent head and corrugated
brow, groping in his memory among a thronging multitude of valueless
recollections for one single little elusive fact, which, found, would
seat him upon a throne&mdash;unfound, would leave him as he was, for good and
all&mdash;a pauper and an outcast. &nbsp;Moment after moment passed&mdash;the moments
built themselves into minutes&mdash;still the boy struggled silently on, and
gave no sign. &nbsp;But at last he heaved a sigh, shook his head slowly, and
said, with a trembling lip and in a despondent voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"I call the scene back&mdash;all of it&mdash;but the Seal hath no place in it." &nbsp;He
paused, then looked up, and said with gentle dignity, "My lords and
gentlemen, if ye will rob your rightful sovereign of his own for lack of
this evidence which he is not able to furnish, I may not stay ye, being
powerless. &nbsp;But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, folly, oh, madness, my King!" cried Tom Canty, in a panic,
"wait!&mdash;think! &nbsp;Do not give up!&mdash;the cause is not lost! &nbsp;Nor SHALL be, neither!
List to what I say&mdash;follow every word&mdash;I am going to bring that morning
back again, every hap just as it happened. &nbsp;We talked&mdash;I told you of my
sisters, Nan and Bet&mdash;ah, yes, you remember that; and about mine old
grandam&mdash;and the rough games of the lads of Offal Court&mdash;yes, you
remember these things also; very well, follow me still, you shall recall
everything. &nbsp;You gave me food and drink, and did with princely courtesy
send away the servants, so that my low breeding might not shame me before
them&mdash;ah, yes, this also you remember."</p>

<p>As Tom checked off his details, and the other boy nodded his head in
recognition of them, the great audience and the officials stared in
puzzled wonderment; the tale sounded like true history, yet how could
this impossible conjunction between a prince and a beggar-boy have come
about? &nbsp;Never was a company of people so perplexed, so interested, and so
stupefied, before.</p>

<p>"For a jest, my prince, we did exchange garments. &nbsp;Then we stood before a
mirror; and so alike were we that both said it seemed as if there had
been no change made&mdash;yes, you remember that. &nbsp;Then you noticed that the
soldier had hurt my hand&mdash;look! here it is, I cannot yet even write with
it, the fingers are so stiff. &nbsp;At this your Highness sprang up, vowing
vengeance upon that soldier, and ran towards the door&mdash;you passed a
table&mdash;that thing you call the Seal lay on that table&mdash;you snatched it up
and looked eagerly about, as if for a place to hide it&mdash;your eye caught
sight of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, 'tis sufficient!&mdash;and the good God be thanked!" exclaimed the
ragged claimant, in a mighty excitement. &nbsp;"Go, my good St. John&mdash;in an
arm-piece of the Milanese armour that hangs on the wall, thou'lt find the
Seal!"</p>

<p>"Right, my King! right!" cried Tom Canty; "NOW the sceptre of England is
thine own; and it were better for him that would dispute it that he had
been born dumb! &nbsp;Go, my Lord St. John, give thy feet wings!"</p>

<p>The whole assemblage was on its feet now, and well-nigh out of its mind
with uneasiness, apprehension, and consuming excitement. &nbsp;On the floor
and on the platform a deafening buzz of frantic conversation burst forth,
and for some time nobody knew anything or heard anything or was
interested in anything but what his neighbour was shouting into his ear,
or he was shouting into his neighbour's ear. &nbsp;Time&mdash;nobody knew how much
of it&mdash;swept by unheeded and unnoted. &nbsp;At last a sudden hush fell upon
the house, and in the same moment St. John appeared upon the platform,
and held the Great Seal aloft in his hand. &nbsp;Then such a shout went up&mdash;</p>

<p>"Long live the true King!"</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>For five minutes the air quaked with shouts and the crash of musical
instruments, and was white with a storm of waving handkerchiefs; and
through it all a ragged lad, the most conspicuous figure in England,
stood, flushed and happy and proud, in the centre of the spacious
platform, with the great vassals of the kingdom kneeling around him.</p>

<p>Then all rose, and Tom Canty cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, O my King, take these regal garments back, and give poor Tom, thy
servant, his shreds and remnants again."</p>

<p>The Lord Protector spoke up&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let the small varlet be stripped and flung into the Tower."</p>

<p>But the new King, the true King, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will not have it so. &nbsp;But for him I had not got my crown again&mdash;none
shall lay a hand upon him to harm him. &nbsp;And as for thee, my good uncle,
my Lord Protector, this conduct of thine is not grateful toward this poor
lad, for I hear he hath made thee a duke"&mdash;the Protector blushed&mdash;"yet he
was not a king; wherefore what is thy fine title worth now? &nbsp;To-morrow
you shall sue to me, THROUGH HIM, for its confirmation, else no duke, but
a simple earl, shalt thou remain."</p>

<p>Under this rebuke, his Grace the Duke of Somerset retired a little from
the front for the moment. &nbsp;The King turned to Tom, and said kindly&mdash;"My
poor boy, how was it that you could remember where I hid the Seal when I
could not remember it myself?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my King, that was easy, since I used it divers days."</p>

<p>"Used it&mdash;yet could not explain where it was?"</p>

<p>"I did not know it was THAT they wanted. &nbsp;They did not describe it, your
Majesty."</p>

<p>"Then how used you it?"</p>

<p>The red blood began to steal up into Tom's cheeks, and he dropped his
eyes and was silent.</p>

<p>"Speak up, good lad, and fear nothing," said the King. &nbsp;"How used you the
Great Seal of England?"</p>

<p>Tom stammered a moment, in a pathetic confusion, then got it out&mdash;</p>

<p>"To crack nuts with!"</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Poor child, the avalanche of laughter that greeted this nearly swept him
off his feet. &nbsp;But if a doubt remained in any mind that Tom Canty was not
the King of England and familiar with the august appurtenances of
royalty, this reply disposed of it utterly.</p>

<p>Meantime the sumptuous robe of state had been removed from Tom's
shoulders to the King's, whose rags were effectually hidden from sight
under it. &nbsp;Then the coronation ceremonies were resumed; the true King was
anointed and the crown set upon his head, whilst cannon thundered the
news to the city, and all London seemed to rock with applause.</p>

<p>Chapter XXXIII. Edward as King.</p>

<p>Miles Hendon was picturesque enough before he got into the riot on London
Bridge&mdash;he was more so when he got out of it. &nbsp;He had but little money
when he got in, none at all when he got out. &nbsp;The pickpockets had
stripped him of his last farthing.</p>

<p>But no matter, so he found his boy. &nbsp;Being a soldier, he did not go at
his task in a random way, but set to work, first of all, to arrange his
campaign.</p>

<p>What would the boy naturally do? &nbsp;Where would he naturally go?
Well&mdash;argued Miles&mdash;he would naturally go to his former haunts, for that is the
instinct of unsound minds, when homeless and forsaken, as well as of
sound ones. &nbsp;Whereabouts were his former haunts? &nbsp;His rags, taken
together with the low villain who seemed to know him and who even claimed
to be his father, indicated that his home was in one or another of the
poorest and meanest districts of London. &nbsp;Would the search for him be
difficult, or long? &nbsp;No, it was likely to be easy and brief. &nbsp;He would
not hunt for the boy, he would hunt for a crowd; in the centre of a big
crowd or a little one, sooner or later, he should find his poor little
friend, sure; and the mangy mob would be entertaining itself with
pestering and aggravating the boy, who would be proclaiming himself King,
as usual. &nbsp;Then Miles Hendon would cripple some of those people, and
carry off his little ward, and comfort and cheer him with loving words,
and the two would never be separated any more.</p>

<p>So Miles started on his quest. &nbsp;Hour after hour he tramped through back
alleys and squalid streets, seeking groups and crowds, and finding no end
of them, but never any sign of the boy. &nbsp;This greatly surprised him, but
did not discourage him. &nbsp;To his notion, there was nothing the matter with
his plan of campaign; the only miscalculation about it was that the
campaign was becoming a lengthy one, whereas he had expected it to be
short.</p>

<p>When daylight arrived, at last, he had made many a mile, and canvassed
many a crowd, but the only result was that he was tolerably tired, rather
hungry and very sleepy. &nbsp;He wanted some breakfast, but there was no way
to get it. &nbsp;To beg for it did not occur to him; as to pawning his sword,
he would as soon have thought of parting with his honour; he could spare
some of his clothes&mdash;yes, but one could as easily find a customer for a
disease as for such clothes.</p>

<p>At noon he was still tramping&mdash;among the rabble which followed after the
royal procession, now; for he argued that this regal display would
attract his little lunatic powerfully. &nbsp;He followed the pageant through
all its devious windings about London, and all the way to Westminster and
the Abbey. &nbsp;He drifted here and there amongst the multitudes that were
massed in the vicinity for a weary long time, baffled and perplexed, and
finally wandered off, thinking, and trying to contrive some way to better
his plan of campaign. &nbsp;By-and-by, when he came to himself out of his
musings, he discovered that the town was far behind him and that the day
was growing old. &nbsp;He was near the river, and in the country; it was a
region of fine rural seats&mdash;not the sort of district to welcome clothes
like his.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="33-386"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="33-386.jpg (94K)" src="images/33-386.jpg" height="482" width="718">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>It was not at all cold; so he stretched himself on the ground in the lee
of a hedge to rest and think. &nbsp;Drowsiness presently began to settle upon
his senses; the faint and far-off boom of cannon was wafted to his ear,
and he said to himself, "The new King is crowned," and straightway fell
asleep. &nbsp;He had not slept or rested, before, for more than thirty hours.
He did not wake again until near the middle of the next morning.</p>

<p>He got up, lame, stiff, and half famished, washed himself in the river,
stayed his stomach with a pint or two of water, and trudged off toward
Westminster, grumbling at himself for having wasted so much time. &nbsp;Hunger
helped him to a new plan, now; he would try to get speech with old Sir
Humphrey Marlow and borrow a few marks, and&mdash;but that was enough of a
plan for the present; it would be time enough to enlarge it when this
first stage should be accomplished.</p>

<p>Toward eleven o'clock he approached the palace; and although a host of
showy people were about him, moving in the same direction, he was not
inconspicuous&mdash;his costume took care of that. &nbsp;He watched these people's
faces narrowly, hoping to find a charitable one whose possessor might be
willing to carry his name to the old lieutenant&mdash;as to trying to get into
the palace himself, that was simply out of the question.</p>

<p>Presently our whipping-boy passed him, then wheeled about and scanned his
figure well, saying to himself, "An' that is not the very vagabond his
Majesty is in such a worry about, then am I an ass&mdash;though belike I was
that before. &nbsp;He answereth the description to a rag&mdash;that God should make
two such would be to cheapen miracles by wasteful repetition. &nbsp;I would I
could contrive an excuse to speak with him."</p>

<p>Miles Hendon saved him the trouble; for he turned about, then, as a man
generally will when somebody mesmerises him by gazing hard at him from
behind; and observing a strong interest in the boy's eyes, he stepped
toward him and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have just come out from the palace; do you belong there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, your worship."</p>

<p>"Know you Sir Humphrey Marlow?"</p>

<p>The boy started, and said to himself, "Lord! mine old departed father!"
Then he answered aloud, "Right well, your worship."</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;is he within?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy; and added, to himself, "within his grave."</p>

<p>"Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say
a word in his ear?"</p>

<p>"I will despatch the business right willingly, fair sir."</p>

<p>"Then say Miles Hendon, son of Sir Richard, is here without&mdash;I shall be
greatly bounden to you, my good lad."</p>

<p>The boy looked disappointed. &nbsp;"The King did not name him so," he said to
himself; "but it mattereth not, this is his twin brother, and can give
his Majesty news of t'other Sir-Odds-and-Ends, I warrant." &nbsp;So he said to
Miles, "Step in there a moment, good sir, and wait till I bring you
word."</p>

<p>Hendon retired to the place indicated&mdash;it was a recess sunk in the palace
wall, with a stone bench in it&mdash;a shelter for sentinels in bad weather.
He had hardly seated himself when some halberdiers, in charge of an
officer, passed by. &nbsp;The officer saw him, halted his men, and commanded
Hendon to come forth. &nbsp;He obeyed, and was promptly arrested as a
suspicious character prowling within the precincts of the palace. &nbsp;Things
began to look ugly. &nbsp;Poor Miles was going to explain, but the officer
roughly silenced him, and ordered his men to disarm him and search him.</p>

<br><br>

<img alt="33-389.jpg (117K)" src="images/33-389.jpg" height="658" width="720">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"God of his mercy grant that they find somewhat," said poor Miles; "I
have searched enow, and failed, yet is my need greater than theirs."</p>

<p>Nothing was found but a document. &nbsp;The officer tore it open, and Hendon
smiled when he recognised the 'pot-hooks' made by his lost little friend
that black day at Hendon Hall. &nbsp;The officer's face grew dark as he read
the English paragraph, and Miles blenched to the opposite colour as he
listened.</p>

<p>"Another new claimant of the Crown!" cried the officer. &nbsp;"Verily they
breed like rabbits, to-day. &nbsp;Seize the rascal, men, and see ye keep him
fast whilst I convey this precious paper within and send it to the King."</p>

<p>He hurried away, leaving the prisoner in the grip of the halberdiers.</p>

<p>"Now is my evil luck ended at last," muttered Hendon, "for I shall dangle
at a rope's end for a certainty, by reason of that bit of writing. &nbsp;And
what will become of my poor lad!&mdash;ah, only the good God knoweth."</p>

<p>By-and-by he saw the officer coming again, in a great hurry; so he
plucked his courage together, purposing to meet his trouble as became a
man. &nbsp;The officer ordered the men to loose the prisoner and return his
sword to him; then bowed respectfully, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Please you, sir, to follow me."</p>

<p>Hendon followed, saying to himself, "An' I were not travelling to death
and judgment, and so must needs economise in sin, I would throttle this
knave for his mock courtesy."</p>

<p>The two traversed a populous court, and arrived at the grand entrance of
the palace, where the officer, with another bow, delivered Hendon into
the hands of a gorgeous official, who received him with profound respect
and led him forward through a great hall, lined on both sides with rows
of splendid flunkeys (who made reverential obeisance as the two passed
along, but fell into death-throes of silent laughter at our stately
scarecrow the moment his back was turned), and up a broad staircase,
among flocks of fine folk, and finally conducted him into a vast room,
clove a passage for him through the assembled nobility of England, then
made a bow, reminded him to take his hat off, and left him standing in
the middle of the room, a mark for all eyes, for plenty of indignant
frowns, and for a sufficiency of amused and derisive smiles.</p>

<p>Miles Hendon was entirely bewildered. &nbsp;There sat the young King, under a
canopy of state, five steps away, with his head bent down and aside,
speaking with a sort of human bird of paradise&mdash;a duke, maybe. &nbsp;Hendon
observed to himself that it was hard enough to be sentenced to death in
the full vigour of life, without having this peculiarly public
humiliation added. &nbsp;He wished the King would hurry about it&mdash;some of the
gaudy people near by were becoming pretty offensive. &nbsp;At this moment the
King raised his head slightly, and Hendon caught a good view of his face.
The sight nearly took his breath away!&mdash;He stood gazing at the fair young
face like one transfixed; then presently ejaculated&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lo, the Lord of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows on his throne!"</p>

<p>He muttered some broken sentences, still gazing and marvelling; then
turned his eyes around and about, scanning the gorgeous throng and the
splendid saloon, murmuring, "But these are REAL&mdash;verily these are
REAL&mdash;surely it is not a dream."</p>

<p>He stared at the King again&mdash;and thought, "IS it a dream . . . or IS he
the veritable Sovereign of England, and not the friendless poor Tom o'
Bedlam I took him for&mdash;who shall solve me this riddle?"</p>

<p>A sudden idea flashed in his eye, and he strode to the wall, gathered up
a chair, brought it back, planted it on the floor, and sat down in it!</p>

<br><br>

<img alt="33-392.jpg (184K)" src="images/33-392.jpg" height="1039" width="746">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>A buzz of indignation broke out, a rough hand was laid upon him and a
voice exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Up, thou mannerless clown! would'st sit in the presence of the King?"</p>

<p>The disturbance attracted his Majesty's attention, who stretched forth
his hand and cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Touch him not, it is his right!"</p>

<p>The throng fell back, stupefied. &nbsp;The King went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"Learn ye all, ladies, lords, and gentlemen, that this is my trusty and
well-beloved servant, Miles Hendon, who interposed his good sword and
saved his prince from bodily harm and possible death&mdash;and for this he is
a knight, by the King's voice. &nbsp;Also learn, that for a higher service, in
that he saved his sovereign stripes and shame, taking these upon himself,
he is a peer of England, Earl of Kent, and shall have gold and lands meet
for the dignity. &nbsp;More&mdash;the privilege which he hath just exercised is his
by royal grant; for we have ordained that the chiefs of his line shall
have and hold the right to sit in the presence of the Majesty of England
henceforth, age after age, so long as the crown shall endure. &nbsp;Molest him
not."</p>

<p>Two persons, who, through delay, had only arrived from the country during
this morning, and had now been in this room only five minutes, stood
listening to these words and looking at the King, then at the scarecrow,
then at the King again, in a sort of torpid bewilderment. &nbsp;These were Sir
Hugh and the Lady Edith. &nbsp;But the new Earl did not see them. &nbsp;He was
still staring at the monarch, in a dazed way, and muttering&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, body o' me! &nbsp;THIS my pauper! &nbsp;This my lunatic! &nbsp;This is he whom _I_
would show what grandeur was, in my house of seventy rooms and
seven-and-twenty servants! &nbsp;This is he who had never known aught but rags for
raiment, kicks for comfort, and offal for diet! &nbsp;This is he whom _I_
adopted and would make respectable! Would God I had a bag to hide my head
in!"</p>

<p>Then his manners suddenly came back to him, and he dropped upon his
knees, with his hands between the King's, and swore allegiance and did
homage for his lands and titles. &nbsp;Then he rose and stood respectfully
aside, a mark still for all eyes&mdash;and much envy, too.</p>

<p>Now the King discovered Sir Hugh, and spoke out with wrathful voice and
kindling eye&mdash;</p>

<p>"Strip this robber of his false show and stolen estates, and put him
under lock and key till I have need of him."</p>

<p>The late Sir Hugh was led away.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>There was a stir at the other end of the room, now; the assemblage fell
apart, and Tom Canty, quaintly but richly clothed, marched down, between
these living walls, preceded by an usher. &nbsp;He knelt before the King, who
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have learned the story of these past few weeks, and am well pleased
with thee. &nbsp;Thou hast governed the realm with right royal gentleness and
mercy. &nbsp;Thou hast found thy mother and thy sisters again? &nbsp;Good; they
shall be cared for&mdash;and thy father shall hang, if thou desire it and the
law consent. &nbsp;Know, all ye that hear my voice, that from this day, they
that abide in the shelter of Christ's Hospital and share the King's
bounty shall have their minds and hearts fed, as well as their baser
parts; and this boy shall dwell there, and hold the chief place in its
honourable body of governors, during life. &nbsp;And for that he hath been a
king, it is meet that other than common observance shall be his due;
wherefore note this his dress of state, for by it he shall be known, and
none shall copy it; and wheresoever he shall come, it shall remind the
people that he hath been royal, in his time, and none shall deny him his
due of reverence or fail to give him salutation. &nbsp;He hath the throne's
protection, he hath the crown's support, he shall be known and called by
the honourable title of the King's Ward."</p>

<p>The proud and happy Tom Canty rose and kissed the King's hand, and was
conducted from the presence. &nbsp;He did not waste any time, but flew to his
mother, to tell her and Nan and Bet all about it and get them to help him
enjoy the great news. {1}</p>

<p>Conclusion. Justice and retribution.</p>

<p>When the mysteries were all cleared up, it came out, by confession of
Hugh Hendon, that his wife had repudiated Miles by his command, that day
at Hendon Hall&mdash;a command assisted and supported by the perfectly
trustworthy promise that if she did not deny that he was Miles Hendon,
and stand firmly to it, he would have her life; whereupon she said, "Take
it!"&mdash;she did not value it&mdash;and she would not repudiate Miles; then the
husband said he would spare her life but have Miles assassinated! &nbsp;This
was a different matter; so she gave her word and kept it.</p>

<p>Hugh was not prosecuted for his threats or for stealing his brother's
estates and title, because the wife and brother would not testify against
him&mdash;and the former would not have been allowed to do it, even if she had
wanted to. &nbsp;Hugh deserted his wife and went over to the continent, where
he presently died; and by-and-by the Earl of Kent married his relict.
There were grand times and rejoicings at Hendon village when the couple
paid their first visit to the Hall.</p>

<p>Tom Canty's father was never heard of again.</p>

<p>The King sought out the farmer who had been branded and sold as a slave,
and reclaimed him from his evil life with the Ruffler's gang, and put him
in the way of a comfortable livelihood.</p>

<p>He also took that old lawyer out of prison and remitted his fine. He
provided good homes for the daughters of the two Baptist women whom he
saw burned at the stake, and roundly punished the official who laid the
undeserved stripes upon Miles Hendon's back.</p>

<p>He saved from the gallows the boy who had captured the stray falcon, and
also the woman who had stolen a remnant of cloth from a weaver; but he
was too late to save the man who had been convicted of killing a deer in
the royal forest.</p>

<p>He showed favour to the justice who had pitied him when he was supposed
to have stolen a pig, and he had the gratification of seeing him grow in
the public esteem and become a great and honoured man.</p>

<p>As long as the King lived he was fond of telling the story of his
adventures, all through, from the hour that the sentinel cuffed him away
from the palace gate till the final midnight when he deftly mixed himself
into a gang of hurrying workmen and so slipped into the Abbey and climbed
up and hid himself in the Confessor's tomb, and then slept so long, next
day, that he came within one of missing the Coronation altogether. &nbsp;He
said that the frequent rehearsing of the precious lesson kept him strong
in his purpose to make its teachings yield benefits to his people; and
so, whilst his life was spared he should continue to tell the story, and
thus keep its sorrowful spectacles fresh in his memory and the springs of
pity replenished in his heart.</p>

<p>Miles Hendon and Tom Canty were favourites of the King, all through his
brief reign, and his sincere mourners when he died. The good Earl of Kent
had too much sense to abuse his peculiar privilege; but he exercised it
twice after the instance we have seen of it before he was called from
this world&mdash;once at the accession of Queen Mary, and once at the
accession of Queen Elizabeth. &nbsp;A descendant of his exercised it at the
accession of James I. &nbsp;Before this one's son chose to use the privilege,
near a quarter of a century had elapsed, and the 'privilege of the Kents'
had faded out of most people's memories; so, when the Kent of that day
appeared before Charles I. and his court and sat down in the sovereign's
presence to assert and perpetuate the right of his house, there was a
fine stir indeed! &nbsp;But the matter was soon explained, and the right
confirmed. &nbsp;The last Earl of the line fell in the wars of the
Commonwealth fighting for the King, and the odd privilege ended with him.</p>

<p>Tom Canty lived to be a very old man, a handsome, white-haired old
fellow, of grave and benignant aspect. &nbsp;As long as he lasted he was
honoured; and he was also reverenced, for his striking and peculiar
costume kept the people reminded that 'in his time he had been royal;'
so, wherever he appeared the crowd fell apart, making way for him, and
whispering, one to another, "Doff thy hat, it is the King's Ward!"&mdash;and
so they saluted, and got his kindly smile in return&mdash;and they valued it,
too, for his was an honourable history.</p>

<p>Yes, King Edward VI. lived only a few years, poor boy, but he lived them
worthily. &nbsp;More than once, when some great dignitary, some gilded vassal
of the crown, made argument against his leniency, and urged that some law
which he was bent upon amending was gentle enough for its purpose, and
wrought no suffering or oppression which any one need mightily mind, the
young King turned the mournful eloquence of his great compassionate eyes
upon him and answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"What dost THOU know of suffering and oppression? &nbsp;I and my people know,
but not thou."</p>

<p>The reign of Edward VI. was a singularly merciful one for those harsh
times. &nbsp;Now that we are taking leave of him, let us try to keep this in
our minds, to his credit.</p>

minores, as distinct from the parliamentary barons&mdash;not, it need hardly
be said, to the baronets of later creation.</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTE 1, Chapter IV. Christ's Hospital Costume.</p>

<p>It is most reasonable to regard the dress as copied from the costume of
the citizens of London of that period, when long blue coats were the
common habit of apprentices and serving-men, and yellow stockings were
generally worn; the coat fits closely to the body, but has loose sleeves,
and beneath is worn a sleeveless yellow under-coat; around the waist is a
red leathern girdle; a clerical band around the neck, and a small flat
black cap, about the size of a saucer, completes the costume.&mdash;Timbs'
Curiosities of London.</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTE 2, Chapter IV.</p>

<p>It appears that Christ's Hospital was not originally founded as a SCHOOL;
its object was to rescue children from the streets, to shelter, feed,
clothe them.&mdash;Timbs' Curiosities of London.</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTE 3, Chapter V. The Duke of Norfolk's Condemnation commanded.</p>

<p>The King was now approaching fast towards his end; and fearing lest
Norfolk should escape him, he sent a message to the Commons, by which he
desired them to hasten the Bill, on pretence that Norfolk enjoyed the
dignity of Earl Marshal, and it was necessary to appoint another, who
might officiate at the ensuing ceremony of installing his son Prince of
Wales.&mdash;Hume's History of England, vol. iii. p. 307.</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTE 4, Chapter VII.</p>

<p>It was not till the end of this reign (Henry VIII.) that any salads,
carrots, turnips, or other edible roots were produced in England. &nbsp;The
little of these vegetables that was used was formerly imported from
Holland and Flanders. &nbsp;Queen Catherine, when she wanted a salad, was
obliged to despatch a messenger thither on purpose.&mdash;Hume's History of
England, vol. iii. p. 314.</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTE 5, Chapter VIII. Attainder of Norfolk.</p>

<p>The House of Peers, without examining the prisoner, without trial or
evidence, passed a Bill of Attainder against him and sent it down to the
Commons . . . The obsequious Commons obeyed his (the King's) directions;
and the King, having affixed the Royal assent to the Bill by
commissioners, issued orders for the execution of Norfolk on the morning
of January 29 (the next day).&mdash;Hume's History of England, vol iii. p 306.</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTE 6, Chapter X. The Loving-cup.</p>

<p>The loving-cup, and the peculiar ceremonies observed in drinking from it,
are older than English history. &nbsp;It is thought that both are Danish
importations. &nbsp;As far back as knowledge goes, the loving-cup has always
been drunk at English banquets. &nbsp;Tradition explains the ceremonies in
this way. &nbsp;In the rude ancient times it was deemed a wise precaution to
have both hands of both drinkers employed, lest while the pledger pledged
his love and fidelity to the pledgee, the pledgee take that opportunity
to slip a dirk into him!</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTE 7, Chapter XI. The Duke of Norfolk's narrow Escape.</p>

<p>Had Henry VIII. survived a few hours longer, his order for the duke's
execution would have been carried into effect. 'But news being carried to
the Tower that the King himself had expired that night, the lieutenant
deferred obeying the warrant; and it was not thought advisable by the
Council to begin a new reign by the death of the greatest nobleman in the
kingdom, who had been condemned by a sentence so unjust and
tyrannical.'&mdash;Hume's History of England, vol. iii, p. 307.</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTE 8, Chapter XIV. The Whipping-boy.</p>

<p>James I. and Charles II. had whipping-boys, when they were little
fellows, to take their punishment for them when they fell short in their
lessons; so I have ventured to furnish my small prince with one, for my
own purposes.</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTES to Chapter XV.</p>

<p>Character of Hertford.</p>

<p>The young King discovered an extreme attachment to his uncle, who was, in
the main, a man of moderation and probity.&mdash;Hume's History of England,
vol. iii, p324.</p>

<p>But if he (the Protector) gave offence by assuming too much state, he
deserves great praise on account of the laws passed this session, by
which the rigour of former statutes was much mitigated, and some security
given to the freedom of the constitution. &nbsp;All laws were repealed which
extended the crime of treason beyond the statute of the twenty-fifth of
Edward III.; all laws enacted during the late reign extending the crime
of felony; all the former laws against Lollardy or heresy, together with
the statute of the Six Articles. &nbsp;None were to be accused for words, but
within a month after they were spoken. &nbsp;By these repeals several of the
most rigorous laws that ever had passed in England were annulled; and
some dawn, both of civil and religious liberty, began to appear to the
people. &nbsp;A repeal also passed of that law, the destruction of all laws,
by which the King's proclamation was made of equal force with a statute.
&mdash;Ibid. vol. iii. p. 339.</p>

<p>Boiling to Death.</p>

<p>In the reign of Henry VIII. poisoners were, by Act of Parliament,
condemned to be BOILED TO DEATH. &nbsp;This Act was repealed in the following
reign.</p>

<p>In Germany, even in the seventeenth century, this horrible punishment was
inflicted on coiners and counterfeiters. &nbsp;Taylor, the Water Poet,
describes an execution he witnessed in Hamburg in 1616. &nbsp;The judgment
pronounced against a coiner of false money was that he should 'BE BOILED
TO DEATH IN OIL; not thrown into the vessel at once, but with a pulley or
rope to be hanged under the armpits, and then let down into the oil BY
DEGREES; first the feet, and next the legs, and so to boil his flesh from
his bones alive.'&mdash;Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull's Blue Laws, True and False,
p. 13.</p>

<p>The Famous Stocking Case.</p>

<p>A woman and her daughter, NINE YEARS OLD, were hanged in Huntingdon for
selling their souls to the devil, and raising a storm by pulling off
their stockings!&mdash;Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull's Blue Laws, True and False, p.
20.</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTE 10, Chapter XVII. Enslaving.</p>

<p>So young a King and so ignorant a peasant were likely to make mistakes;
and this is an instance in point. &nbsp;This peasant was suffering from this
law BY ANTICIPATION; the King was venting his indignation against a law
which was not yet in existence; for this hideous statute was to have
birth in this little King's OWN REIGN. However, we know, from the
humanity of his character, that it could never have been suggested by
him.</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTES to Chapter XXIII. Death for Trifling Larcenies.</p>

<p>When Connecticut and New Haven were framing their first codes, larceny
above the value of twelve pence was a capital crime in England&mdash;as it had
been since the time of Henry I.&mdash;Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull's Blue Laws,
True and False, p. 17.</p>

<p>The curious old book called The English Rogue makes the limit thirteen
pence ha'penny: &nbsp;death being the portion of any who steal a thing 'above
the value of thirteen pence ha'penny.'</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTES to Chapter XXVII.</p>

<p>From many descriptions of larceny the law expressly took away the benefit
of clergy: &nbsp;to steal a horse, or a HAWK, or woollen cloth from the
weaver, was a hanging matter. &nbsp;So it was to kill a deer from the King's
forest, or to export sheep from the kingdom.&mdash;Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull's
Blue Laws, True and False, p.13.</p>

<p>William Prynne, a learned barrister, was sentenced (long after Edward
VI.'s time) to lose both his ears in the pillory, to degradation from the
bar, a fine of 3,000 pounds, and imprisonment for life. &nbsp;Three years
afterwards he gave new offence to Laud by publishing a pamphlet against
the hierarchy. &nbsp;He was again prosecuted, and was sentenced to lose WHAT
REMAINED OF HIS EARS, to pay a fine of 5,000 pounds, to be BRANDED ON
BOTH HIS CHEEKS with the letters S. L. (for Seditious Libeller), and to
remain in prison for life. &nbsp;The severity of this sentence was equalled by
the savage rigour of its execution.&mdash;Ibid. p. 12.</p>

<p><br><br><br>NOTES to Chapter XXXIII.</p>

<p>Christ's Hospital, or Bluecoat School, 'the noblest institution in the
world.'</p>

<p>The ground on which the Priory of the Grey Friars stood was conferred by
Henry VIII. on the Corporation of London (who caused the institution
there of a home for poor boys and girls). Subsequently, Edward VI. caused
the old Priory to be properly repaired, and founded within it that noble
establishment called the Bluecoat School, or Christ's Hospital, for the
EDUCATION and maintenance of orphans and the children of indigent persons
. . . Edward would not let him (Bishop Ridley) depart till the letter was
written (to the Lord Mayor), and then charged him to deliver it himself,
and signify his special request and commandment that no time might be
lost in proposing what was convenient, and apprising him of the
proceedings. &nbsp;The work was zealously undertaken, Ridley himself engaging
in it; and the result was the founding of Christ's Hospital for the
education of poor children. (The King endowed several other charities at
the same time.) "Lord God," said he, "I yield Thee most hearty thanks
that Thou hast given me life thus long to finish this work to the glory
of Thy name!" &nbsp;That innocent and most exemplary life was drawing rapidly
to its close, and in a few days he rendered up his spirit to his Creator,
praying God to defend the realm from Papistry.&mdash;J. Heneage Jesse's
London: &nbsp;its Celebrated Characters and Places.</p>

<p>In the Great Hall hangs a large picture of King Edward VI. seated on his
throne, in a scarlet and ermined robe, holding the sceptre in his left
hand, and presenting with the other the Charter to the kneeling Lord
Mayor. &nbsp;By his side stands the Chancellor, holding the seals, and next to
him are other officers of state. &nbsp;Bishop Ridley kneels before him with
uplifted hands, as if supplicating a blessing on the event; whilst the
Aldermen, etc., with the Lord Mayor, kneel on both sides, occupying the
middle ground of the picture; and lastly, in front, are a double row of
boys on one side and girls on the other, from the master and matron down
to the boy and girl who have stepped forward from their respective rows,
and kneel with raised hands before the King.&mdash;Timbs' Curiosities of
London, p. 98.</p>

<p>Christ's Hospital, by ancient custom, possesses the privilege of
addressing the Sovereign on the occasion of his or her coming into the
City to partake of the hospitality of the Corporation of London.&mdash;Ibid.</p>

<p>The Dining Hall, with its lobby and organ-gallery, occupies the entire
storey, which is 187 feet long, 51 feet wide, and 47 feet high; it is lit
by nine large windows, filled with stained glass on the south side; and
is, next to Westminster Hall, the noblest room in the metropolis. &nbsp;Here
the boys, now about 800 in number, dine; and here are held the 'Suppings
in Public,' to which visitors are admitted by tickets issued by the
Treasurer and by the Governors of Christ's Hospital. &nbsp;The tables are laid
with cheese in wooden bowls, beer in wooden piggins, poured from leathern
jacks, and bread brought in large baskets. &nbsp;The official company enter;
the Lord Mayor, or President, takes his seat in a state chair made of oak
from St. Catherine's Church, by the Tower; a hymn is sung, accompanied by
the organ; a 'Grecian,' or head boy, reads the prayers from the pulpit,
silence being enforced by three drops of a wooden hammer. &nbsp;After prayer
the supper commences, and the visitors walk between the tables. &nbsp;At its
close the 'trade-boys' take up the baskets, bowls, jacks, piggins, and
candlesticks, and pass in procession, the bowing to the Governors being
curiously formal. &nbsp;This spectacle was witnessed by Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert in 1845.</p>

<p>Among the more eminent Bluecoat boys are Joshua Barnes, editor of
Anacreon and Euripides; Jeremiah Markland, the eminent critic,
particularly in Greek Literature; Camden, the antiquary; Bishop
Stillingfleet; Samuel Richardson, the novelist; Thomas Mitchell, the
translator of Aristophanes; Thomas Barnes, many years editor of the
London Times; Coleridge, Charles Lamb, and Leigh Hunt.</p>

<p>No boy is admitted before he is seven years old, or after he is nine; and
no boy can remain in the school after he is fifteen, King's boys and
'Grecians' alone excepted. &nbsp;There are about 500 Governors, at the head of
whom are the Sovereign and the Prince of Wales. &nbsp;The qualification for a
Governor is payment of 500 pounds.&mdash;Ibid.</p>

<p>
GENERAL NOTE.</p>

<p>
One hears much about the 'hideous Blue Laws of Connecticut,' and is
accustomed to shudder piously when they are mentioned. &nbsp;There are people
in America&mdash;and even in England!&mdash;who imagine that they were a very
monument of malignity, pitilessness, and inhumanity; whereas in reality
they were about the first SWEEPING DEPARTURE FROM JUDICIAL ATROCITY which
the 'civilised' world had seen. &nbsp;This humane and kindly Blue Law Code, of
two hundred and forty years ago, stands all by itself, with ages of
bloody law on the further side of it, and a century and three-quarters of
bloody English law on THIS side of it.</p>

<p>There has never been a time&mdash;under the Blue Laws or any other&mdash;when above
FOURTEEN crimes were punishable by death in Connecticut. &nbsp;But in England,
within the memory of men who are still hale in body and mind, TWO HUNDRED
AND TWENTY-THREE crimes were punishable by death! {10} &nbsp;These facts are
worth knowing&mdash;and worth thinking about, too.</p>
