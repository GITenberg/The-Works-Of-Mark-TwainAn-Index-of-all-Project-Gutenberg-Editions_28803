<p>Chapter XV. Tom as King.</p>

<p>The next day the foreign ambassadors came, with their gorgeous trains;
and Tom, throned in awful state, received them. &nbsp;The splendours of the
scene delighted his eye and fired his imagination at first, but the
audience was long and dreary, and so were most of the
addresses&mdash;wherefore, what began as a pleasure grew into weariness and home-sickness
by-and-by. &nbsp;Tom said the words which Hertford put into his mouth from
time to time, and tried hard to acquit himself satisfactorily, but he was
too new to such things, and too ill at ease to accomplish more than a
tolerable success. &nbsp;He looked sufficiently like a king, but he was ill
able to feel like one. &nbsp;He was cordially glad when the ceremony was
ended.</p>

<p>The larger part of his day was 'wasted'&mdash;as he termed it, in his own
mind&mdash;in labours pertaining to his royal office. &nbsp;Even the two hours
devoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were rather a burden
to him than otherwise, they were so fettered by restrictions and
ceremonious observances. &nbsp;However, he had a private hour with his
whipping-boy which he counted clear gain, since he got both entertainment
and needful information out of it.</p>

<p>The third day of Tom Canty's kingship came and went much as the others
had done, but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way&mdash;he felt less
uncomfortable than at first; he was getting a little used to his
circumstances and surroundings; his chains still galled, but not all the
time; he found that the presence and homage of the great afflicted and
embarrassed him less and less sharply with every hour that drifted over
his head.</p>

<p>But for one single dread, he could have seen the fourth day approach
without serious distress&mdash;the dining in public; it was to begin that day.
There were greater matters in the programme&mdash;for on that day he would
have to preside at a council which would take his views and commands
concerning the policy to be pursued toward various foreign nations
scattered far and near over the great globe; on that day, too, Hertford
would be formally chosen to the grand office of Lord Protector; other
things of note were appointed for that fourth day, also; but to Tom they
were all insignificant compared with the ordeal of dining all by himself
with a multitude of curious eyes fastened upon him and a multitude of
mouths whispering comments upon his performance,&mdash;and upon his mistakes,
if he should be so unlucky as to make any.</p>

<p>Still, nothing could stop that fourth day, and so it came. &nbsp;It found poor
Tom low-spirited and absent-minded, and this mood continued; he could not
shake it off. &nbsp;The ordinary duties of the morning dragged upon his hands,
and wearied him. &nbsp;Once more he felt the sense of captivity heavy upon
him.</p>

<p>Late in the forenoon he was in a large audience-chamber, conversing with
the Earl of Hertford and dully awaiting the striking of the hour
appointed for a visit of ceremony from a considerable number of great
officials and courtiers.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="15-181"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="15-181.jpg (53K)" src="images/15-181.jpg" height="659" width="297">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>After a little while, Tom, who had wandered to a window and become
interested in the life and movement of the great highway beyond the
palace gates&mdash;and not idly interested, but longing with all his heart to
take part in person in its stir and freedom&mdash;saw the van of a hooting and
shouting mob of disorderly men, women, and children of the lowest and
poorest degree approaching from up the road.</p>

<p>"I would I knew what 'tis about!" he exclaimed, with all a boy's
curiosity in such happenings.</p>

<p>"Thou art the King!" solemnly responded the Earl, with a reverence.
"Have I your Grace's leave to act?"</p>

<p>"O blithely, yes! &nbsp;O gladly, yes!" exclaimed Tom excitedly, adding to
himself with a lively sense of satisfaction, "In truth, being a king is
not all dreariness&mdash;it hath its compensations and conveniences."</p>

<p>The Earl called a page, and sent him to the captain of the guard with the
order&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let the mob be halted, and inquiry made concerning the occasion of its
movement. &nbsp;By the King's command!"</p>

<p>A few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards, cased in flashing
steel, filed out at the gates and formed across the highway in front of
the multitude. &nbsp;A messenger returned, to report that the crowd were
following a man, a woman, and a young girl to execution for crimes
committed against the peace and dignity of the realm.</p>

<p>Death&mdash;and a violent death&mdash;for these poor unfortunates! &nbsp;The thought
wrung Tom's heart-strings. &nbsp;The spirit of compassion took control of him,
to the exclusion of all other considerations; he never thought of the
offended laws, or of the grief or loss which these three criminals had
inflicted upon their victims; he could think of nothing but the scaffold
and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned. &nbsp;His concern
made him even forget, for the moment, that he was but the false shadow of
a king, not the substance; and before he knew it he had blurted out the
command&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bring them here!"</p>

<p>Then he blushed scarlet, and a sort of apology sprung to his lips; but
observing that his order had wrought no sort of surprise in the Earl or
the waiting page, he suppressed the words he was about to utter. &nbsp;The
page, in the most matter-of-course way, made a profound obeisance and
retired backwards out of the room to deliver the command. &nbsp;Tom
experienced a glow of pride and a renewed sense of the compensating
advantages of the kingly office. He said to himself, "Truly it is like
what I was used to feel when I read the old priest's tales, and did
imagine mine own self a prince, giving law and command to all, saying 'Do
this, do that,' whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my will."</p>

<p>Now the doors swung open; one high-sounding title after another was
announced, the personages owning them followed, and the place was quickly
half-filled with noble folk and finery. &nbsp;But Tom was hardly conscious of
the presence of these people, so wrought up was he and so intensely
absorbed in that other and more interesting matter. &nbsp;He seated himself
absently in his chair of state, and turned his eyes upon the door with
manifestations of impatient expectancy; seeing which, the company forbore
to trouble him, and fell to chatting a mixture of public business and
court gossip one with another.</p>

<p>In a little while the measured tread of military men was heard
approaching, and the culprits entered the presence in charge of an
under-sheriff and escorted by a detail of the king's guard. &nbsp;The civil officer
knelt before Tom, then stood aside; the three doomed persons knelt, also,
and remained so; the guard took position behind Tom's chair. &nbsp;Tom scanned
the prisoners curiously. Something about the dress or appearance of the
man had stirred a vague memory in him. &nbsp;"Methinks I have seen this man
ere now . . . but the when or the where fail me."&mdash;Such was Tom's thought.
Just then the man glanced quickly up and quickly dropped his face again,
not being able to endure the awful port of sovereignty; but the one full
glimpse of the face which Tom got was sufficient. &nbsp;He said to himself:
"Now is the matter clear; this is the stranger that plucked Giles Witt
out of the Thames, and saved his life, that windy, bitter, first day of
the New Year&mdash;a brave good deed&mdash;pity he hath been doing baser ones and
got himself in this sad case . . . I have not forgot the day, neither the
hour; by reason that an hour after, upon the stroke of eleven, I did get
a hiding by the hand of Gammer Canty which was of so goodly and admired
severity that all that went before or followed after it were but
fondlings and caresses by comparison."</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Tom now ordered that the woman and the girl be removed from the presence
for a little time; then addressed himself to the under-sheriff, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good sir, what is this man's offence?"</p>

<p>The officer knelt, and answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"So please your Majesty, he hath taken the life of a subject by poison."</p>

<p>Tom's compassion for the prisoner, and admiration of him as the daring
rescuer of a drowning boy, experienced a most damaging shock.</p>

<p>"The thing was proven upon him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Most clearly, sire."</p>

<p>Tom sighed, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Take him away&mdash;he hath earned his death. &nbsp;'Tis a pity, for he was a
brave heart&mdash;na&mdash;na, I mean he hath the LOOK of it!"</p>

<p>The prisoner clasped his hands together with sudden energy, and wrung
them despairingly, at the same time appealing imploringly to the 'King'
in broken and terrified phrases&mdash;</p>

<p>"O my lord the King, an' thou canst pity the lost, have pity upon me! &nbsp;I
am innocent&mdash;neither hath that wherewith I am charged been more than but
lamely proved&mdash;yet I speak not of that; the judgment is gone forth
against me and may not suffer alteration; yet in mine extremity I beg a
boon, for my doom is more than I can bear. A grace, a grace, my lord the
King! in thy royal compassion grant my prayer&mdash;give commandment that I be
hanged!"</p>

<p>Tom was amazed. &nbsp;This was not the outcome he had looked for.</p>

<p>"Odds my life, a strange BOON! &nbsp;Was it not the fate intended thee?"</p>

<p>"O good my liege, not so! &nbsp;It is ordered that I be BOILED ALIVE!"</p>

<p>The hideous surprise of these words almost made Tom spring from his
chair. &nbsp;As soon as he could recover his wits he cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have thy wish, poor soul! an' thou had poisoned a hundred men thou
shouldst not suffer so miserable a death."</p>

<p>The prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into passionate
expressions of gratitude&mdash;ending with&mdash;</p>

<p>"If ever thou shouldst know misfortune&mdash;which God forefend!&mdash;may thy
goodness to me this day be remembered and requited!"</p>

<p>Tom turned to the Earl of Hertford, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My lord, is it believable that there was warrant for this man's
ferocious doom?"</p>

<p>"It is the law, your Grace&mdash;for poisoners. &nbsp;In Germany coiners be boiled
to death in OIL&mdash;not cast in of a sudden, but by a rope let down into the
oil by degrees, and slowly; first the feet, then the legs, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O prithee no more, my lord, I cannot bear it!" cried Tom, covering his
eyes with his hands to shut out the picture. &nbsp;"I beseech your good
lordship that order be taken to change this law&mdash;oh, let no more poor
creatures be visited with its tortures."</p>

<p>The Earl's face showed profound gratification, for he was a man of
merciful and generous impulses&mdash;a thing not very common with his class in
that fierce age. &nbsp;He said&mdash;</p>

<p>"These your Grace's noble words have sealed its doom. &nbsp;History will
remember it to the honour of your royal house."</p>

<p>The under-sheriff was about to remove his prisoner; Tom gave him a sign
to wait; then he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good sir, I would look into this matter further. &nbsp;The man has said his
deed was but lamely proved. &nbsp;Tell me what thou knowest."</p>

<p>"If the King's grace please, it did appear upon the trial that this man
entered into a house in the hamlet of Islington where one lay sick&mdash;three
witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the morning, and two say it
was some minutes later&mdash;the sick man being alone at the time, and
sleeping&mdash;and presently the man came forth again and went his way. &nbsp;The
sick man died within the hour, being torn with spasms and retchings."</p>

<p>"Did any see the poison given? &nbsp;Was poison found?"</p>

<p>"Marry, no, my liege."</p>

<p>"Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?"</p>

<p>"Please your Majesty, the doctors testified that none die with such
symptoms but by poison."</p>

<p>Weighty evidence, this, in that simple age. &nbsp;Tom recognised its
formidable nature, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The doctor knoweth his trade&mdash;belike they were right. &nbsp;The matter hath
an ill-look for this poor man."</p>

<p>"Yet was not this all, your Majesty; there is more and worse. Many
testified that a witch, since gone from the village, none know whither,
did foretell, and speak it privately in their ears, that the sick man
WOULD DIE BY POISON&mdash;and more, that a stranger would give it&mdash;a stranger
with brown hair and clothed in a worn and common garb; and surely this
prisoner doth answer woundily to the bill. &nbsp;Please your Majesty to give
the circumstance that solemn weight which is its due, seeing it was
FORETOLD."</p>

<p>This was an argument of tremendous force in that superstitious day. &nbsp;Tom
felt that the thing was settled; if evidence was worth anything, this
poor fellow's guilt was proved. &nbsp;Still he offered the prisoner a chance,
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"If thou canst say aught in thy behalf, speak."</p>

<p>"Nought that will avail, my King. &nbsp;I am innocent, yet cannot I make it
appear. &nbsp;I have no friends, else might I show that I was not in Islington
that day; so also might I show that at that hour they name I was above a
league away, seeing I was at Wapping Old Stairs; yea more, my King, for I
could show, that whilst they say I was TAKING life, I was SAVING it. &nbsp;A
drowning boy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace! &nbsp;Sheriff, name the day the deed was done!"</p>

<p>"At ten in the morning, or some minutes later, the first day of the New
Year, most illustrious&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let the prisoner go free&mdash;it is the King's will!"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="15-187"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="15-187.jpg (170K)" src="images/15-187.jpg" height="1041" width="725">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Another blush followed this unregal outburst, and he covered his
indecorum as well as he could by adding&mdash;</p>

<p>"It enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle, hare-brained
evidence!"</p>

<p>A low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage. &nbsp;It was not
admiration of the decree that had been delivered by Tom, for the
propriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner was a thing
which few there would have felt justified in either admitting or
admiring&mdash;no, the admiration was for the intelligence and spirit which
Tom had displayed. &nbsp;Some of the low-voiced remarks were to this effect&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is no mad king&mdash;he hath his wits sound."</p>

<p>"How sanely he put his questions&mdash;how like his former natural self was
this abrupt imperious disposal of the matter!"</p>

<p>"God be thanked, his infirmity is spent! &nbsp;This is no weakling, but a
king. &nbsp;He hath borne himself like to his own father."</p>

<p>The air being filled with applause, Tom's ear necessarily caught a little
of it. &nbsp;The effect which this had upon him was to put him greatly at his
ease, and also to charge his system with very gratifying sensations.</p>

<p>However, his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these pleasant
thoughts and feelings; he was eager to know what sort of deadly mischief
the woman and the little girl could have been about; so, by his command,
the two terrified and sobbing creatures were brought before him.</p>

<p>"What is it that these have done?" he inquired of the sheriff.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="15-188"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="15-188.jpg (27K)" src="images/15-188.jpg" height="320" width="361">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Please your Majesty, a black crime is charged upon them, and clearly
proven; wherefore the judges have decreed, according to the law, that
they be hanged. &nbsp;They sold themselves to the devil&mdash;such is their crime."</p>

<p>Tom shuddered. &nbsp;He had been taught to abhor people who did this wicked
thing. &nbsp;Still, he was not going to deny himself the pleasure of feeding
his curiosity for all that; so he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where was this done?&mdash;and when?"</p>

<p>"On a midnight in December, in a ruined church, your Majesty."</p>

<p>Tom shuddered again.</p>

<p>"Who was there present?"</p>

<p>"Only these two, your grace&mdash;and THAT OTHER."</p>

<p>"Have these confessed?"</p>

<p>"Nay, not so, sire&mdash;they do deny it."</p>

<p>"Then prithee, how was it known?"</p>

<p>"Certain witness did see them wending thither, good your Majesty; this
bred the suspicion, and dire effects have since confirmed and justified
it. &nbsp;In particular, it is in evidence that through the wicked power so
obtained, they did invoke and bring about a storm that wasted all the
region round about. &nbsp;Above forty witnesses have proved the storm; and
sooth one might have had a thousand, for all had reason to remember it,
sith all had suffered by it."</p>

<p>"Certes this is a serious matter." &nbsp;Tom turned this dark piece of
scoundrelism over in his mind a while, then asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Suffered the woman also by the storm?"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="15-190"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="15-190.jpg (69K)" src="images/15-190.jpg" height="363" width="728">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Several old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition of the
wisdom of this question. &nbsp;The sheriff, however, saw nothing consequential
in the inquiry; he answered, with simple directness&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed did she, your Majesty, and most righteously, as all aver. Her
habitation was swept away, and herself and child left shelterless."</p>

<p>"Methinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly bought. She
had been cheated, had she paid but a farthing for it; that she paid her
soul, and her child's, argueth that she is mad; if she is mad she knoweth
not what she doth, therefore sinneth not."</p>

<p>The elderly heads nodded recognition of Tom's wisdom once more, and one
individual murmured, "An' the King be mad himself, according to report,
then is it a madness of a sort that would improve the sanity of some I
wot of, if by the gentle providence of God they could but catch it."</p>

<p>"What age hath the child?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"Nine years, please your Majesty."</p>

<p>"By the law of England may a child enter into covenant and sell itself,
my lord?" asked Tom, turning to a learned judge.</p>

<p>"The law doth not permit a child to make or meddle in any weighty matter,
good my liege, holding that its callow wit unfitteth it to cope with the
riper wit and evil schemings of them that are its elders. &nbsp;The DEVIL may
buy a child, if he so choose, and the child agree thereto, but not an
Englishman&mdash;in this latter case the contract would be null and void."</p>

<p>"It seemeth a rude unchristian thing, and ill contrived, that English law
denieth privileges to Englishmen to waste them on the devil!" cried Tom,
with honest heat.</p>

<p>This novel view of the matter excited many smiles, and was stored away in
many heads to be repeated about the Court as evidence of Tom's
originality as well as progress toward mental health.</p>

<p>The elder culprit had ceased from sobbing, and was hanging upon Tom's
words with an excited interest and a growing hope. &nbsp;Tom noticed this, and
it strongly inclined his sympathies toward her in her perilous and
unfriended situation. &nbsp;Presently he asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"How wrought they to bring the storm?"</p>

<p>"BY PULLING OFF THEIR STOCKINGS, sire."</p>

<p>This astonished Tom, and also fired his curiosity to fever heat. He said,
eagerly&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is wonderful! &nbsp;Hath it always this dread effect?"</p>

<p>"Always, my liege&mdash;at least if the woman desire it, and utter the needful
words, either in her mind or with her tongue."</p>

<p>Tom turned to the woman, and said with impetuous zeal&mdash;</p>

<p>"Exert thy power&mdash;I would see a storm!"</p>

<p>There was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage, and
a general, though unexpressed, desire to get out of the place&mdash;all of
which was lost upon Tom, who was dead to everything but the proposed
cataclysm. &nbsp;Seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the woman's face, he
added, excitedly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never fear&mdash;thou shalt be blameless. &nbsp;More&mdash;thou shalt go free&mdash;none
shall touch thee. &nbsp;Exert thy power."</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord the King, I have it not&mdash;I have been falsely accused."</p>

<p>"Thy fears stay thee. &nbsp;Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer no harm. &nbsp;Make
a storm&mdash;it mattereth not how small a one&mdash;I require nought great or
harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite&mdash;do this and thy life is
spared&mdash;thou shalt go out free, with thy child, bearing the King's pardon, and
safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm."</p>

<p>The woman prostrated herself, and protested, with tears, that she had no
power to do the miracle, else she would gladly win her child's life
alone, and be content to lose her own, if by obedience to the King's
command so precious a grace might be acquired.</p>

<p>Tom urged&mdash;the woman still adhered to her declarations. &nbsp;Finally he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think the woman hath said true. &nbsp;An' MY mother were in her place and
gifted with the devil's functions, she had not stayed a moment to call
her storms and lay the whole land in ruins, if the saving of my forfeit
life were the price she got! &nbsp;It is argument that other mothers are made
in like mould. &nbsp;Thou art free, goodwife&mdash;thou and thy child&mdash;for I do
think thee innocent. &nbsp;NOW thou'st nought to fear, being pardoned&mdash;pull
off thy stockings!&mdash;an' thou canst make me a storm, thou shalt be rich!"</p>

<p>The redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude, and proceeded to obey,
whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little marred by
apprehension; the courtiers at the same time manifesting decided
discomfort and uneasiness. &nbsp;The woman stripped her own feet and her
little girl's also, and plainly did her best to reward the King's
generosity with an earthquake, but it was all a failure and a
disappointment. &nbsp;Tom sighed, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"There, good soul, trouble thyself no further, thy power is departed out
of thee. &nbsp;Go thy way in peace; and if it return to thee at any time,
forget me not, but fetch me a storm." {13}</p>

<p>Chapter XVI. The State Dinner.</p>

<p>The dinner hour drew near&mdash;yet strangely enough, the thought brought but
slight discomfort to Tom, and hardly any terror. &nbsp;The morning's
experiences had wonderfully built up his confidence; the poor little
ash-cat was already more wonted to his strange garret, after four days'
habit, than a mature person could have become in a full month. &nbsp;A child's
facility in accommodating itself to circumstances was never more
strikingly illustrated.</p>

<p>Let us privileged ones hurry to the great banqueting-room and have a
glance at matters there whilst Tom is being made ready for the imposing
occasion. &nbsp;It is a spacious apartment, with gilded pillars and pilasters,
and pictured walls and ceilings. &nbsp;At the door stand tall guards, as rigid
as statues, dressed in rich and picturesque costumes, and bearing
halberds. &nbsp;In a high gallery which runs all around the place is a band of
musicians and a packed company of citizens of both sexes, in brilliant
attire. &nbsp;In the centre of the room, upon a raised platform, is Tom's
table. Now let the ancient chronicler speak:</p>

<br><br>
<a name="16-196"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="16-196.jpg (65K)" src="images/16-196.jpg" height="608" width="505">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"A gentleman enters the room bearing a rod, and along with him another
bearing a tablecloth, which, after they have both kneeled three times
with the utmost veneration, he spreads upon the table, and after kneeling
again they both retire; then come two others, one with the rod again, the
other with a salt-cellar, a plate, and bread; when they have kneeled as
the others had done, and placed what was brought upon the table, they too
retire with the same ceremonies performed by the first; at last come two
nobles, richly clothed, one bearing a tasting-knife, who, after
prostrating themselves three times in the most graceful manner, approach
and rub the table with bread and salt, with as much awe as if the King
had been present." {6}</p>

<p>So end the solemn preliminaries. &nbsp;Now, far down the echoing corridors we
hear a bugle-blast, and the indistinct cry, "Place for the King! &nbsp;Way for
the King's most excellent majesty!" &nbsp;These sounds are momently
repeated&mdash;they grow nearer and nearer&mdash;and presently, almost in our faces, the
martial note peals and the cry rings out, "Way for the King!" &nbsp;At this
instant the shining pageant appears, and files in at the door, with a
measured march. Let the chronicler speak again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"First come Gentlemen, Barons, Earls, Knights of the Garter, all richly
dressed and bareheaded; next comes the Chancellor, between two, one of
which carries the royal sceptre, the other the Sword of State in a red
scabbard, studded with golden fleurs-de-lis, the point upwards; next
comes the King himself&mdash;whom, upon his appearing, twelve trumpets and
many drums salute with a great burst of welcome, whilst all in the
galleries rise in their places, crying 'God save the King!' &nbsp;After him
come nobles attached to his person, and on his right and left march his
guard of honour, his fifty Gentlemen Pensioners, with gilt battle-axes."</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>This was all fine and pleasant. &nbsp;Tom's pulse beat high, and a glad light
was in his eye. &nbsp;He bore himself right gracefully, and all the more so
because he was not thinking of how he was doing it, his mind being
charmed and occupied with the blithe sights and sounds about him&mdash;and
besides, nobody can be very ungraceful in nicely-fitting beautiful
clothes after he has grown a little used to them&mdash;especially if he is for
the moment unconscious of them. Tom remembered his instructions, and
acknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of his plumed head,
and a courteous "I thank ye, my good people."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="16-198"></a>
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>


<p>He seated himself at table, without removing his cap; and did it without
the least embarrassment; for to eat with one's cap on was the one
solitary royal custom upon which the kings and the Cantys met upon common
ground, neither party having any advantage over the other in the matter
of old familiarity with it. &nbsp;The pageant broke up and grouped itself
picturesquely, and remained bareheaded.</p>

<p>Now to the sound of gay music the Yeomen of the Guard entered,&mdash;"the
tallest and mightiest men in England, they being carefully selected in
this regard"&mdash;but we will let the chronicler tell about it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Yeomen of the Guard entered, bareheaded, clothed in scarlet, with
golden roses upon their backs; and these went and came, bringing in each
turn a course of dishes, served in plate. &nbsp;These dishes were received by
a gentleman in the same order they were brought, and placed upon the
table, while the taster gave to each guard a mouthful to eat of the
particular dish he had brought, for fear of any poison."</p>

<p>Tom made a good dinner, notwithstanding he was conscious that hundreds of
eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him eat it with an
interest which could not have been more intense if it had been a deadly
explosive and was expected to blow him up and scatter him all about the
place. &nbsp;He was careful not to hurry, and equally careful not to do
anything whatever for himself, but wait till the proper official knelt
down and did it for him. &nbsp;He got through without a mistake&mdash;flawless and
precious triumph.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>When the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst of his
bright pageant, with the happy noises in his ears of blaring bugles,
rolling drums, and thundering acclamations, he felt that if he had seen
the worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he would be glad to
endure several times a day if by that means he could but buy himself free
from some of the more formidable requirements of his royal office.</p>

<p>Chapter XVII. Foo-foo the First.</p>

<p>Miles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the bridge,
keeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought, and hoping and
expecting to overtake them presently. &nbsp;He was disappointed in this,
however. &nbsp;By asking questions, he was enabled to track them part of the
way through Southwark; then all traces ceased, and he was perplexed as to
how to proceed. &nbsp;Still, he continued his efforts as best he could during
the rest of the day. &nbsp;Nightfall found him leg-weary, half-famished, and
his desire as far from accomplishment as ever; so he supped at the Tabard
Inn and went to bed, resolved to make an early start in the morning, and
give the town an exhaustive search. &nbsp;As he lay thinking and planning, he
presently began to reason thus: &nbsp;The boy would escape from the ruffian,
his reputed father, if possible; would he go back to London and seek his
former haunts? &nbsp;No, he would not do that, he would avoid recapture.
What, then, would he do? &nbsp;Never having had a friend in the world, or a
protector, until he met Miles Hendon, he would naturally try to find that
friend again, provided the effort did not require him to go toward London
and danger. &nbsp;He would strike for Hendon Hall, that is what he would do,
for he knew Hendon was homeward bound and there he might expect to find
him. &nbsp;Yes, the case was plain to Hendon&mdash;he must lose no more time in
Southwark, but move at once through Kent, toward Monk's Holm, searching
the wood and inquiring as he went. &nbsp;Let us return to the vanished little
King now.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="17-205"></a>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>The ruffian whom the waiter at the inn on the bridge saw 'about to join'
the youth and the King did not exactly join them, but fell in close
behind them and followed their steps. &nbsp;He said nothing. His left arm was
in a sling, and he wore a large green patch over his left eye; he limped
slightly, and used an oaken staff as a support. &nbsp;The youth led the King a
crooked course through Southwark, and by-and-by struck into the high road
beyond. &nbsp;The King was irritated, now, and said he would stop here&mdash;it was
Hendon's place to come to him, not his to go to Hendon. &nbsp;He would not
endure such insolence; he would stop where he was. &nbsp;The youth said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou'lt tarry here, and thy friend lying wounded in the wood yonder? &nbsp;So
be it, then."</p>

<p>The King's manner changed at once. &nbsp;He cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wounded? &nbsp;And who hath dared to do it? &nbsp;But that is apart; lead on, lead
on! &nbsp;Faster, sirrah! &nbsp;Art shod with lead? &nbsp;Wounded, is he? &nbsp;Now though
the doer of it be a duke's son he shall rue it!"</p>

<p>It was some distance to the wood, but the space was speedily traversed.
The youth looked about him, discovered a bough sticking in the ground,
with a small bit of rag tied to it, then led the way into the forest,
watching for similar boughs and finding them at intervals; they were
evidently guides to the point he was aiming at. &nbsp;By-and-by an open place
was reached, where were the charred remains of a farm-house, and near
them a barn which was falling to ruin and decay. &nbsp;There was no sign of
life anywhere, and utter silence prevailed. &nbsp;The youth entered the barn,
the King following eagerly upon his heels. &nbsp;No one there! The King shot a
surprised and suspicious glance at the youth, and asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>A mocking laugh was his answer. &nbsp;The King was in a rage in a moment; he
seized a billet of wood and was in the act of charging upon the youth
when another mocking laugh fell upon his ear. &nbsp;It was from the lame
ruffian who had been following at a distance. The King turned and said
angrily&mdash;</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Who art thou? &nbsp;What is thy business here?"</p>

<p>"Leave thy foolery," said the man, "and quiet thyself. &nbsp;My disguise is
none so good that thou canst pretend thou knowest not thy father through
it."</p>

<p>"Thou art not my father. &nbsp;I know thee not. &nbsp;I am the King. &nbsp;If thou hast
hid my servant, find him for me, or thou shalt sup sorrow for what thou
hast done."</p>

<p>John Canty replied, in a stern and measured voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is plain thou art mad, and I am loath to punish thee; &nbsp;but if thou
provoke me, I must. &nbsp;Thy prating doth no harm here, where there are no
ears that need to mind thy follies; yet it is well to practise thy tongue
to wary speech, that it may do no hurt when our quarters change. &nbsp;I have
done a murder, and may not tarry at home&mdash;neither shalt thou, seeing I
need thy service. &nbsp;My name is changed, for wise reasons; it is
Hobbs&mdash;John Hobbs; thine is Jack&mdash;charge thy memory accordingly. &nbsp;Now, then,
speak. &nbsp;Where is thy mother? &nbsp;Where are thy sisters? &nbsp;They came not to
the place appointed&mdash;knowest thou whither they went?"</p>

<p>The King answered sullenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Trouble me not with these riddles. &nbsp;My mother is dead; my sisters are in
the palace."</p>

<p>The youth near by burst into a derisive laugh, and the King would have
assaulted him, but Canty&mdash;or Hobbs, as he now called himself&mdash;prevented
him, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Peace, Hugo, vex him not; his mind is astray, and thy ways fret him.
Sit thee down, Jack, and quiet thyself; thou shalt have a morsel to eat,
anon."</p>

<p>Hobbs and Hugo fell to talking together, in low voices, and the King
removed himself as far as he could from their disagreeable company. &nbsp;He
withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of the barn, where he found
the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with straw. &nbsp;He lay down here, drew
straw over himself in lieu of blankets, and was soon absorbed in
thinking. &nbsp;He had many griefs, but the minor ones were swept almost into
forgetfulness by the supreme one, the loss of his father. &nbsp;To the rest of
the world the name of Henry VIII. brought a shiver, and suggested an ogre
whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand dealt scourgings and
death; but to this boy the name brought only sensations of pleasure; the
figure it invoked wore a countenance that was all gentleness and
affection. &nbsp;He called to mind a long succession of loving passages
between his father and himself, and dwelt fondly upon them, his unstinted
tears attesting how deep and real was the grief that possessed his heart.
As the afternoon wasted away, the lad, wearied with his troubles, sank
gradually into a tranquil and healing slumber.</p>

<p>After a considerable time&mdash;he could not tell how long&mdash;his senses
struggled to a half-consciousness, and as he lay with closed eyes vaguely
wondering where he was and what had been happening, he noted a murmurous
sound, the sullen beating of rain upon the roof. A snug sense of comfort
stole over him, which was rudely broken, the next moment, by a chorus of
piping cackles and coarse laughter. &nbsp;It startled him disagreeably, and he
unmuffled his head to see whence this interruption proceeded. &nbsp;A grim and
unsightly picture met his eye. &nbsp;A bright fire was burning in the middle
of the floor, at the other end of the barn; and around it, and lit
weirdly up by the red glare, lolled and sprawled the motliest company of
tattered gutter-scum and ruffians, of both sexes, he had ever read or
dreamed of. &nbsp;There were huge stalwart men, brown with exposure,
long-haired, and clothed in fantastic rags; there were middle-sized youths, of
truculent countenance, and similarly clad; there were blind mendicants,
with patched or bandaged eyes; crippled ones, with wooden legs and
crutches; diseased ones, with running sores peeping from ineffectual
wrappings; there was a villain-looking pedlar with his pack; a
knife-grinder, a tinker, and a barber-surgeon, with the implements of their
trades; some of the females were hardly-grown girls, some were at prime,
some were old and wrinkled hags, and all were loud, brazen, foul-mouthed;
and all soiled and slatternly; there were three sore-faced babies; there
were a couple of starveling curs, with strings about their necks, whose
office was to lead the blind.</p>

<p>The night was come, the gang had just finished feasting, an orgy was
beginning; the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth. A general
cry broke forth&mdash;</p>

<p>"A song! a song from the Bat and Dick and Dot-and-go-One!"</p>

<p>One of the blind men got up, and made ready by casting aside the patches
that sheltered his excellent eyes, and the pathetic placard which recited
the cause of his calamity. &nbsp;Dot-and-go-One disencumbered himself of his
timber leg and took his place, upon sound and healthy limbs, beside his
fellow-rascal; then they roared out a rollicking ditty, and were
reinforced by the whole crew, at the end of each stanza, in a rousing
chorus. &nbsp;By the time the last stanza was reached, the half-drunken
enthusiasm had risen to such a pitch, that everybody joined in and sang
it clear through from the beginning, producing a volume of villainous
sound that made the rafters quake. &nbsp;These were the inspiring words:&mdash;</p>
<center>
<p>'Bien Darkman's then, Bouse Mort and Ken,<br>
The bien Coves bings awast,<br>
On Chates to trine by Rome Coves dine<br>
For his long lib at last.<br>
Bing'd out bien Morts and toure, and toure,<br>
Bing out of the Rome vile bine,<br>
And toure the Cove that cloy'd your duds,<br>
Upon the Chates to trine.'<br><br>

<p>Conversation followed; not in the thieves' dialect of the song, for that
was only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be listening. &nbsp;In the
course of it, it appeared that 'John Hobbs' was not altogether a new
recruit, but had trained in the gang at some former time. &nbsp;His later
history was called for, and when he said he had 'accidentally' killed a
man, considerable satisfaction was expressed; when he added that the man
was a priest, he was roundly applauded, and had to take a drink with
everybody. &nbsp;Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously, and new ones were
proud to shake him by the hand. &nbsp;He was asked why he had 'tarried away so
many months.' &nbsp;He answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"London is better than the country, and safer, these late years, the laws
be so bitter and so diligently enforced. &nbsp;An' I had not had that
accident, I had stayed there. &nbsp;I had resolved to stay, and never more
venture country-wards&mdash;but the accident has ended that."</p>

<p>He inquired how many persons the gang numbered now. &nbsp;The 'ruffler,' or
chief, answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Five and twenty sturdy budges, bulks, files, clapperdogeons and
maunders, counting the dells and doxies and other morts. {7} &nbsp;Most are
here, the rest are wandering eastward, along the winter lay. We follow at
dawn."</p>

<p>"I do not see the Wen among the honest folk about me. &nbsp;Where may he be?"</p>

<p>"Poor lad, his diet is brimstone, now, and over hot for a delicate taste.
He was killed in a brawl, somewhere about midsummer."</p>

<p>"I sorrow to hear that; the Wen was a capable man, and brave."</p>

<p>"That was he, truly. &nbsp;Black Bess, his dell, is of us yet, but absent on
the eastward tramp; a fine lass, of nice ways and orderly conduct, none
ever seeing her drunk above four days in the seven."</p>

<p>"She was ever strict&mdash;I remember it well&mdash;a goodly wench and worthy all
commendation. &nbsp;Her mother was more free and less particular; a
troublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished with a wit above the
common."</p>

<p>"We lost her through it. &nbsp;Her gift of palmistry and other sorts of
fortune-telling begot for her at last a witch's name and fame. The law
roasted her to death at a slow fire. &nbsp;It did touch me to a sort of
tenderness to see the gallant way she met her lot&mdash;cursing and reviling
all the crowd that gaped and gazed around her, whilst the flames licked
upward toward her face and catched her thin locks and crackled about her
old gray head&mdash;cursing them! why an' thou should'st live a thousand years
thoud'st never hear so masterful a cursing. &nbsp;Alack, her art died with
her. &nbsp;There be base and weakling imitations left, but no true blasphemy."</p>

<p>The Ruffler sighed; the listeners sighed in sympathy; a general
depression fell upon the company for a moment, for even hardened outcasts
like these are not wholly dead to sentiment, but are able to feel a
fleeting sense of loss and affliction at wide intervals and under
peculiarly favouring circumstances&mdash;as in cases like to this, for
instance, when genius and culture depart and leave no heir. &nbsp;However, a
deep drink all round soon restored the spirits of the mourners.</p>

<p>"Have any others of our friends fared hardly?" asked Hobbs.</p>

<p>"Some&mdash;yes. &nbsp;Particularly new comers&mdash;such as small husbandmen turned
shiftless and hungry upon the world because their farms were taken from
them to be changed to sheep ranges. &nbsp;They begged, and were whipped at the
cart's tail, naked from the girdle up, till the blood ran; then set in
the stocks to be pelted; they begged again, were whipped again, and
deprived of an ear; they begged a third time&mdash;poor devils, what else
could they do?&mdash;and were branded on the cheek with a red-hot iron, then
sold for slaves; they ran away, were hunted down, and hanged. &nbsp;'Tis a
brief tale, and quickly told. &nbsp;Others of us have fared less hardly. Stand
forth, Yokel, Burns, and Hodge&mdash;show your adornments!"</p>

<p>These stood up and stripped away some of their rags, exposing their
backs, criss-crossed with ropy old welts left by the lash; one turned up
his hair and showed the place where a left ear had once been; another
showed a brand upon his shoulder&mdash;the letter V&mdash;and a mutilated ear; the
third said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am Yokel, once a farmer and prosperous, with loving wife and kids&mdash;now
am I somewhat different in estate and calling; and the wife and kids are
gone; mayhap they are in heaven, mayhap in&mdash;in the other place&mdash;but the
kindly God be thanked, they bide no more in ENGLAND! &nbsp;My good old
blameless mother strove to earn bread by nursing the sick; one of these
died, the doctors knew not how, so my mother was burnt for a witch,
whilst my babes looked on and wailed. &nbsp;English law!&mdash;up, all, with your
cups!&mdash;now all together and with a cheer!&mdash;drink to the merciful English
law that delivered HER from the English hell! &nbsp;Thank you, mates, one and
all. &nbsp;I begged, from house to house&mdash;I and the wife&mdash;bearing with us the
hungry kids&mdash;but it was crime to be hungry in England&mdash;so they stripped
us and lashed us through three towns. &nbsp;Drink ye all again to the merciful
English law!&mdash;for its lash drank deep of my Mary's blood and its blessed
deliverance came quick. &nbsp;She lies there, in the potter's field, safe from
all harms. &nbsp;And the kids&mdash;well, whilst the law lashed me from town to
town, they starved. Drink, lads&mdash;only a drop&mdash;a drop to the poor kids,
that never did any creature harm. &nbsp;I begged again&mdash;begged, for a crust,
and got the stocks and lost an ear&mdash;see, here bides the stump; I begged
again, and here is the stump of the other to keep me minded of it. And
still I begged again, and was sold for a slave&mdash;here on my cheek under
this stain, if I washed it off, ye might see the red S the branding-iron
left there! &nbsp;A SLAVE! &nbsp;Do you understand that word? &nbsp;An English
SLAVE!&mdash;that is he that stands before ye. &nbsp;I have run from my master, and when I
am found&mdash;the heavy curse of heaven fall on the law of the land that hath
commanded it!&mdash;I shall hang!" {1}</p>

<p>A ringing voice came through the murky air&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thou shalt NOT!&mdash;and this day the end of that law is come!"</p>

<p>All turned, and saw the fantastic figure of the little King approaching
hurriedly; as it emerged into the light and was clearly revealed, a
general explosion of inquiries broke out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is it? &nbsp;WHAT is it? &nbsp;Who art thou, manikin?"</p>

<p>The boy stood unconfused in the midst of all those surprised and
questioning eyes, and answered with princely dignity&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am Edward, King of England."</p>

<p>A wild burst of laughter followed, partly of derision and partly of
delight in the excellence of the joke. &nbsp;The King was stung. &nbsp;He said
sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ye mannerless vagrants, is this your recognition of the royal boon I
have promised?"</p>

<p>He said more, with angry voice and excited gesture, but it was lost in a
whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations. &nbsp;'John Hobbs' made
several attempts to make himself heard above the din, and at last
succeeded&mdash;saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mates, he is my son, a dreamer, a fool, and stark mad&mdash;mind him not&mdash;he
thinketh he IS the King."</p>

<p>"I AM the King," said Edward, turning toward him, "as thou shalt know to
thy cost, in good time. &nbsp;Thou hast confessed a murder&mdash;thou shalt swing
for it."</p>

<p>"THOU'LT betray me?&mdash;THOU? &nbsp;An' I get my hands upon thee&mdash;"</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Tut-tut!" said the burley Ruffler, interposing in time to save the King,
and emphasising this service by knocking Hobbs down with his fist, "hast
respect for neither Kings NOR Rufflers? &nbsp;An' thou insult my presence so
again, I'll hang thee up myself." &nbsp;Then he said to his Majesty, "Thou
must make no threats against thy mates, lad; and thou must guard thy
tongue from saying evil of them elsewhere. &nbsp;BE King, if it please thy mad
humour, but be not harmful in it. &nbsp;Sink the title thou hast uttered&mdash;'tis
treason; we be bad men in some few trifling ways, but none among us is so
base as to be traitor to his King; we be loving and loyal hearts, in that
regard. &nbsp;Note if I speak truth. &nbsp;Now&mdash;all together: &nbsp;'Long live Edward,
King of England!'"</p>

<p>"LONG LIVE EDWARD, KING OF ENGLAND!"</p>

<p>The response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew that the
crazy building vibrated to the sound. &nbsp;The little King's face lighted
with pleasure for an instant, and he slightly inclined his head, and said
with grave simplicity&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thank you, my good people."</p>

<p>This unexpected result threw the company into convulsions of merriment.
When something like quiet was presently come again, the Ruffler said,
firmly, but with an accent of good nature&mdash;</p>

<p>"Drop it, boy, 'tis not wise, nor well. &nbsp;Humour thy fancy, if thou must,
but choose some other title."</p>

<p>A tinker shrieked out a suggestion&mdash;</p>

<p>"Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!"</p>

<p>The title 'took,' at once, every throat responded, and a roaring shout
went up, of&mdash;</p>

<p>"Long live Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!" followed by
hootings, cat-calls, and peals of laughter.</p>

<p>"Hale him forth, and crown him!"</p>

<p>"Robe him!"</p>

<p>"Sceptre him!"</p>

<p>"Throne him!"</p>

<p>These and twenty other cries broke out at once! and almost before the
poor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned with a tin basin,
robed in a tattered blanket, throned upon a barrel, and sceptred with the
tinker's soldering-iron. &nbsp;Then all flung themselves upon their knees
about him and sent up a chorus of ironical wailings, and mocking
supplications, whilst they swabbed their eyes with their soiled and
ragged sleeves and aprons&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be gracious to us, O sweet King!"</p>

<p>"Trample not upon thy beseeching worms, O noble Majesty!"</p>

<p>"Pity thy slaves, and comfort them with a royal kick!"</p>

<p>"Cheer us and warm us with thy gracious rays, O flaming sun of
sovereignty!"</p>

<p>"Sanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot, that we may eat the dirt
and be ennobled!"</p>

<p>"Deign to spit upon us, O Sire, that our children's children may tell of
thy princely condescension, and be proud and happy for ever!"</p>

<p>But the humorous tinker made the 'hit' of the evening and carried off the
honours. &nbsp;Kneeling, he pretended to kiss the King's foot, and was
indignantly spurned; whereupon he went about begging for a rag to paste
over the place upon his face which had been touched by the foot, saying
it must be preserved from contact with the vulgar air, and that he should
make his fortune by going on the highway and exposing it to view at the
rate of a hundred shillings a sight. &nbsp;He made himself so killingly funny
that he was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy rabble.</p>

<p>Tears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarch's eyes; and
the thought in his heart was, "Had I offered them a deep wrong they could
not be more cruel&mdash;yet have I proffered nought but to do them a
kindness&mdash;and it is thus they use me for it!"</p>
