    <p>
      June 18&mdash;. Squire Hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks,
      called the &ldquo;stile,&rdquo; in front of his house, contemplating the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The locality was Obedstown, East Tennessee. You would not know that
      Obedstown stood on the top of a mountain, for there was nothing about the
      landscape to indicate it&mdash;but it did: a mountain that stretched
      abroad over whole counties, and rose very gradually. The district was
      called the &ldquo;Knobs of East Tennessee,&rdquo; and had a reputation like Nazareth,
      as far as turning out any good thing was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire&rsquo;s house was a double log cabin, in a state of decay; two or
      three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold, and lifted their heads
      sadly whenever Mrs. Hawkins or the children stepped in and out over their
      bodies. Rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard; a bench stood near
      the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of water and a gourd; a
      cat had begun to drink from the pail, but the exertion was overtaxing her
      energies, and she had stopped to rest. There was an ash-hopper by the
      fence, and an iron pot, for soft-soap-boiling, near it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p018" id="p018"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p018.jpg (48K)" src="images/p018.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This dwelling constituted one-fifteenth of Obedstown; the other fourteen
      houses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the
      corn-fields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the city
      and not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on his
      eyes for information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire&rdquo; Hawkins got his title from being postmaster of Obedstown&mdash;not
      that the title properly belonged to the office, but because in those
      regions the chief citizens always must have titles of some sort, and so
      the usual courtesy had been extended to Hawkins. The mail was monthly, and
      sometimes amounted to as much as three or four letters at a single
      delivery. Even a rush like this did not fill up the postmaster&rsquo;s whole
      month, though, and therefore he &ldquo;kept store&rdquo; in the intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire was contemplating the morning. It was balmy and tranquil, the
      vagrant breezes were laden with the odor of flowers, the murmur of bees
      was in the air, there was everywhere that suggestion of repose that summer
      woodlands bring to the senses, and the vague, pleasurable melancholy that
      such a time and such surroundings inspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p019" id="p019"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p019.jpg (17K)" src="images/p019.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the United States mail arrived, on horseback. There was but one
      letter, and it was for the postmaster. The long-legged youth who carried
      the mail tarried an hour to talk, for there was no hurry; and in a little
      while the male population of the village had assembled to help. As a
      general thing, they were dressed in homespun &ldquo;jeans,&rdquo; blue or yellow&mdash;here
      were no other varieties of it; all wore one suspender and sometimes two&mdash;yarn
      ones knitted at home,&mdash;some wore vests, but few wore coats. Such
      coats and vests as did appear, however, were rather picturesque than
      otherwise, for they were made of tolerably fanciful patterns of calico&mdash;a
      fashion which prevails thereto this day among those of the community who
      have tastes above the common level and are able to afford style. Every
      individual arrived with his hands in his pockets; a hand came out
      occasionally for a purpose, but it always went back again after service;
      and if it was the head that was served, just the cant that the dilapidated
      straw hat got by being uplifted and rooted under, was retained until the
      next call altered the inclination; many hats were present, but none were
      erect and no two were canted just alike. We are speaking impartially of
      men, youths and boys. And we are also speaking of these three estates when
      we say that every individual was either chewing natural leaf tobacco
      prepared on his own premises, or smoking the same in a corn-cob pipe. Few
      of the men wore whiskers; none wore moustaches; some had a thick jungle of
      hair under the chin and hiding the throat&mdash;the only pattern
      recognized there as being the correct thing in whiskers; but no part of
      any individual&rsquo;s face had seen a razor for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p020" id="p020"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p020.jpg (57K)" src="images/p020.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      These neighbors stood a few moments looking at the mail carrier
      reflectively while he talked; but fatigue soon began to show itself, and
      one after another they climbed up and occupied the top rail of the fence,
      hump-shouldered and grave, like a company of buzzards assembled for supper
      and listening for the death-rattle. Old Damrell said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha hain&rsquo;t no news &lsquo;bout the jedge, hit ain&rsquo;t likely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cain&rsquo;t tell for sartin; some thinks he&rsquo;s gwyne to be &lsquo;long toreckly, and
      some thinks &lsquo;e hain&rsquo;t. Russ Mosely he tote ole Hanks he mought git to
      Obeds tomorrer or nex&rsquo; day he reckoned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wisht I knowed. I got a &lsquo;prime sow and pigs in the cote-house,
      and I hain&rsquo;t got no place for to put &lsquo;em. If the jedge is a gwyne to hold
      cote, I got to roust &lsquo;em out, I reckon. But tomorrer&rsquo;ll do, I &lsquo;spect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker bunched his thick lips together like the stem-end of a tomato
      and shot a bumble-bee dead that had lit on a weed seven feet away. One
      after another the several chewers expressed a charge of tobacco juice and
      delivered it at the deceased with steady, aim and faultless accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a stirrin&rsquo;, down &lsquo;bout the Forks?&rdquo; continued Old Damrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I dunno, skasely. Ole Drake Higgins he&rsquo;s ben down to Shelby las&rsquo;
      week. Tuck his crap down; couldn&rsquo;t git shet o&rsquo; the most uv it; hit wasn&rsquo;t
      no time for to sell, he say, so he &lsquo;fotch it back agin, &lsquo;lowin&rsquo; to wait
      tell fall. Talks &lsquo;bout goin&rsquo; to Mozouri&mdash;lots uv &lsquo;ems talkin&rsquo; that&mdash;away
      down thar, Ole Higgins say. Cain&rsquo;t make a livin&rsquo; here no mo&rsquo;, sich times
      as these. Si Higgins he&rsquo;s ben over to Kaintuck n&rsquo; married a high-toned gal
      thar, outen the fust families, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s come back to the Forks with jist a
      hell&rsquo;s-mint o&rsquo; whoop-jamboree notions, folks says. He&rsquo;s tuck an&rsquo; fixed up
      the ole house like they does in Kaintuck, he say, an&rsquo; tha&rsquo;s ben folks come
      cler from Turpentine for to see it. He&rsquo;s tuck an gawmed it all over on the
      inside with plarsterin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s plasterin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dono. Hit&rsquo;s what he calls it. Ole Mam Higgins, she tole me. She say she
      wasn&rsquo;t gwyne to hang out in no sich a dern hole like a hog. Says it&rsquo;s mud,
      or some sich kind o&rsquo; nastiness that sticks on n&rsquo; covers up everything.
      Plarsterin&rsquo;, Si calls it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This marvel was discussed at considerable length; and almost with
      animation. But presently there was a dog-fight over in the neighborhood of
      the blacksmith shop, and the visitors slid off their perch like so many
      turtles and strode to the battle-field with an interest bordering on
      eagerness.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

      The Squire remained, and read his letter. Then he sighed, and sat long in
      meditation. At intervals he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missouri. Missouri. Well, well, well, everything is so uncertain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll do it.&mdash;A man will just rot, here. My house my yard,
      everything around me, in fact, shows&rsquo; that I am becoming one of these
      cattle&mdash;and I used to be thrifty in other times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was not more than thirty-five, but he had a worn look that made him
      seem older. He left the stile, entered that part of his house which was
      the store, traded a quart of thick molasses for a coonskin and a cake of
      beeswax, to an old dame in linsey-woolsey, put his letter away, and went
      into the kitchen. His wife was there, constructing some dried apple pies;
      a slovenly urchin of ten was dreaming over a rude weather-vane of his own
      contriving; his small sister, close upon four years of age, was sopping
      corn-bread in some gravy left in the bottom of a frying-pan and trying
      hard not to sop over a finger-mark that divided the pan through the middle&mdash;for
      the other side belonged to the brother, whose musings made him forget his
      stomach for the moment; a negro woman was busy cooking, at a vast
      fire-place. Shiftlessness and poverty reigned in the place.

      &ldquo;Nancy, I&rsquo;ve made up my mind. The world is done with me, and perhaps I
      ought to be done with it. But no matter&mdash;I can wait. I am going to
      Missouri. I won&rsquo;t stay in this dead country and decay with it. I&rsquo;ve had it
      on my mind sometime. I&rsquo;m going to sell out here for whatever I can get,
      and buy a wagon and team and put you and the children in it and start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anywhere that suits you, suits me, Si. And the children can&rsquo;t be any
      worse off in Missouri than, they are here, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Motioning his wife to a private conference in their own room, Hawkins
      said: &ldquo;No, they&rsquo;ll be better off. I&rsquo;ve looked out for them, Nancy,&rdquo; and
      his face lighted. &ldquo;Do you see these papers? Well, they are evidence that I
      have taken up Seventy-five Thousand Acres of Land in this county&mdash;think
      what an enormous fortune it will be some day! Why, Nancy, enormous don&rsquo;t
      express it&mdash;the word&rsquo;s too tame! I tell your Nancy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For goodness sake, Si&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Nancy, wait&mdash;let me finish&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been secretly bailing
      and fuming with this grand inspiration for weeks, and I must talk or I&rsquo;ll
      burst! I haven&rsquo;t whispered to a soul&mdash;not a word&mdash;have had my
      countenance under lock and key, for fear it might drop something that
      would tell even these animals here how to discern the gold mine that&rsquo;s
      glaring under their noses. Now all that is necessary to hold this land and
      keep it in the family is to pay the trifling taxes on it yearly&mdash;five
      or ten dollars&mdash;the whole tract would not sell for over a third of a
      cent an acre now, but some day people will be glad to get it for twenty
      dollars, fifty dollars, a hundred dollars an acre! What should you say to&rdquo;
       [here he dropped his voice to a whisper and looked anxiously around to see
      that there were no eavesdroppers,] &ldquo;a thousand dollars an acre!

    <p>
      &ldquo;Well you may open your eyes and stare! But it&rsquo;s so. You and I may not see
      the day, but they&rsquo;ll see it. Mind I tell you; they&rsquo;ll see it. Nancy,
      you&rsquo;ve heard of steamboats, and maybe you believed in them&mdash;of course
      you did. You&rsquo;ve heard these cattle here scoff at them and call them lies
      and humbugs,&mdash;but they&rsquo;re not lies and humbugs, they&rsquo;re a reality and
      they&rsquo;re going to be a more wonderful thing some day than they are now.
      They&rsquo;re going to make a revolution in this world&rsquo;s affairs that will make
      men dizzy to contemplate. I&rsquo;ve been watching&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been watching
      while some people slept, and I know what&rsquo;s coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even you and I will see the day that steamboats will come up that little
      Turkey river to within twenty miles of this land of ours&mdash;and in high
      water they&rsquo;ll come right to it! And this is not all, Nancy&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t
      even half! There&rsquo;s a bigger wonder&mdash;the railroad! These worms here
      have never even heard of it&mdash;and when they do they&rsquo;ll not believe in
      it. But it&rsquo;s another fact. Coaches that fly over the ground twenty miles
      an hour&mdash;heavens and earth, think of that, Nancy! Twenty miles an
      hour. It makes a man&rsquo;s brain whirl. Some day, when you and I are in our
      graves, there&rsquo;ll be a railroad stretching hundreds of miles&mdash;all the
      way down from the cities of the Northern States to New Orleans&mdash;and
      its got to run within thirty miles of this land&mdash;may be even touch a
      corner of it. Well, do you know, they&rsquo;ve quit burning wood in some places
      in the Eastern States? And what do you suppose they burn? Coal!&rdquo; [He bent
      over and whispered again:] &ldquo;There&rsquo;s world&mdash;worlds of it on this land!
      You know that black stuff that crops out of the bank of the branch?&mdash;well,
      that&rsquo;s it. You&rsquo;ve taken it for rocks; so has every body here; and they&rsquo;ve
      built little dams and such things with it. One man was going to build a
      chimney out of it. Nancy I expect I turned as white as a sheet! Why, it
      might have caught fire and told everything. I showed him it was too
      crumbly. Then he was going to build it of copper ore&mdash;splendid yellow
      forty-per-cent. ore! There&rsquo;s fortunes upon fortunes of copper ore on our
      land! It scared me to death, the idea of this fool starting a smelting
      furnace in his house without knowing it, and getting his dull eyes opened.
      And then he was going to build it of iron ore! There&rsquo;s mountains of iron
      ore here, Nancy&mdash;whole mountains of it. I wouldn&rsquo;t take any chances.
      I just stuck by him&mdash;I haunted him&mdash;I never let him alone till
      he built it of mud and sticks like all the rest of the chimneys in this
      dismal country. Pine forests, wheat land, corn land, iron, copper, coal&mdash;wait
      till the railroads come, and the steamboats! We&rsquo;ll never see the day,
      Nancy&mdash;never in the world&mdash;never, never, never, child. We&rsquo;ve got
      to drag along, drag along, and eat crusts in toil and poverty, all
      hopeless and forlorn&mdash;but they&rsquo;ll ride in coaches, Nancy! They&rsquo;ll
      live like the princes of the earth; they&rsquo;ll be courted and worshiped;
      their names will be known from ocean to ocean! Ah, well-a-day! Will they
      ever come back here, on the railroad and the steamboat, and say, &lsquo;This one
      little spot shall not be touched&mdash;this hovel shall be sacred&mdash;for
      here our father and our mother suffered for us, thought for us, laid the
      foundations of our future as solid as the hills!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a great, good, noble soul, Si Hawkins, and I am an honored woman
      to be the wife of such a man&rdquo;&mdash;and the tears stood in her eyes when
      she said it. &ldquo;We will go to Missouri. You are out of your place, here,
      among these groping dumb creatures. We will find a higher place, where you
      can walk with your own kind, and be understood when you speak&mdash;not
      stared at as if you were talking some foreign tongue. I would go anywhere,
      anywhere in the wide world with you. I would rather my body would starve
      and die than your mind should hunger and wither away in this lonely land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoken like yourself, my child! But we&rsquo;ll not starve, Nancy. Far from it.
      I have a letter from Beriah Sellers&mdash;just came this day. A letter
      that&mdash;I&rsquo;ll read you a line from it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flew out of the room. A shadow blurred the sunlight in Nancy&rsquo;s face&mdash;there
      was uneasiness in it, and disappointment. A procession of disturbing
      thoughts began to troop through her mind. Saying nothing aloud, she sat
      with her hands in her lap; now and then she clasped them, then unclasped
      them, then tapped the ends of the fingers together; sighed, nodded, smiled&mdash;occasionally
      paused, shook her head. This pantomime was the elocutionary expression of
      an unspoken soliloquy which had something of this shape:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid of it&mdash;was afraid of it. Trying to make our fortune in
      Virginia, Beriah Sellers nearly ruined us and we had to settle in Kentucky
      and start over again. Trying to make our fortune in Kentucky he crippled
      us again and we had to move here. Trying to make our fortune here, he
      brought us clear down to the ground, nearly. He&rsquo;s an honest soul, and
      means the very best in the world, but I&rsquo;m afraid, I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s too
      flighty. He has splendid ideas, and he&rsquo;ll divide his chances with his
      friends with a free hand, the good generous soul, but something does seem
      to always interfere and spoil everything. I never did think he was right
      well balanced. But I don&rsquo;t blame my husband, for I do think that when that
      man gets his head full of a new notion, he can out-talk a machine. He&rsquo;ll
      make anybody believe in that notion that&rsquo;ll listen to him ten minutes&mdash;why
      I do believe he would make a deaf and dumb man believe in it and get
      beside himself, if you only set him where he could see his eyes tally and
      watch his hands explain. What a head he has got! When he got up that idea
      there in Virginia of buying up whole loads of negroes in Delaware and
      Virginia and Tennessee, very quiet, having papers drawn to have them
      delivered at a place in Alabama and take them and pay for them, away
      yonder at a certain time, and then in the meantime get a law made stopping
      everybody from selling negroes to the south after a certain day&mdash;it
      was somehow that way&mdash;mercy how the man would have made money!
      Negroes would have gone up to four prices. But after he&rsquo;d spent money and
      worked hard, and traveled hard, and had heaps of negroes all contracted
      for, and everything going along just right, he couldn&rsquo;t get the laws
      passed and down the whole thing tumbled. And there in Kentucky, when he
      raked up that old numskull that had been inventing away at a perpetual
      motion machine for twenty-two years, and Beriah Sellers saw at a glance
      where just one more little cog-wheel would settle the business, why I
      could see it as plain as day when he came in wild at midnight and hammered
      us out of bed and told the whole thing in a whisper with the doors bolted
      and the candle in an empty barrel.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Oceans of money in it&mdash;anybody could see that. But it did cost a deal
      to buy the old numskull out&mdash;and then when they put the new cog wheel
      in they&rsquo;d overlooked something somewhere and it wasn&rsquo;t any use&mdash;the
      troublesome thing wouldn&rsquo;t go. That notion he got up here did look as
      handy as anything in the world; and how him and Si did sit up nights
      working at it with the curtains down and me watching to see if any
      neighbors were about. The man did honestly believe there was a fortune in
      that black gummy oil that stews out of the bank Si says is coal; and he
      refined it himself till it was like water, nearly, and it did burn,
      there&rsquo;s no two ways about that; and I reckon he&rsquo;d have been all right in
      Cincinnati with his lamp that he got made, that time he got a house full
      of rich speculators to see him exhibit only in the middle of his speech it
      let go and almost blew the heads off the whole crowd.<br /> <br /> <br />

    </p>
    <p>
      I haven&rsquo;t got over grieving for the money that cost yet. I am sorry enough
      Beriah Sellers is in Missouri, now, but I was glad when he went. I wonder
      what his letter says. But of course it&rsquo;s cheerful; he&rsquo;s never down-hearted&mdash;never
      had any trouble in his life&mdash;didn&rsquo;t know it if he had. It&rsquo;s always
      sunrise with that man, and fine and blazing, at that&mdash;never gets
      noon, though&mdash;leaves off and rises again. Nobody can help liking the
      creature, he means so well&mdash;but I do dread to come across him again;
      he&rsquo;s bound to set us all crazy, of course. Well, there goes old widow
      Hopkins&mdash;it always takes her a week to buy a spool of thread and
      trade a hank of yarn. Maybe Si can come with the letter, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he did:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Widow Hopkins kept me&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t any patience with such tedious
      people. Now listen, Nancy&mdash;just listen at this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Come right along to Missouri! Don&rsquo;t wait and worry about a good price
        but sell out for whatever you can get, and come along, or you might be
        too late. Throw away your traps, if necessary, and come empty-handed.
        You&rsquo;ll never regret it. It&rsquo;s the grandest country&mdash;the loveliest
        land&mdash;the purest atmosphere&mdash;I can&rsquo;t describe it; no pen can
        do it justice. And it&rsquo;s filling up, every day&mdash;people coming from
        everywhere. I&rsquo;ve got the biggest scheme on earth&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll take you
        in; I&rsquo;ll take in every friend I&rsquo;ve got that&rsquo;s ever stood by me, for
        there&rsquo;s enough for all, and to spare. Mum&rsquo;s the word&mdash;don&rsquo;t whisper&mdash;keep
        yourself to yourself. You&rsquo;ll see! Come! &mdash;rush!&mdash;hurry!&mdash;don&rsquo;t
        wait for anything!&rsquo;
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same old boy, Nancy, jest the same old boy&mdash;ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think there&rsquo;s a little of the old sound about his voice yet. I
      suppose you&mdash;you&rsquo;ll still go, Si?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go! Well, I should think so, Nancy. It&rsquo;s all a chance, of course, and,
      chances haven&rsquo;t been kind to us, I&rsquo;ll admit&mdash;but whatever comes, old
      wife, they&rsquo;re provided for. Thank God for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; came low and earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with an activity and a suddenness that bewildered Obedstown and almost
      took its breath away, the Hawkinses hurried through with their
      arrangements in four short months and flitted out into the great
      mysterious blank that lay beyond the Knobs of Tennessee.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the close of the third day&rsquo;s journey the wayfarers were just
      beginning to think of camping, when they came upon a log cabin in the
      woods. Hawkins drew rein and entered the yard. A boy about ten years old
      was sitting in the cabin door with his face bowed in his hands. Hawkins
      approached, expecting his footfall to attract attention, but it did not.
      He halted a moment, and then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, little chap, you mustn&rsquo;t be going to sleep before sundown&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a tired expression the small face came up out of the hands,&mdash;a
      face down which tears were flowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m sorry I spoke so, my boy. Tell me&mdash;is anything the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy signified with a scarcely perceptible gesture that the trouble was
      in the house, and made room for Hawkins to pass. Then he put his face in
      his hands again and rocked himself about as one suffering a grief that is
      too deep to find help in moan or groan or outcry. Hawkins stepped within.
      It was a poverty stricken place. Six or eight middle-aged country people
      of both sexes were grouped about an object in the middle of the room; they
      were noiselessly busy and they talked in whispers when they spoke. Hawkins
      uncovered and approached. A coffin stood upon two backless chairs. These
      neighbors had just finished disposing the body of a woman in it&mdash;a
      woman with a careworn, gentle face that had more the look of sleep about
      it than of death. An old lady motioned, toward the door and said to
      Hawkins in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mother, po&rsquo; thing. Died of the fever, last night. Tha warn&rsquo;t no sich
      thing as saving of her. But it&rsquo;s better for her&mdash;better for her.
      Husband and the other two children died in the spring, and she hain&rsquo;t ever
      hilt up her head sence. She jest went around broken-hearted like, and
      never took no intrust in anything but Clay&mdash;that&rsquo;s the boy thar. She
      jest worshiped Clay&mdash;and Clay he worshiped her. They didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;pear to
      live at all, only when they was together, looking at each other, loving
      one another. She&rsquo;s ben sick three weeks; and if you believe me that child
      has worked, and kep&rsquo; the run of the med&rsquo;cin, and the times of giving it,
      and sot up nights and nussed her, and tried to keep up her sperits, the
      same as a grown-up person. And last night when she kep&rsquo; a sinking and
      sinking, and turned away her head and didn&rsquo;t know him no mo&rsquo;, it was
      fitten to make a body&rsquo;s heart break to see him climb onto the bed and lay
      his cheek agin hern and call her so pitiful and she not answer. But bymeby
      she roused up, like, and looked around wild, and then she see him, and she
      made a great cry and snatched him to her breast and hilt him close and
      kissed him over and over agin; but it took the last po&rsquo; strength she had,
      and so her eyelids begin to close down, and her arms sort o&rsquo; drooped away
      and then we see she was gone, po&rsquo; creetur. And Clay, he&mdash;Oh, the po&rsquo;
      motherless thing&mdash;I cain&rsquo;t talk about it&mdash;I cain&rsquo;t bear to talk
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clay had disappeared from the door; but he came in, now, and the neighbors
      reverently fell apart and made way for him. He leaned upon the open coffin
      and let his tears course silently. Then he put out his small hand and
      smoothed the hair and stroked the dead face lovingly. After a bit he
      brought his other hand up from behind him and laid three or four fresh
      wild flowers upon the breast, bent over and kissed the unresponsive lips
      time and time again, and then turned away and went out of the house
      without looking at any of the company. The old lady said to Hawkins:

      &ldquo;She always loved that kind o&rsquo; flowers. He fetched &lsquo;em for her every
      morning, and she always kissed him. They was from away north somers&mdash;she
      kep&rsquo; school when she fust come. Goodness knows what&rsquo;s to become o&rsquo; that
      po&rsquo; boy. No father, no mother, no kin folks of no kind. Nobody to go to,
      nobody that k&rsquo;yers for him&mdash;and all of us is so put to it for to get
      along and families so large.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins understood. All eyes were turned inquiringly upon him. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends, I am not very well provided for, myself, but still I would not
      turn my back on a homeless orphan. If he will go with me I will give him a
      home, and loving regard&mdash;I will do for him as I would have another do
      for a child of my own in misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One after another the people stepped forward and wrung the stranger&rsquo;s hand
      with cordial good will, and their eyes looked all that their hands could
      not express or their lips speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Said like a true man,&rdquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You was a stranger to me a minute ago, but you ain&rsquo;t now,&rdquo; said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bread cast upon the waters&mdash;it&rsquo;ll return after many days,&rdquo; said
      the old lady whom we have heard speak before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got to camp in my house as long as you hang out here,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;If
      tha hain&rsquo;t room for you and yourn my tribe&rsquo;ll turn out and camp in the hay
      loft.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes afterward, while the preparations for the funeral were being
      concluded, Mr. Hawkins arrived at his wagon leading his little waif by the
      hand, and told his wife all that had happened, and asked her if he had
      done right in giving to her and to himself this new care? She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve done wrong, Si Hawkins, it&rsquo;s a wrong that will shine brighter
      at the judgment day than the rights that many a man has done before you.
      And there isn&rsquo;t any compliment you can pay me equal to doing a thing like
      this and finishing it up, just taking it for granted that I&rsquo;ll be willing
      to it. Willing? Come to me; you poor motherless boy, and let me take your
      grief and help you carry it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the child awoke in the morning, it was as if from a troubled dream.
      But slowly the confusion in his mind took form, and he remembered his
      great loss; the beloved form in the coffin; his talk with a generous
      stranger who offered him a home; the funeral, where the stranger&rsquo;s wife
      held him by the hand at the grave, and cried with him and comforted him;
      and he remembered how this, new mother tucked him in his bed in the
      neighboring farm house, and coaxed him to talk about his troubles, and
      then heard him say his prayers and kissed him good night, and left him
      with the soreness in his heart almost healed and his bruised spirit at
      rest.

      And now the new mother came again, and helped him to dress, and combed his
      hair, and drew his mind away by degrees from the dismal yesterday, by
      telling him about the wonderful journey he was going to take and the
      strange things he was going to see. And after breakfast they two went
      alone to the grave, and his heart went out to his new friend and his
      untaught eloquence poured the praises of his buried idol into her ears
      without let or hindrance. Together they planted roses by the headboard and
      strewed wild flowers upon the grave; and then together they went away,
      hand in hand, and left the dead to the long sleep that heals all
      heart-aches and ends all sorrows.

      Whatever the lagging dragging journey may have been to the rest of the
      emigrants, it was a wonder and delight to the children, a world of
      enchantment; and they believed it to be peopled with the mysterious dwarfs
      and giants and goblins that figured in the tales the negro slaves were in
      the habit of telling them nightly by the shuddering light of the kitchen
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of nearly a week of travel, the party went into camp near a
      shabby village which was caving, house by house, into the hungry
      Mississippi. The river astonished the children beyond measure. Its
      mile-breadth of water seemed an ocean to them, in the shadowy twilight,
      and the vague riband of trees on the further shore, the verge of a
      continent which surely none but they had ever seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Dan&rsquo;l&rdquo; (colored,) aged 40; his wife, &ldquo;aunt Jinny,&rdquo; aged 30, &ldquo;Young
      Miss&rdquo; Emily Hawkins, &ldquo;Young Mars&rdquo; Washington Hawkins and &ldquo;Young Mars&rdquo;
       Clay, the new member of the family, ranged themselves on a log, after
      supper, and contemplated the marvelous river and discussed it. The moon
      rose and sailed aloft through a maze of shredded cloud-wreaths; the sombre
      river just perceptibly brightened under the veiled light; a deep silence
      pervaded the air and was emphasized, at intervals, rather than broken, by
      the hooting of an owl, the baying of a dog, or the muffled crash of a
      carving bank in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little company assembled on the log were all children (at least in
      simplicity and broad and comprehensive ignorance,) and the remarks they
      made about the river were in keeping with the character; and so awed were
      they by the grandeur and the solemnity of the scene before them, and by
      their belief that the air was filled with invisible spirits and that the
      faint zephyrs were caused by their passing wings, that all their talk took
      to itself a tinge of the supernatural, and their voices were subdued to a
      low and reverent tone. Suddenly Uncle Dan&rsquo;l exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chil&rsquo;en, dah&rsquo;s sum fin a comin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p036" id="p036"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      All crowded close together and every heart beat faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Dan&rsquo;l pointed down the river with his bony finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep coughing sound troubled the stillness, way toward a wooded cape
      that jetted into the stream a mile distant. All in an instant a fierce eye
      of fire shot out from behind the cape and sent a long brilliant pathway
      quivering athwart the dusky water. The coughing grew louder and louder,
      the glaring eye grew larger and still larger, glared wilder and still
      wilder. A huge shape developed itself out of the gloom, and from its tall
      duplicate horns dense volumes of smoke, starred and spangled with sparks,
      poured out and went tumbling away into the farther darkness. Nearer and
      nearer the thing came, till its long sides began to glow with spots of
      light which mirrored themselves in the river and attended the monster like
      a torchlight procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it! Oh, what is it, Uncle Dan&rsquo;l!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With deep solemnity the answer came:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s de Almighty! Git down on yo&rsquo; knees!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not necessary to say it twice. They were all kneeling, in a moment.
      And then while the mysterious coughing rose stronger and stronger and the
      threatening glare reached farther and wider, the negro&rsquo;s voice lifted up
      its supplications:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lord&rsquo;, we&rsquo;s ben mighty wicked, an&rsquo; we knows dat we &lsquo;zerve to go to de
      bad place, but good Lord, deah Lord, we ain&rsquo;t ready yit, we ain&rsquo;t ready&mdash;let
      dese po&rsquo; chilen hab one mo&rsquo; chance, jes&rsquo; one mo&rsquo; chance. Take de ole
      niggah if you&rsquo;s got to hab somebody.&mdash;Good Lord, good deah Lord, we
      don&rsquo;t know whah you&rsquo;s a gwyne to, we don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;s got yo&rsquo; eye on,
      but we knows by de way you&rsquo;s a comin&rsquo;, we knows by de way you&rsquo;s a tiltin&rsquo;
      along in yo&rsquo; charyot o&rsquo; fiah dat some po&rsquo; sinner&rsquo;s a gwyne to ketch it.
      But good Lord, dose chilen don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;long heah, dey&rsquo;s f&rsquo;m Obedstown whah dey
      don&rsquo;t know nuffin, an&rsquo; you knows, yo&rsquo; own sef, dat dey ain&rsquo;t &lsquo;sponsible.
      An&rsquo; deah Lord, good Lord, it ain&rsquo;t like yo&rsquo; mercy, it ain&rsquo;t like yo&rsquo; pity,
      it ain&rsquo;t like yo&rsquo; long-sufferin&rsquo; lovin&rsquo; kindness for to take dis kind o&rsquo;
      &lsquo;vantage o&rsquo; sick little chil&rsquo;en as dose is when dey&rsquo;s so many ornery grown
      folks chuck full o&rsquo; cussedness dat wants roastin&rsquo; down dah. Oh, Lord, spah
      de little chil&rsquo;en, don&rsquo;t tar de little chil&rsquo;en away f&rsquo;m dey frens, jes&rsquo;
      let &lsquo;em off jes&rsquo; dis once, and take it out&rsquo;n de ole niggah. HEAH I IS,
      LORD, HEAH I IS! De ole niggah&rsquo;s ready, Lord, de ole&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The flaming and churning steamer was right abreast the party, and not
      twenty steps away. The awful thunder of a mud-valve suddenly burst forth,
      drowning the prayer, and as suddenly Uncle Dan&rsquo;l snatched a child under
      each arm and scoured into the woods with the rest of the pack at his
      heels. And then, ashamed of himself, he halted in the deep darkness and
      shouted, (but rather feebly:)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heah I is, Lord, heah I is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment of throbbing suspense, and then, to the surprise and
      the comfort of the party, it was plain that the august presence had gone
      by, for its dreadful noises were receding. Uncle Dan&rsquo;l headed a cautious
      reconnaissance in the direction of the log. Sure enough &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; was
      just turning a point a short distance up the river, and while they looked
      the lights winked out and the coughing diminished by degrees and presently
      ceased altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H&rsquo;wsh! Well now dey&rsquo;s some folks says dey ain&rsquo;t no &lsquo;ficiency in prah. Dis
      Chile would like to know whah we&rsquo;d a ben now if it warn&rsquo;t fo&rsquo; dat prah?
      Dat&rsquo;s it. Dat&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Dan&rsquo;l, do you reckon it was the prayer that saved us?&rdquo; said Clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does I reckon? Don&rsquo;t I know it! Whah was yo&rsquo; eyes? Warn&rsquo;t de Lord jes&rsquo; a
      cumin&rsquo; chow! chow! CHOW! an&rsquo; a goin&rsquo; on turrible&mdash;an&rsquo; do de Lord

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you reckon he saw, us, Uncle Dan&rsquo;l?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De law sakes, Chile, didn&rsquo;t I see him a lookin&rsquo; at us?&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you feel scared, Uncle Dan&rsquo;l?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sah! When a man is &lsquo;gaged in prah, he ain&rsquo;t fraid o&rsquo; nuffin&mdash;dey
      can&rsquo;t nuffin tetch him.&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;Well what did you run for?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;I&mdash;mars Clay, when a man is under de influence ob de

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but what they were girls. I think they were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now mars Clay, you knows bettern dat. Sometimes a body can&rsquo;t tell whedder

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how should I know whether they were boys or girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goodness sakes, mars Clay, don&rsquo;t de Good Book say? &lsquo;Sides, don&rsquo;t it call

     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Uncle Dan&rsquo;l, I think that&mdash;&mdash;-My! here comes another one
      up the river! There can&rsquo;t be two!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We gone dis time&mdash;we done gone dis time, sho&rsquo;! Dey ain&rsquo;t two, mars
      Clay&mdash;days de same one. De Lord kin &lsquo;pear eberywhah in a second.

     </p>
    <p>
      He did go to the woods and pray; but he went so far that he doubted,
      himself, if the Lord heard him when He went by.

      Early in the morning Squire Hawkins took passage in a small steamboat,
      with his family and his two slaves, and presently the bell rang, the
      stage-plank was hauled in, and the vessel proceeded up the river. The
      children and the slaves were not much more at ease after finding out that
      this monster was a creature of human contrivance than they were the night
      before when they thought it the Lord of heaven and earth. They started, in
      fright, every time the gauge-cocks sent out an angry hiss, and they quaked
      from head to foot when the mud-valves thundered. The shivering of the boat
      under the beating of the wheels was sheer misery to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of course familiarity with these things soon took away their terrors,
      and then the voyage at once became a glorious adventure, a royal progress
      through the very heart and home of romance, a realization of their rosiest
      wonder-dreams. They sat by the hour in the shade of the pilot house on the
      hurricane deck and looked out over the curving expanses of the river
      sparkling in the sunlight. Sometimes the boat fought the mid-stream
      current, with a verdant world on either hand, and remote from both;
      sometimes she closed in under a point, where the dead water and the
      helping eddies were, and shaved the bank so closely that the decks were
      swept by the jungle of over-hanging willows and littered with a spoil of
      leaves; departing from these &ldquo;points&rdquo; she regularly crossed the river
      every five miles, avoiding the &ldquo;bight&rdquo; of the great binds and thus
      escaping the strong current; sometimes she went out and skirted a high
      &ldquo;bluff&rdquo; sand-bar in the middle of the stream, and occasionally followed it
      up a little too far and touched upon the shoal water at its head&mdash;and
      then the intelligent craft refused to run herself aground, but &ldquo;smelt&rdquo; the
      bar, and straightway the foamy streak that streamed away from her bows
      vanished, a great foamless wave rolled forward and passed her under way,
      and in this instant she leaned far over on her side, shied from the bar
      and fled square away from the danger like a frightened thing&mdash;and the
      pilot was lucky if he managed to &ldquo;straighten her up&rdquo; before she drove her
      nose into the opposite bank; sometimes she approached a solid wall of tall
      trees as if she meant to break through it, but all of a sudden a little
      crack would open just enough to admit her, and away she would go plowing
      through the &ldquo;chute&rdquo; with just barely room enough between the island on one
      side and the main land on the other; in this sluggish water she seemed to
      go like a racehorse; now and then small log cabins appeared in little
      clearings, with the never-failing frowsy women and girls in soiled and
      faded linsey-woolsey leaning in the doors or against woodpiles and rail
      fences, gazing sleepily at the passing show; sometimes she found shoal
      water, going out at the head of those &ldquo;chutes&rdquo; or crossing the river, and
      then a deck-hand stood on the bow and hove the lead, while the boat slowed
      down and moved cautiously; sometimes she stopped a moment at a landing and
      took on some freight or a passenger while a crowd of slouchy white men and
      negroes stood on the bank and looked sleepily on with their hands in their
      pantaloons pockets,&mdash;of course&mdash;for they never took them out
      except to stretch, and when they did this they squirmed about and reached
      their fists up into the air and lifted themselves on tip-toe in an ecstasy
      of enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sun went down it turned all the broad river to a national banner
      laid in gleaming bars of gold and purple and crimson; and in time these
      glories faded out in the twilight and left the fairy archipelagoes
      reflecting their fringing foliage in the steely mirror of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night the boat forged on through the deep solitudes of the river,
      hardly ever discovering a light to testify to a human presence&mdash;mile
      after mile and league after league the vast bends were guarded by unbroken
      walls of forest that had never been disturbed by the voice or the
      foot-fall of man or felt the edge of his sacrilegious axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour after supper the moon came up, and Clay and Washington ascended to
      the hurricane deck to revel again in their new realm of enchantment. They
      ran races up and down the deck; climbed about the bell; made friends with
      the passenger-dogs chained under the lifeboat; tried to make friends with
      a passenger-bear fastened to the verge-staff but were not encouraged;<br />

      amusement-possibilities of the deck. Then they looked wistfully up at the
      pilot house, and finally, little by little, Clay ventured up there,
      followed diffidently by Washington. The pilot turned presently to &ldquo;get his
      stern-marks,&rdquo; saw the lads and invited them in. Now their happiness was
      complete. This cosy little house, built entirely of glass and commanding a
      marvelous prospect in every direction was a magician&rsquo;s throne to them and
      their enjoyment of the place was simply boundless.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat them down on a high bench and looked miles ahead and saw the
      wooded capes fold back and reveal the bends beyond; and they looked miles
      to the rear and saw the silvery highway diminish its breadth by degrees
      and close itself together in the distance. Presently the pilot said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, yonder comes the Amaranth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A spark appeared, close to the water, several miles down the river. The
      pilot took his glass and looked at it steadily for a moment, and said,
      chiefly to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be the Blue Wing. She couldn&rsquo;t pick us up this way. It&rsquo;s the
      Amaranth, sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bent over a speaking tube and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s on watch down there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hollow, unhuman voice rumbled up through the tube in answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am. Second engineer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! You want to stir your stumps, now, Harry&mdash;the Amaranth&rsquo;s just
      turned the point&mdash;and she&rsquo;s just a&mdash;humping herself, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pilot took hold of a rope that stretched out forward, jerked it twice,
      and two mellow strokes of the big bell responded. A voice out on the deck
      shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by, down there, with that labboard lead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t want the lead,&rdquo; said the pilot, &ldquo;I want you. Roust out the
      old man&mdash;tell him the Amaranth&rsquo;s coming. And go and call Jim&mdash;tell
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye-aye, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;old man&rdquo; was the captain&mdash;he is always called so, on steamboats
      and ships; &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; was the other pilot. Within two minutes both of these men
      were flying up the pilothouse stairway, three steps at a jump. Jim was in
      his shirt sleeves,&mdash;with his coat and vest on his arm. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just turning in. Where&rsquo;s the glass&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took it and looked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t appear to be any night-hawk on the jack-staff&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
      Amaranth, dead sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain took a good long look, and only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damnation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Davis, the pilot on watch, shouted to the night-watchman on deck:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s she loaded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two inches by the head, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;T ain&rsquo;t enough!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain shouted, now:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call the mate. Tell him to call all hands and get a lot of that sugar
      forrard&mdash;put her ten inches by the head. Lively, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye-aye, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A riot of shouting and trampling floated up from below, presently, and the
      uneasy steering of the boat soon showed that she was getting &ldquo;down by the
      head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three men in the pilot house began to talk in short, sharp sentences,
      low and earnestly. As their excitement rose, their voices went down. As
      fast as one of them put down the spy-glass another took it up&mdash;but
      always with a studied air of calmness. Each time the verdict was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a gaining!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p045" id="p045"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p045.jpg (22K)" src="images/p045.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain spoke through the tube:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What steam are you carrying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred and forty-two, sir! But she&rsquo;s getting hotter and hotter all the
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat was straining and groaning and quivering like a monster in pain.
      Both pilots were at work now, one on each side of the wheel, with their
      coats and vests off, their bosoms and collars wide open and the
      perspiration flowing down heir faces. They were holding the boat so close
      to the shore that the willows swept the guards almost from stem to stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by!&rdquo; whispered George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; said Jim, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat sprang away from the bank like a deer, and darted in a long
      diagonal toward the other shore. She closed in again and thrashed her
      fierce way along the willows as before. The captain put down the glass:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord how she walks up on us! I do hate to be beat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said George, looking straight ahead, watching the slightest yawing
      of the boat and promptly meeting it with the wheel, &ldquo;how&rsquo;ll it do to try
      Murderer&rsquo;s Chute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s taking chances. How was the cottonwood stump on the
      false point below Boardman&rsquo;s Island this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water just touching the roots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well it&rsquo;s pretty close work. That gives six feet scant in the head of
      Murderer&rsquo;s Chute. We can just barely rub through if we hit it exactly
      right. But it&rsquo;s worth trying. She don&rsquo;t dare tackle it!&rdquo;&mdash;meaning the
      Amaranth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another instant the Boreas plunged into what seemed a crooked creek,
      and the Amaranth&rsquo;s approaching lights were shut out in a moment. Not a
      whisper was uttered, now, but the three men stared ahead into the shadows
      and two of them spun the wheel back and forth with anxious watchfulness
      while the steamer tore along. The chute seemed to come to an end every
      fifty yards, but always opened out in time. Now the head of it was at
      hand. George tapped the big bell three times, two leadsmen sprang to their
      posts, and in a moment their weird cries rose on the night air and were
      caught up and repeated by two men on the upper deck:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o bottom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;De-e-p four!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarter three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mark under wa-a-ter three!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half twain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarter twain!&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Davis pulled a couple of ropes&mdash;there was a jingling of small bells
      far below, the boat&rsquo;s speed slackened, and the pent steam began to whistle
      and the gauge-cocks to scream:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the mark twain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p047" id="p047"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p047.jpg (25K)" src="images/p047.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quar&mdash;ter&mdash;her&mdash;er&mdash;less twain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight and a half!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eight feet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven-ana-half!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another jingling of little bells and the wheels ceased turning altogether.
      The whistling of the steam was something frightful now&mdash;it almost
      drowned all other noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand by to meet her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George had the wheel hard down and was standing on a spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat hesitated&mdash;seemed to hold her breath, as did the captain and
      pilots&mdash;and then she began to fall away to starboard and every eye
      lighted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then!&mdash;meet her! meet her! Snatch her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wheel flew to port so fast that the spokes blended into a spider-web&mdash;the
      swing of the boat subsided&mdash;she steadied herself&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven feet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sev&mdash;six and a half!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six feet! Six f&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bang! She hit the bottom! George shouted through the tube:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spread her wide open! Whale it at her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pow-wow-chow! The escape-pipes belched snowy pillars of steam aloft, the
      boat ground and surged and trembled&mdash;and slid over into&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M-a-r-k twain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quarter-her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tap! tap! tap!&rdquo; (to signify &ldquo;Lay in the leads&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      And away she went, flying up the willow shore, with the whole silver sea
      of the Mississippi stretching abroad on every hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      No Amaranth in sight!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha-ha, boys, we took a couple of tricks that time!&rdquo; said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just at that moment a red glare appeared in the head of the chute and
      the Amaranth came springing after them!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I swear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jim, what is the meaning of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s the meaning of it. That hail we had at Napoleon was
      Wash Hastings, wanting to come to Cairo&mdash;and we didn&rsquo;t stop. He&rsquo;s in
      that pilot house, now, showing those mud turtles how to hunt for easy
      water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! I thought it wasn&rsquo;t any slouch that was running that middle
      bar in Hog-eye Bend. If it&rsquo;s Wash Hastings&mdash;well, what he don&rsquo;t know
      about the river ain&rsquo;t worth knowing&mdash;a regular gold-leaf, kid-glove,
      diamond breastpin pilot Wash Hastings is. We won&rsquo;t take any tricks off of
      him, old man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d a stopped for him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Amaranth was within three hundred yards of the Boreas, and still
      gaining. The &ldquo;old man&rdquo; spoke through the tube:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is she-carrying now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred and sixty-five, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your wood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pine all out-cypress half gone-eating up cotton-wood like pie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break into that rosin on the main deck-pile it in, the boat can pay for
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon the boat was plunging and quivering and screaming more madly than
      ever. But the Amaranth&rsquo;s head was almost abreast the Boreas&rsquo;s stern:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s your steam, now, Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hundred and eighty-two, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break up the casks of bacon in the forrard hold! Pile it in! Levy on that
      turpentine in the fantail-drench every stick of wood with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat was a moving earthquake by this time:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is she now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred and ninety-six and still a-swelling!&mdash;water, below the
      middle gauge-cocks!&mdash;carrying every pound she can stand!&mdash;nigger
      roosting on the safety-valve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! How&rsquo;s your draft?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully! Every time a nigger heaves a stick of wood into the furnace he
      goes out the chimney, with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Amaranth drew steadily up till her jack-staff breasted the Boreas&rsquo;s
      wheel-house&mdash;climbed along inch by inch till her chimneys breasted it&mdash;crept
      along, further and further, till the boats were wheel to wheel&mdash;and
      then they closed up with a heavy jolt and locked together tight and fast
      in the middle of the big river under the flooding moonlight! A roar and a
      hurrah went up from the crowded decks of both steamers&mdash;all hands
      rushed to the guards to look and shout and gesticulate&mdash;the weight
      careened the vessels over toward each other&mdash;officers flew hither and
      thither cursing and storming, trying to drive the people amidships&mdash;both
      captains were leaning over their railings shaking their fists, swearing
      and threatening&mdash;black volumes of smoke rolled up and canopied the
      scene,&mdash;delivering a rain of sparks upon the vessels&mdash;two pistol
      shots rang out, and both captains dodged unhurt and the packed masses of
      passengers surged back and fell apart while the shrieks of women and
      children soared above the intolerable din&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p048" id="p048"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p048.jpg (76K)" src="images/p048.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was a booming roar, a thundering crash, and the riddled
      Amaranth dropped loose from her hold and drifted helplessly away!
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly the fire-doors of the Boreas were thrown open and the men began
      dashing buckets of water into the furnaces&mdash;for it would have been
      death and destruction to stop the engines with such a head of steam on.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as possible the Boreas dropped down to the floating wreck and took
      off the dead, the wounded and the unhurt&mdash;at least all that could be
      got at, for the whole forward half of the boat was a shapeless ruin, with
      the great chimneys lying crossed on top of it, and underneath were a dozen
      victims imprisoned alive and wailing for help. While men with axes worked
      with might and main to free these poor fellows, the Boreas&rsquo;s boats went
      about, picking up stragglers from the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now a new horror presented itself. The wreck took fire from the
      dismantled furnaces! Never did men work with a heartier will than did
      those stalwart braves with the axes. But it was of no use. The fire ate
      its way steadily, despising the bucket brigade that fought it. It scorched
      the clothes, it singed the hair of the axemen&mdash;it drove them back,
      foot by foot&mdash;inch by inch&mdash;they wavered, struck a final blow in
      the teeth of the enemy, and surrendered. And as they fell back they heard
      prisoned voices saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave us! Don&rsquo;t desert us! Don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And one poor fellow said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Henry Worley, striker of the Amaranth! My mother lives in St. Louis.
      Tell her a lie for a poor devil&rsquo;s sake, please. Say I was killed in an
      instant and never knew what hurt me&mdash;though God knows I&rsquo;ve neither
      scratch nor bruise this moment! It&rsquo;s hard to burn up in a coop like this
      with the whole wide world so near. Good-bye boys&mdash;we&rsquo;ve all got to
      come to it at last, anyway!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Boreas stood away out of danger, and the ruined steamer went drifting
      down the stream an island of wreathing and climbing flame that vomited
      clouds of smoke from time to time, and glared more fiercely and sent its
      luminous tongues higher and higher after each emission. A shriek at
      intervals told of a captive that had met his doom. The wreck lodged upon a
      sandbar, and when the Boreas turned the next point on her upward journey
      it was still burning with scarcely abated fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boys came down into the main saloon of the Boreas, they saw a
      pitiful sight and heard a world of pitiful sounds. Eleven poor creatures
      lay dead and forty more lay moaning, or pleading or screaming, while a
      score of Good Samaritans moved among them doing what they could to relieve
      their sufferings; bathing their chinless faces and bodies with linseed oil
      and lime water and covering the places with bulging masses of raw cotton
      that gave to every face and form a dreadful and unhuman aspect.

    <p>
      A little wee French midshipman of fourteen lay fearfully injured, but
      never uttered a sound till a physician of Memphis was about to dress his
      hurts. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I get well? You need not be afraid to tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I&mdash;I am afraid you can not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do not waste your time with me&mdash;help those that can get well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help those that can get well! It is, not for me to be a girl. I carry the
      blood of eleven generations of soldiers in my veins!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician&mdash;himself a man who had seen service in the navy in his
      time&mdash;touched his hat to this little hero, and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The head engineer of the Amaranth, a grand specimen of physical manhood,
      struggled to his feet a ghastly spectacle and strode toward his brother,
      the second engineer, who was unhurt. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were on watch. You were boss. You would not listen to me when I
      begged you to reduce your steam. Take that!&mdash;take it to my wife and
      tell her it comes from me by the hand of my murderer! Take it&mdash;and
      take my curse with it to blister your heart a hundred years&mdash;and may
      you live so long!&rdquo;

      And he tore a ring from his finger, stripping flesh and skin with it,
      threw it down and fell dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      But these things must not be dwelt upon. The Boreas landed her dreadful
      cargo at the next large town and delivered it over to a multitude of eager
      hands and warm southern hearts&mdash;a cargo amounting by this time to 39
      wounded persons and 22 dead bodies. And with these she delivered a list of
      96 missing persons that had drowned or otherwise perished at the scene of
      the disaster.

    <p>
      A jury of inquest was impaneled, and after due deliberation and inquiry
      they returned the inevitable American verdict which has been so familiar
      to our ears all the days of our lives&mdash;&ldquo;NOBODY TO BLAME.&rdquo;

      When the Boreas backed away from the land to continue her voyage up the
      river, the Hawkinses were richer by twenty-four hours of experience in the
      contemplation of human suffering and in learning through honest hard work
      how to relieve it. And they were richer in another way also. In the early
      turmoil an hour after the explosion, a little black-eyed girl of five
      years, frightened and crying bitterly, was struggling through the throng
      in the Boreas&rsquo; saloon calling her mother and father, but no one answered.
      Something in the face of Mr. Hawkins attracted her and she came and looked
      up at him; was satisfied, and took refuge with him. He petted her,
      listened to her troubles, and said he would find her friends for her. Then
      he put her in a state-room with his children and told them to be kind to
      her (the adults of his party were all busy with the wounded) and
      straightway began his search.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fruitless. But all day he and his wife made inquiries, and hoped
      against hope. All that they could learn was that the child and her parents
      came on board at New Orleans, where they had just arrived in a vessel from
      Cuba; that they looked like people from the Atlantic States; that the
      family name was Van Brunt and the child&rsquo;s name Laura. This was all. The
      parents had not been seen since the explosion. The child&rsquo;s manners were
      those of a little lady, and her clothes were daintier and finer than any
      Mrs. Hawkins had ever seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the hours dragged on the child lost heart, and cried so piteously for
      her mother that it seemed to the Hawkinses that the moanings and the
      wailings of the mutilated men and women in the saloon did not so strain at
      their heart-strings as the sufferings of this little desolate creature.
      They tried hard to comfort her; and in trying, learned to love her; they
      could not help it, seeing how she clung, to them and put her arms about
      their necks and found no solace but in their kind eyes and comforting
      words: There was a question in both their hearts&mdash;a question that
      rose up and asserted itself with more and more pertinacity as the hours
      wore on&mdash;but both hesitated to give it voice&mdash;both kept silence&mdash;and&mdash;waited.
      But a time came at last when the matter would bear delay no longer. The
      boat had landed, and the dead and the wounded were being conveyed to the
      shore. The tired child was asleep in the arms of Mrs. Hawkins. Mr. Hawkins
      came into their presence and stood without speaking. His eyes met his
      wife&rsquo;s; then both looked at the child&mdash;and as they looked it stirred
      in its sleep and nestled closer; an expression of contentment and peace
      settled upon its face that touched the mother-heart; and when the eyes of
      husband and wife met again, the question was asked and answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Boreas had journeyed some four hundred miles from the time the
      Hawkinses joined her, a long rank of steamboats was sighted, packed side
      by side at a wharf like sardines, in a box, and above and beyond them rose
      the domes and steeples and general architectural confusion of a city&mdash;a
      city with an imposing umbrella of black smoke spread over it. This was St.
      Louis. The children of the Hawkins family were playing about the hurricane
      deck, and the father and mother were sitting in the lee of the pilot house
      essaying to keep order and not greatly grieved that they were not
      succeeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re worth all the trouble they are, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and more, Si.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you! You wouldn&rsquo;t sell one of them at a good round figure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for all the money in the bank, Si.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own sentiments every time. It is true we are not rich&mdash;but still
      you are not sorry&mdash;-you haven&rsquo;t any misgivings about the additions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. God will provide&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen. And so you wouldn&rsquo;t even part with Clay? Or Laura!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for anything in the world. I love them just the same as I love my
      own: They pet me and spoil me even more than the others do, I think. I
      reckon we&rsquo;ll get along, Si.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, it will all come out right, old mother. I wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid to
      adopt a thousand children if I wanted to, for there&rsquo;s that Tennessee Land,
      you know&mdash;enough to make an army of them rich. A whole army, Nancy!
      You and I will never see the day, but these little chaps will. Indeed they
      will. One of these days it will be the rich Miss Emily Hawkins&mdash;and
      the wealthy Miss Laura Van Brunt Hawkins&mdash;and the Hon. George
      Washington Hawkins, millionaire&mdash;and Gov. Henry Clay Hawkins,
      millionaire! That is the way the world will word it! Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s ever fret
      about the children, Nancy&mdash;never in the world. They&rsquo;re all right.
      Nancy, there&rsquo;s oceans and oceans of money in that land&mdash;mark my
      words!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The children had stopped playing, for the moment, and drawn near to
      listen. Hawkins said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washington, my boy, what will you do when you get to be one of the
      richest men in the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, father. Sometimes I think I&rsquo;ll have a balloon and go up in
      the air; and sometimes I think I&rsquo;ll have ever so many books; and sometimes
      I think I&rsquo;ll have ever so many weathercocks and water-wheels; or have a
      machine like that one you and Colonel Sellers bought; and sometimes I
      think I&rsquo;ll have&mdash;well, somehow I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;somehow I ain&rsquo;t
      certain; maybe I&rsquo;ll get a steamboat first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The same old chap!&mdash;always just a little bit divided about things.&mdash;And
      what will you do when you get to be one of the richest men in the world,
      Clay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir. My mother&mdash;my other mother that&rsquo;s gone away&mdash;she
      always told me to work along and not be much expecting to get rich, and
      then I wouldn&rsquo;t be disappointed if I didn&rsquo;t get rich. And so I reckon it&rsquo;s
      better for me to wait till I get rich, and then by that time maybe I&rsquo;ll
      know what I&rsquo;ll want&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t now, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Careful old head!&mdash;Governor Henry Clay Hawkins!&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
      you&rsquo;ll be, Clay, one of these days. Wise old head! weighty old head! Go
      on, now, and play&mdash;all of you. It&rsquo;s a prime lot, Nancy; as the
      Obedstown folk say about their hogs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A smaller steamboat received the Hawkinses and their fortunes, and bore
      them a hundred and thirty miles still higher up the Mississippi, and
      landed them at a little tumble-down village on the Missouri shore in the
      twilight of a mellow October day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning they harnessed up their team and for two days they wended
      slowly into the interior through almost roadless and uninhabited forest
      solitudes. And when for the last time they pitched their tents,
      metaphorically speaking, it was at the goal of their hopes, their new
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the muddy roadside stood a new log cabin, one story high&mdash;the
      store; clustered in the neighborhood were ten or twelve more cabins, some
      new, some old.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sad light of the departing day the place looked homeless enough.
      Two or three coatless young men sat in front of the store on a dry-goods
      box, and whittled it with their knives, kicked it with their vast boots,
      and shot tobacco-juice at various marks. Several ragged negroes leaned
      comfortably against the posts of the awning and contemplated the arrival
      of the wayfarers with lazy curiosity. All these people presently managed
      to drag themselves to the vicinity of the Hawkins&rsquo; wagon, and there they
      took up permanent positions, hands in pockets and resting on one leg; and
      thus anchored they proceeded to look and enjoy. Vagrant dogs came wagging
      around and making inquiries of Hawkins&rsquo;s dog, which were not satisfactory
      and they made war on him in concert. This would have interested the
      citizens but it was too many on one to amount to anything as a fight, and
      so they commanded the peace and the foreign dog coiled his tail and took
      sanctuary under the wagon. Slatternly negro girls and women slouched along
      with pails deftly balanced on their heads, and joined the group and
      stared. Little half dressed white boys, and little negro boys with nothing
      whatever on but tow-linen shirts with a fine southern exposure, came from
      various directions and stood with their hands locked together behind them
      and aided in the inspection. The rest of the population were laying down
      their employments and getting ready to come, when a man burst through the
      assemblage and seized the new-comers by the hands in a frenzy of welcome,
      and exclaimed&mdash;indeed almost shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well who could have believed it! Now is it you sure enough&mdash;turn
      around! hold up your heads! I want to look at you good! Well, well, well,
      it does seem most too good to be true, I declare! Lord, I&rsquo;m so glad to see
      you! Does a body&rsquo;s whole soul good to look at you! Shake hands again! Keep
      on shaking hands! Goodness gracious alive. What will my wife say?&mdash;Oh
      yes indeed, it&rsquo;s so!&mdash;married only last week&mdash;lovely, perfectly
      lovely creature, the noblest woman that ever&mdash;you&rsquo;ll like her, Nancy!
      Like her? Lord bless me you&rsquo;ll love her&mdash;you&rsquo;ll dote on her&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
      be twins! Well, well, well, let me look at you again! Same old&mdash;why
      bless my life it was only jest this very morning that my wife says,
      &lsquo;Colonel&rsquo;&mdash;she will call me Colonel spite of everything I can do&mdash;she
      says &lsquo;Colonel, something tells me somebody&rsquo;s coming!&rsquo; and sure enough here
      you are, the last people on earth a body could have expected. Why she&rsquo;ll
      think she&rsquo;s a prophetess&mdash;and hanged if I don&rsquo;t think so too&mdash;and
      you know there ain&rsquo;t any country but what a prophet&rsquo;s an honor to, as the
      proverb says. Lord bless me and here&rsquo;s the children, too! Washington,
      Emily, don&rsquo;t you know me? Come, give us a kiss. Won&rsquo;t I fix you, though!&mdash;ponies,
      cows, dogs, everything you can think of that&rsquo;ll delight a child&rsquo;s heart&mdash;and&mdash;Why
      how&rsquo;s this? Little strangers? Well you won&rsquo;t be any strangers here, I can
      tell you. Bless your souls we&rsquo;ll make you think you never was at home
      before&mdash;&lsquo;deed and &lsquo;deed we will, I can tell you! Come, now, bundle
      right along with me. You can&rsquo;t glorify any hearth stone but mine in this
      camp, you know&mdash;can&rsquo;t eat anybody&rsquo;s bread but mine&mdash;can&rsquo;t do
      anything but just make yourselves perfectly at home and comfortable, and
      spread yourselves out and rest! You hear me! Here&mdash;Jim, Tom, Pete,
      Jake, fly around! Take that team to my place&mdash;put the wagon in my lot&mdash;put
      the horses under the shed, and get out hay and oats and fill them up!
      Ain&rsquo;t any hay and oats? Well get some&mdash;have it charged to me&mdash;come,
      spin around, now! Now, Hawkins, the procession&rsquo;s ready; mark time, by the
      left flank, forward-march!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the Colonel took the lead, with Laura astride his neck, and the
      newly-inspired and very grateful immigrants picked up their tired limbs
      with quite a spring in them and dropped into his wake.

      Presently they were ranged about an old-time fire-place whose blazing logs
      sent out rather an unnecessary amount of heat, but that was no matter&mdash;supper
      was needed, and to have it, it had to be cooked. This apartment was the
      family bedroom, parlor, library and kitchen, all in one. The matronly
      little wife of the Colonel moved hither and thither and in and out with
      her pots and pans in her hands, happiness in her heart and a world of
      admiration of her husband in her eyes.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And when at last she had spread the cloth and loaded it with hot corn
      bread, fried chickens, bacon, buttermilk, coffee, and all manner of
      country luxuries, Col. Sellers modified his harangue and for a moment
      throttled it down to the orthodox pitch for a blessing, and then instantly
      burst forth again as from a parenthesis and clattered on with might and
      main till every stomach in the party was laden with all it could carry.
      And when the new-comers ascended the ladder to their comfortable feather
      beds on the second floor&mdash;to wit the garret&mdash;Mrs. Hawkins was
      obliged to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang the fellow, I do believe he has gone wilder than ever, but still a
      body can&rsquo;t help liking him if they would&mdash;and what is more, they
      don&rsquo;t ever want to try when they see his eyes and hear him talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within a week or two the Hawkinses were comfortably domiciled in a new log
      house, and were beginning to feel at home. The children were put to
      school; at least it was what passed for a school in those days: a place
      where tender young humanity devoted itself for eight or ten hours a day to
      learning incomprehensible rubbish by heart out of books and reciting it by
      rote, like parrots; so that a finished education consisted simply of a
      permanent headache and the ability to read without stopping to spell the
      words or take breath. Hawkins bought out the village store for a song and
      proceeded to reap the profits, which amounted to but little more than
      another song.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wonderful speculation hinted at by Col. Sellers in his letter turned
      out to be the raising of mules for the Southern market; and really it
      promised very well. The young stock cost but a trifle, the rearing but
      another trifle, and so Hawkins was easily persuaded to embark his slender
      means in the enterprise and turn over the keep and care of the animals to
      Sellers and Uncle Dan&rsquo;l.
    </p>
    <p>
      All went well: Business prospered little by little. Hawkins even built a
      new house, made it two full stories high and put a lightning rod on it.
      People came two or three miles to look at it. But they knew that the rod
      attracted the lightning, and so they gave the place a wide berth in a
      storm, for they were familiar with marksmanship and doubted if the
      lightning could hit that small stick at a distance of a mile and a half
      oftener than once in a hundred and fifty times. Hawkins fitted out his
      house with &ldquo;store&rdquo; furniture from St. Louis, and the fame of its
      magnificence went abroad in the land. Even the parlor carpet was from St.
      Louis&mdash;though the other rooms were clothed in the &ldquo;rag&rdquo; carpeting of
      the country. Hawkins put up the first &ldquo;paling&rdquo; fence that had ever adorned
      the village; and he did not stop there, but whitewashed it. His oil-cloth
      window-curtains had noble pictures on them of castles such as had never
      been seen anywhere in the world but on window-curtains. Hawkins enjoyed
      the admiration these prodigies compelled, but he always smiled to think
      how poor and cheap they were, compared to what the Hawkins mansion would
      display in a future day after the Tennessee Land should have borne its
      minted fruit. Even Washington observed, once, that when the Tennessee Land
      was sold he would have a &ldquo;store&rdquo; carpet in his and Clay&rsquo;s room like the
      one in the parlor. This pleased Hawkins, but it troubled his wife. It did
      not seem wise, to her, to put one&rsquo;s entire earthly trust in the Tennessee
      Land and never think of doing any work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins took a weekly Philadelphia newspaper and a semi-weekly St. Louis
      journal&mdash;almost the only papers that came to the village, though
      Godey&rsquo;s Lady&rsquo;s Book found a good market there and was regarded as the
      perfection of polite literature by some of the ablest critics in the
      place. Perhaps it is only fair to explain that we are writing of a by gone
      age&mdash;some twenty or thirty years ago. In the two newspapers referred
      to lay the secret of Hawkins&rsquo;s growing prosperity. They kept him informed
      of the condition of the crops south and east, and thus he knew which
      articles were likely to be in demand and which articles were likely to be
      unsalable, weeks and even months in advance of the simple folk about him.
      As the months went by he came to be regarded as a wonderfully lucky man.
      It did not occur to the citizens that brains were at the bottom of his
      luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      His title of &ldquo;Squire&rdquo; came into vogue again, but only for a season; for,
      as his wealth and popularity augmented, that title, by imperceptible
      stages, grew up into &ldquo;Judge;&rdquo; indeed it bade fair to swell into &ldquo;General&rdquo;
       bye and bye. All strangers of consequence who visited the village
      gravitated to the Hawkins Mansion and became guests of the &ldquo;Judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins had learned to like the people of his section very much. They were
      uncouth and not cultivated, and not particularly industrious; but they
      were honest and straightforward, and their virtuous ways commanded
      respect. Their patriotism was strong, their pride in the flag was of the
      old fashioned pattern, their love of country amounted to idolatry. Whoever
      dragged the national honor in the dirt won their deathless hatred. They
      still cursed Benedict Arnold as if he were a personal friend who had
      broken faith&mdash;but a week gone by.

      Judge Hawkins and Col. Sellers have made and lost two or three moderate
      fortunes in the meantime and are now pinched by poverty. Sellers has two
      pairs of twins and four extras. In Hawkins&rsquo;s family are six children of
      his own and two adopted ones. From time to time, as fortune smiled, the
      elder children got the benefit of it, spending the lucky seasons at
      excellent schools in St. Louis and the unlucky ones at home in the chafing
      discomfort of straightened circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the Hawkins children nor the world that knew them ever supposed
      that one of the girls was of alien blood and parentage: Such difference as
      existed between Laura and Emily is not uncommon in a family. The girls had
      grown up as sisters, and they were both too young at the time of the
      fearful accident on the Mississippi to know that it was that which had
      thrown their lives together.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet any one who had known the secret of Laura&rsquo;s birth and had seen her
      during these passing years, say at the happy age of twelve or thirteen,
      would have fancied that he knew the reason why she was more winsome than
      her school companion.

      Philosophers dispute whether it is the promise of what she will be in the
      careless school-girl, that makes her attractive, the undeveloped
      maidenhood, or the mere natural, careless sweetness of childhood. If Laura
      at twelve was beginning to be a beauty, the thought of it had never
      entered her head. No, indeed. Her mind was filled with more important
      thoughts. To her simple school-girl dress she was beginning to add those
      mysterious little adornments of ribbon-knots and ear-rings, which were the
      subject of earnest consultations with her grown friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she tripped down the street on a summer&rsquo;s day with her dainty hands
      propped into the ribbon-broidered pockets of her apron, and elbows
      consequently more or less akimbo with her wide Leghorn hat flapping down
      and hiding her face one moment and blowing straight up against her fore
      head the next and making its revealment of fresh young beauty; with all
      her pretty girlish airs and graces in full play, and that sweet ignorance
      of care and that atmosphere of innocence and purity all about her that
      belong to her gracious time of life, indeed she was a vision to warm the
      coldest heart and bless and cheer the saddest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willful, generous, forgiving, imperious, affectionate, improvident,
      bewitching, in short&mdash;was Laura at this period. Could she have
      remained there, this history would not need to be written. But Laura had
      grown to be almost a woman in these few years, to the end of which we have
      now come&mdash;years which had seen Judge Hawkins pass through so many
      trials.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the judge&rsquo;s first bankruptcy came upon him, a homely human angel
      intruded upon him with an offer of $1,500 for the Tennessee Land. Mrs.
      Hawkins said take it. It was a grievous temptation, but the judge
      withstood it. He said the land was for the children&mdash;he could not rob
      them of their future millions for so paltry a sum. When the second blight
      fell upon him, another angel appeared and offered $3,000 for the land. He
      was in such deep distress that he allowed his wife to persuade him to let
      the papers be drawn; but when his children came into his presence in their
      poor apparel, he felt like a traitor and refused to sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he was down again, and deeper in the mire than ever. He paced the
      floor all day, he scarcely slept at night. He blushed even to acknowledge
      it to himself, but treason was in his mind&mdash;he was meditating, at
      last, the sale of the land. Mrs. Hawkins stepped into the room. He had not
      spoken a word, but he felt as guilty as if she had caught him in some
      shameful act. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Si, I do not know what we are going to do. The children are not fit to be
      seen, their clothes are in such a state. But there&rsquo;s something more
      serious still.&mdash;There is scarcely a bite in the house to eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Nancy, go to Johnson&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnson indeed! You took that man&rsquo;s part when he hadn&rsquo;t a friend in the
      world, and you built him up and made him rich. And here&rsquo;s the result of
      it: He lives in our fine house, and we live in his miserable log cabin. He
      has hinted to our children that he would rather they wouldn&rsquo;t come about
      his yard to play with his children,&mdash;which I can bear, and bear easy
      enough, for they&rsquo;re not a sort we want to associate with much&mdash;but
      what I can&rsquo;t bear with any quietness at all, is his telling Franky our
      bill was running pretty high this morning when I sent him for some meal&mdash;and
      that was all he said, too&mdash;didn&rsquo;t give him the meal&mdash;turned off
      and went to talking with the Hargrave girls about some stuff they wanted
      to cheapen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy, this is astounding!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it is, I warrant you. I&rsquo;ve kept still, Si, as long as ever I
      could. Things have been getting worse and worse, and worse and worse,
      every single day; I don&rsquo;t go out of the house, I feel so down; but you had
      trouble enough, and I wouldn&rsquo;t say a word&mdash;and I wouldn&rsquo;t say a word
      now, only things have got so bad that I don&rsquo;t know what to do, nor where
      to turn.&rdquo; And she gave way and put her face in her hands and cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor child, don&rsquo;t grieve so. I never thought that of Johnson. I am clear
      at my wit&rsquo;s end. I don&rsquo;t know what in the world to do. Now if somebody
      would come along and offer $3,000&mdash;Uh, if somebody only would come
      along and offer $3,000 for that Tennessee Land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d sell it, Si!&rdquo; said Mrs. Hawkins excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p065" id="p065"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p065.jpg (27K)" src="images/p065.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hawkins was out of the room in a moment. Within a minute she was back
      again with a business-looking stranger, whom she seated, and then she took
      her leave again. Hawkins said to himself, &ldquo;How can a man ever lose faith?
      When the blackest hour comes, Providence always comes with it&mdash;ah,
      this is the very timeliest help that ever poor harried devil had; if this
      blessed man offers but a thousand I&rsquo;ll embrace him like a brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stranger said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am aware that you own 75,000 acres, of land in East Tennessee, and
      without sacrificing your time, I will come to the point at once. I am
      agent of an iron manufacturing company, and they empower me to offer you
      ten thousand dollars for that land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins&rsquo;s heart bounded within him. His whole frame was racked and
      wrenched with fettered hurrahs. His first impulse was to shout &ldquo;Done! and
      God bless the iron company, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But a something flitted through his mind, and his opened lips uttered
      nothing. The enthusiasm faded away from his eyes, and the look of a man
      who is thinking took its place. Presently, in a hesitating, undecided way,
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;it don&rsquo;t seem quite enough. That&mdash;that is a very
      valuable property&mdash;very valuable. It&rsquo;s brim full of iron-ore, sir&mdash;brim
      full of it! And copper, coal,&mdash;everything&mdash;everything you can
      think of! Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll reserve everything except
      the iron, and I&rsquo;ll sell them the iron property for $15,000 cash, I to go
      in with them and own an undivided interest of one-half the concern&mdash;or
      the stock, as you may say. I&rsquo;m out of business, and I&rsquo;d just as soon help
      run the thing as not. Now how does that strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am only an agent of these people, who are friends of mine, and I
      am not even paid for my services. To tell you the truth, I have tried to
      persuade them not to go into the thing; and I have come square out with
      their offer, without throwing out any feelers&mdash;and I did it in the
      hope that you would refuse. A man pretty much always refuses another man&rsquo;s
      first offer, no matter what it is. But I have performed my duty, and will
      take pleasure in telling them what you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was about to rise. Hawkins said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hawkins thought again. And the substance of his thought was: &ldquo;This is a
      deep man; this is a very deep man; I don&rsquo;t like his candor; your
      ostentatiously candid business man&rsquo;s a deep fox&mdash;always a deep fox;
      this man&rsquo;s that iron company himself&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he is; he wants
      that property, too; I am not so blind but I can see that; he don&rsquo;t want
      the company to go into this thing&mdash;O, that&rsquo;s very good; yes, that&rsquo;s
      very good indeed&mdash;stuff! he&rsquo;ll be back here tomorrow, sure, and take
      my offer; take it? I&rsquo;ll risk anything he is suffering to take it now; here&mdash;I
      must mind what I&rsquo;m about. What has started this sudden excitement about
      iron? I wonder what is in the wind? just as sure as I&rsquo;m alive this moment,
      there&rsquo;s something tremendous stirring in iron speculation&rdquo; [here Hawkins
      got up and began to pace the floor with excited eyes and with gesturing
      hands]&mdash;&ldquo;something enormous going on in iron, without the shadow of a
      doubt, and here I sit mousing in the dark and never knowing anything about
      it; great heaven, what an escape I&rsquo;ve made! this underhanded mercenary
      creature might have taken me up&mdash;and ruined me! but I have escaped,
      and I warrant me I&rsquo;ll not put my foot into&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and turned toward the stranger; saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have made you a proposition, you have not accepted it, and I desire
      that you will consider that I have made none. At the same time my
      conscience will not allow me to&mdash;. Please alter the figures I named
      to thirty thousand dollars, if you will, and let the proposition go to the
      company&mdash;I will stick to it if it breaks my heart!&rdquo; The stranger
      looked amused, and there was a pretty well defined touch of surprise in
      his expression, too, but Hawkins never noticed it. Indeed he scarcely
      noticed anything or knew what he was about. The man left; Hawkins flung
      himself into a chair; thought a few moments, then glanced around, looked
      frightened, sprang to the door&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late&mdash;too late! He&rsquo;s gone! Fool that I am! always a fool! Thirty
      thousand&mdash;ass that I am! Oh, why didn&rsquo;t I say fifty thousand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p068" id="p068"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p068.jpg (22K)" src="images/p068.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He plunged his hands into his hair and leaned his elbows on his knees, and
      fell to rocking himself back and forth in anguish. Mrs. Hawkins sprang in,
      beaming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Si?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, con-found the con-founded&mdash;con-found it, Nancy. I&rsquo;ve gone and
      done it, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done what Si for mercy&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Done everything! Ruined everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, tell me, tell me! Don&rsquo;t keep a body in such suspense. Didn&rsquo;t he
      buy, after all? Didn&rsquo;t he make an offer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Offer? He offered $10,000 for our land, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the good providence from the very bottom of my heart of hearts!
      What sort of ruin do you call that, Si!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy, do you suppose I listened to such a preposterous proposition? No!
      Thank fortune I&rsquo;m not a simpleton! I saw through the pretty scheme in a
      second. It&rsquo;s a vast iron speculation!&mdash;millions upon millions in it!
      But fool as I am I told him he could have half the iron property for
      thirty thousand&mdash;and if I only had him back here he couldn&rsquo;t touch it
      for a cent less than a quarter of a million!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hawkins looked up white and despairing:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You threw away this chance, you let this man go, and we in this awful
      trouble? You don&rsquo;t mean it, you can&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Throw it away? Catch me at it! Why woman, do you suppose that man don&rsquo;t
      know what he is about? Bless you, he&rsquo;ll be back fast enough to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never, never. He never will comeback. I don&rsquo;t know what is to
      become of us. I don&rsquo;t know what in the world is to become of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shade of uneasiness came into Hawkins&rsquo;s face. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Nancy, you&mdash;you can&rsquo;t believe what you are saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe it, indeed? I know it, Si. And I know that we haven&rsquo;t a cent in
      the world, and we&rsquo;ve sent ten thousand dollars a-begging.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nancy, you frighten me. Now could that man&mdash;is it possible that I&mdash;hanged
      if I don&rsquo;t believe I have missed a chance! Don&rsquo;t grieve, Nancy, don&rsquo;t
      grieve. I&rsquo;ll go right after him. I&rsquo;ll take&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take&mdash;what a
      fool I am!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take anything he&rsquo;ll give!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next instant he left the house on a run. But the man was no longer in
      the town. Nobody knew where he belonged or whither he had gone. Hawkins
      came slowly back, watching wistfully but hopelessly for the stranger, and
      lowering his price steadily with his sinking heart. And when his foot
      finally pressed his own threshold, the value he held the entire Tennessee
      property at was five hundred dollars&mdash;two hundred down and the rest
      in three equal annual payments, without interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sad gathering at the Hawkins fireside the next night. All the
      children were present but Clay. Mr. Hawkins said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washington, we seem to be hopelessly fallen, hopelessly involved. I am
      ready to give up. I do not know where to turn&mdash;I never have been down
      so low before, I never have seen things so dismal. There are many mouths
      to feed; Clay is at work; we must lose you, also, for a little while, my
      boy. But it will not be long&mdash;the Tennessee land&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, and was conscious of a blush. There was silence for a moment,
      and then Washington&mdash;now a lank, dreamy-eyed stripling between
      twenty-two and twenty-three years of age&mdash;said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Col. Sellers would come for me, I would go and stay with him a while,
      till the Tennessee land is sold. He has often wanted me to come, ever
      since he moved to Hawkeye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he can&rsquo;t well come for you, Washington. From what I can hear&mdash;not
      from him of course, but from others&mdash;he is not far from as bad off as
      we are&mdash;and his family is as large, too. He might find something for
      you to do, maybe, but you&rsquo;d better try to get to him yourself, Washington&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      only thirty miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can I, father? There&rsquo;s no stage or anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if there were, stages require money. A stage goes from Swansea, five
      miles from here. But it would be cheaper to walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, they must know you there, and no doubt they would credit you in a
      moment, for a little stage ride like that. Couldn&rsquo;t you write and ask
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you, Washington&mdash;seeing it&rsquo;s you that wants the ride? And
      what do you think you&rsquo;ll do, Washington, when you get to Hawkeye? Finish
      your invention for making window-glass opaque?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I have given that up. I almost knew I could do it, but it was so
      tedious and troublesome I quit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid of it, my boy. Then I suppose you&rsquo;ll finish your plan of
      coloring hen&rsquo;s eggs by feeding a peculiar diet to the hen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I believe I have found out the stuff that will do it, but it
      kills the hen; so I have dropped that for the present, though I can take
      it up again some day when I learn how to manage the mixture better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what have you got on hand&mdash;anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, three or four things. I think they are all good and can all be
      done, but they are tiresome, and besides they require money. But as soon
      as the land is sold&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Emily, were you about to say something?&rdquo; said Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. If you are willing, I will go to St. Louis. That will make
      another mouth less to feed. Mrs. Buckner has always wanted me to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the money, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I think she would send it, if you would write her&mdash;and I know
      she would wait for her pay till&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Laura, let&rsquo;s hear from you, my girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p072" id="p072"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p072.jpg (48K)" src="images/p072.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Emily and Laura were about the same age&mdash;between seventeen and
      eighteen. Emily was fair and pretty, girlish and diffident&mdash;blue eyes
      and light hair. Laura had a proud bearing, and a somewhat mature look; she
      had fine, clean-cut features, her complexion was pure white and contrasted
      vividly with her black hair and eyes; she was not what one calls pretty&mdash;she
      was beautiful. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go to St. Louis, too, sir. I will find a way to get there. I will
      make a way. And I will find a way to help myself along, and do what I can
      to help the rest, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke it like a princess. Mrs. Hawkins smiled proudly and kissed her,
      saying in a tone of fond reproof:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So one of my girls is going to turn out and work for her living! It&rsquo;s
      like your pluck and spirit, child, but we will hope that we haven&rsquo;t got
      quite down to that, yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s eyes beamed affection under her mother&rsquo;s caress. Then she
      straightened up, folded her white hands in her lap and became a splendid
      ice-berg. Clay&rsquo;s dog put up his brown nose for a little attention, and got
      it. He retired under the table with an apologetic yelp, which did not
      affect the iceberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Hawkins had written and asked Clay to return home and consult with
      him upon family affairs. He arrived the evening after this conversation,
      and the whole household gave him a rapturous welcome. He brought sadly
      needed help with him, consisting of the savings of a year and a half of
      work&mdash;nearly two hundred dollars in money.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a ray of sunshine which (to this easy household) was the earnest of
      a clearing sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bright and early in the morning the family were astir, and all were busy
      preparing Washington for his journey&mdash;at least all but Washington
      himself, who sat apart, steeped in a reverie. When the time for his
      departure came, it was easy to see how fondly all loved him and how hard
      it was to let him go, notwithstanding they had often seen him go before,
      in his St. Louis schooling days. In the most matter-of-course way they had
      borne the burden of getting him ready for his trip, never seeming to think
      of his helping in the matter; in the same matter-of-course way Clay had
      hired a horse and cart; and now that the good-byes were ended he bundled
      Washington&rsquo;s baggage in and drove away with the exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Swansea Clay paid his stage fare, stowed him away in the vehicle, and
      saw him off. Then he returned home and reported progress, like a committee
      of the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clay remained at home several days. He held many consultations with his
      mother upon the financial condition of the family, and talked once with
      his father upon the same subject, but only once. He found a change in that
      quarter which was distressing; years of fluctuating fortune had done their
      work; each reverse had weakened the father&rsquo;s spirit and impaired his
      energies; his last misfortune seemed to have left hope and ambition dead
      within him; he had no projects, formed no plans&mdash;evidently he was a
      vanquished man. He looked worn and tired. He inquired into Clay&rsquo;s affairs
      and prospects, and when he found that Clay was doing pretty well and was
      likely to do still better, it was plain that he resigned himself with easy
      facility to look to the son for a support; and he said, &ldquo;Keep yourself
      informed of poor Washington&rsquo;s condition and movements, and help him along
      all you can, Clay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The younger children, also, seemed relieved of all fears and distresses,
      and very ready and willing to look to Clay for a livelihood. Within three
      days a general tranquility and satisfaction reigned in the household.
      Clay&rsquo;s hundred and eighty or ninety, dollars had worked a wonder. The
      family were as contented, now, and as free from care as they could have
      been with a fortune. It was well that Mrs. Hawkins held the purse
      otherwise the treasure would have lasted but a very little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took but a trifle to pay Hawkins&rsquo;s outstanding obligations, for he had
      always had a horror of debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Clay bade his home good-bye and set out to return to the field of his
      labors, he was conscious that henceforth he was to have his father&rsquo;s
      family on his hands as pensioners; but he did not allow himself to chafe
      at the thought, for he reasoned that his father had dealt by him with a
      free hand and a loving one all his life, and now that hard fortune had
      broken his spirit it ought to be a pleasure, not a pain, to work for him.
      The younger children were born and educated dependents. They had never
      been taught to do anything for themselves, and it did not seem to occur to
      them to make an attempt now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls would not have been permitted to work for a living under any
      circumstances whatever. It was a southern family, and of good blood; and
      for any person except Laura, either within or without the household to
      have suggested such an idea would have brought upon the suggester the
      suspicion of being a lunatic.

    <p>
      Bearing Washington Hawkins and his fortunes, the stage-coach tore out of
      Swansea at a fearful gait, with horn tooting gaily and half the town
      admiring from doors and windows. But it did not tear any more after it got
      to the outskirts; it dragged along stupidly enough, then&mdash;till it
      came in sight of the next hamlet; and then the bugle tooted gaily again
      and again the vehicle went tearing by the horses. This sort of conduct
      marked every entry to a station and every exit from it; and so in those
      days children grew up with the idea that stage-coaches always tore and
      always tooted; but they also grew up with the idea that pirates went into
      action in their Sunday clothes, carrying the black flag in one hand and
      pistolling people with the other, merely because they were so represented
      in the pictures&mdash;but these illusions vanished when later years
      brought their disenchanting wisdom. They learned then that the stagecoach
      is but a poor, plodding, vulgar thing in the solitudes of the highway; and
      that the pirate is only a seedy, unfantastic &ldquo;rough,&rdquo; when he is out of
      the pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward evening, the stage-coach came thundering into Hawkeye with a
      perfectly triumphant ostentation&mdash;which was natural and proper, for
      Hawkey a was a pretty large town for interior Missouri. Washington, very
      stiff and tired and hungry, climbed out, and wondered how he was to
      proceed now. But his difficulty was quickly solved. Col. Sellers came down
      the street on a run and arrived panting for breath. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless you&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad to see you, Washington&mdash;perfectly
      delighted to see you, my boy! I got your message. Been on the look-out for
      you. Heard the stage horn, but had a party I couldn&rsquo;t shake off&mdash;man
      that&rsquo;s got an enormous thing on hand&mdash;wants me to put some capital
      into it&mdash;and I tell you, my boy, I could do worse, I could do a deal
      worse. No, now, let that luggage alone; I&rsquo;ll fix that. Here, Jerry, got
      anything to do? All right-shoulder this plunder and follow me. Come along,
      Washington. Lord I&rsquo;m glad to see you! Wife and the children are just
      perishing to look at you. Bless you, they won&rsquo;t know you, you&rsquo;ve grown so.
      Folks all well, I suppose? That&rsquo;s good&mdash;glad to hear that. We&rsquo;re
      always going to run down and see them, but I&rsquo;m into so many operations,
      and they&rsquo;re not things a man feels like trusting to other people, and so
      somehow we keep putting it off. Fortunes in them! Good gracious, it&rsquo;s the
      country to pile up wealth in! Here we are&mdash;here&rsquo;s where the Sellers
      dynasty hangs out. Hump it on the door-step, Jerry&mdash;the blackest
      niggro in the State, Washington, but got a good heart&mdash;mighty likely
      boy, is Jerry. And now I suppose you&rsquo;ve got to have ten cents, Jerry.
      That&rsquo;s all right&mdash;when a man works for me&mdash;when a man&mdash;in
      the other pocket, I reckon&mdash;when a man&mdash;why, where the mischief
      as that portmonnaie!&mdash;when a&mdash;well now that&rsquo;s odd&mdash;Oh, now
      I remember, must have left it at the bank; and b&rsquo;George I&rsquo;ve left my
      check-book, too&mdash;Polly says I ought to have a nurse&mdash;well, no
      matter. Let me have a dime, Washington, if you&rsquo;ve got&mdash;ah, thanks.
      Now clear out, Jerry, your complexion has brought on the twilight half an
      hour ahead of time. Pretty fair joke&mdash;pretty fair. Here he is, Polly!
      Washington&rsquo;s come, children! come now, don&rsquo;t eat him up&mdash;finish him
      in the house. Welcome, my boy, to a mansion that is proud to shelter the
      son of the best man that walks on the ground. Si Hawkins has been a good
      friend to me, and I believe I can say that whenever I&rsquo;ve had a chance to
      put him into a good thing I&rsquo;ve done it, and done it pretty cheerfully,
      too. I put him into that sugar speculation&mdash;what a grand thing that
      was, if we hadn&rsquo;t held on too long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p077" id="p077"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p077.jpg (37K)" src="images/p077.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      True enough; but holding on too long had utterly ruined both of them; and
      the saddest part of it was, that they never had had so much money to lose
      before, for Sellers&rsquo;s sale of their mule crop that year in New Orleans had
      been a great financial success. If he had kept out of sugar and gone back
      home content to stick to mules it would have been a happy wisdom. As it
      was, he managed to kill two birds with one stone&mdash;that is to say, he
      killed the sugar speculation by holding for high rates till he had to sell
      at the bottom figure, and that calamity killed the mule that laid the
      golden egg&mdash;which is but a figurative expression and will be so
      understood. Sellers had returned home cheerful but empty-handed, and the
      mule business lapsed into other hands. The sale of the Hawkins property by
      the Sheriff had followed, and the Hawkins hearts been torn to see Uncle
      Dan&rsquo;l and his wife pass from the auction-block into the hands of a negro
      trader and depart for the remote South to be seen no more by the family.
      It had seemed like seeing their own flesh and blood sold into banishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington was greatly pleased with the Sellers mansion. It was a
      two-story-and-a-half brick, and much more stylish than any of its
      neighbors. He was borne to the family sitting room in triumph by the swarm
      of little Sellerses, the parents following with their arms about each
      other&rsquo;s waists.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole family were poorly and cheaply dressed; and the clothing,
      although neat and clean, showed many evidences of having seen long
      service. The Colonel&rsquo;s &ldquo;stovepipe&rdquo; hat was napless and shiny with much
      polishing, but nevertheless it had an almost convincing expression about
      it of having been just purchased new. The rest of his clothing was napless
      and shiny, too, but it had the air of being entirely satisfied with itself
      and blandly sorry for other people&rsquo;s clothes. It was growing rather dark
      in the house, and the evening air was chilly, too. Sellers said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay off your overcoat, Washington, and draw up to the stove and make
      yourself at home&mdash;just consider yourself under your own shingles my
      boy&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have a fire going, in a jiffy. Light the lamp, Polly, dear,
      and let&rsquo;s have things cheerful&mdash;just as glad to see you, Washington,
      as if you&rsquo;d been lost a century and we&rsquo;d found you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the Colonel was conveying a lighted match into a poor little
      stove. Then he propped the stove door to its place by leaning the poker
      against it, for the hinges had retired from business. This door framed a
      small square of isinglass, which now warmed up with a faint glow. Mrs.
      Sellers lit a cheap, showy lamp, which dissipated a good deal of the
      gloom, and then everybody gathered into the light and took the stove into
      close companionship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children climbed all over Sellers, fondled him, petted him, and were
      lavishly petted in return. Out from this tugging, laughing, chattering
      disguise of legs and arms and little faces, the Colonel&rsquo;s voice worked its
      way and his tireless tongue ran blithely on without interruption; and the
      purring little wife, diligent with her knitting, sat near at hand and
      looked happy and proud and grateful; and she listened as one who listens
      to oracles and, gospels and whose grateful soul is being refreshed with
      the bread of life. Bye and bye the children quieted down to listen;
      clustered about their father, and resting their elbows on his legs, they
      hung upon his words as if he were uttering the music of the spheres.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dreary old hair-cloth sofa against the wall; a few damaged chairs; the
      small table the lamp stood on; the crippled stove&mdash;these things
      constituted the furniture of the room. There was no carpet on the floor;
      on the wall were occasional square-shaped interruptions of the general
      tint of the plaster which betrayed that there used to be pictures in the
      house&mdash;but there were none now. There were no mantel ornaments,
      unless one might bring himself to regard as an ornament a clock which
      never came within fifteen strokes of striking the right time, and whose
      hands always hitched together at twenty-two minutes past anything and
      traveled in company the rest of the way home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remarkable clock!&rdquo; said Sellers, and got up and wound it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
      offered&mdash;well, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect you to believe what I&rsquo;ve been
      offered for that clock. Old Gov. Hager never sees me but he says, &lsquo;Come,
      now, Colonel, name your price&mdash;I must have that clock!&rsquo; But my
      goodness I&rsquo;d as soon think of selling my wife. As I was saying to&mdash;silence
      in the court, now, she&rsquo;s begun to strike! You can&rsquo;t talk against her&mdash;you
      have to just be patient and hold up till she&rsquo;s said her say. Ah well, as I
      was saying, when&mdash;she&rsquo;s beginning again! Nineteen, twenty,
      twenty-one, twenty-two, twen&mdash;&mdash;ah, that&rsquo;s all.&mdash;Yes, as I
      was saying to old Judge&mdash;&mdash;go it, old girl, don&rsquo;t mind me.&mdash;Now
      how is that?&mdash;&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that a good, spirited tone? She can wake
      the dead! Sleep? Why you might as well try to sleep in a thunder-factory.
      Now just listen at that. She&rsquo;ll strike a hundred and fifty, now, without
      stopping,&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see. There ain&rsquo;t another clock like that in
      Christendom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington hoped that this might be true, for the din was distracting&mdash;though
      the family, one and all, seemed filled with joy; and the more the clock
      &ldquo;buckled down to her work&rdquo; as the Colonel expressed it, and the more
      insupportable the clatter became, the more enchanted they all appeared to
      be. When there was silence, Mrs Sellers lifted upon Washington a face that
      beamed with a childlike pride, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It belonged to his grandmother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The look and the tone were a plain call for admiring surprise, and
      therefore Washington said (it was the only thing that offered itself at
      the moment:)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it did, didn&rsquo;t it father!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the twins. &ldquo;She was my
      great-grandmother&mdash;and George&rsquo;s too; wasn&rsquo;t she, father! You never
      saw her, but Sis has seen her, when Sis was a baby-didn&rsquo;t you, Sis! Sis
      has seen her most a hundred times. She was awful deef&mdash;she&rsquo;s dead
      now. Ain&rsquo;t she, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the children chimed in, now, with one general Babel of information
      about deceased&mdash;nobody offering to read the riot act or seeming to
      discountenance the insurrection or disapprove of it in any way&mdash;but
      the head twin drowned all the turmoil and held his own against the field:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our clock, now&mdash;and it&rsquo;s got wheels inside of it, and a thing
      that flutters every time she strikes&mdash;don&rsquo;t it, father!
      Great-grandmother died before hardly any of us was born&mdash;she was an
      Old-School Baptist and had warts all over her&mdash;you ask father if she
      didn&rsquo;t. She had an uncle once that was bald-headed and used to have fits;
      he wasn&rsquo;t our uncle, I don&rsquo;t know what he was to us&mdash;some kin or
      another I reckon&mdash;father&rsquo;s seen him a thousand times&mdash;hain&rsquo;t
      you, father! We used to have a calf that et apples and just chawed up
      dishrags like nothing, and if you stay here you&rsquo;ll see lots of funerals&mdash;won&rsquo;t
      he, Sis! Did you ever see a house afire? I have! Once me and Jim Terry&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Sellers began to speak now, and the storm ceased. He began to tell
      about an enormous speculation he was thinking of embarking some capital in&mdash;a
      speculation which some London bankers had been over to consult with him
      about&mdash;and soon he was building glittering pyramids of coin, and
      Washington was presently growing opulent under the magic of his eloquence.
      But at the same time Washington was not able to ignore the cold entirely.<br />

      He was nearly as close to the stove as he could get, and yet he could not
      persuade himself that he felt the slightest heat, notwithstanding the
      isinglass&rsquo; door was still gently and serenely glowing. He tried to get a
      trifle closer to the stove, and the consequence was, he tripped the
      supporting poker and the stove-door tumbled to the floor. And then there
      was a revelation&mdash;there was nothing in the stove but a lighted
      tallow-candle! The poor youth blushed and felt as if he must die with
      shame. But the Colonel was only disconcerted for a moment&mdash;he
      straightway found his voice again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little idea of my own, Washington&mdash;one of the greatest things in
      the world! You must write and tell your father about it&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget
      that, now. I have been reading up some European Scientific reports&mdash;friend
      of mine, Count Fugier, sent them to me&mdash;sends me all sorts of things
      from Paris&mdash;he thinks the world of me, Fugier does. Well, I saw that
      the Academy of France had been testing the properties of heat, and they
      came to the conclusion that it was a nonconductor or something like that,
      and of course its influence must necessarily be deadly in nervous
      organizations with excitable temperaments, especially where there is any
      tendency toward rheumatic affections. Bless you I saw in a moment what was
      the matter with us, and says I, out goes your fires!&mdash;no more slow
      torture and certain death for me, sir. What you want is the appearance of
      heat, not the heat itself&mdash;that&rsquo;s the idea. Well how to do it was the
      next thing. I just put my head to work, pegged away a couple of days, and
      here you are! Rheumatism? Why a man can&rsquo;t any more start a case of
      rheumatism in this house than he can shake an opinion out of a mummy!
      Stove with a candle in it and a transparent door&mdash;that&rsquo;s it&mdash;it
      has been the salvation of this family. Don&rsquo;t you fail to write your father
      about it, Washington. And tell him the idea is mine&mdash;I&rsquo;m no more
      conceited than most people, I reckon, but you know it is human nature for
      a man to want credit for a thing like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington said with his blue lips that he would, but he said in his
      secret heart that he would promote no such iniquity. He tried to believe
      in the healthfulness of the invention, and succeeded tolerably well; but
      after all he could not feel that good health in a frozen body was any real
      improvement on the rheumatism.

      The supper at Col. Sellers&rsquo;s was not sumptuous, in the beginning, but it
      improved on acquaintance. That is to say, that what Washington regarded at
      first sight as mere lowly potatoes, presently became awe-inspiring
      agricultural productions that had been reared in some ducal garden beyond
      the sea, under the sacred eye of the duke himself, who had sent them to
      Sellers; the bread was from corn which could be grown in only one favored
      locality in the earth and only a favored few could get it; the Rio coffee,
      which at first seemed execrable to the taste, took to itself an improved
      flavor when Washington was told to drink it slowly and not hurry what
      should be a lingering luxury in order to be fully appreciated&mdash;it was
      from the private stores of a Brazilian nobleman with an unrememberable
      name. The Colonel&rsquo;s tongue was a magician&rsquo;s wand that turned dried apples
      into figs and water into wine as easily as it could change a hovel into a
      palace and present poverty into imminent future riches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington slept in a cold bed in a carpetless room and woke up in a
      palace in the morning; at least the palace lingered during the moment that
      he was rubbing his eyes and getting his bearings&mdash;and then it
      disappeared and he recognized that the Colonel&rsquo;s inspiring talk had been
      influencing his dreams. Fatigue had made him sleep late; when he entered
      the sitting room he noticed that the old hair-cloth sofa was absent; when
      he sat down to breakfast the Colonel tossed six or seven dollars in bills
      on the table, counted them over, said he was a little short and must call
      upon his banker; then returned the bills to his wallet with the
      indifferent air of a man who is used to money. The breakfast was not an
      improvement upon the supper, but the Colonel talked it up and transformed
      it into an oriental feast. Bye and bye, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I intend to look out for you, Washington, my boy. I hunted up a place for
      you yesterday, but I am not referring to that,&mdash;now&mdash;that is a
      mere livelihood&mdash;mere bread and butter; but when I say I mean to look
      out for you I mean something very different. I mean to put things in your
      way than will make a mere livelihood a trifling thing. I&rsquo;ll put you in a
      way to make more money that you&rsquo;ll ever know what to do with. You&rsquo;ll be
      right here where I can put my hand on you when anything turns up. I&rsquo;ve got
      some prodigious operations on foot; but I&rsquo;m keeping quiet; mum&rsquo;s the word;
      your old hand don&rsquo;t go around pow-wowing and letting everybody see his
      k&rsquo;yards and find out his little game. But all in good time, Washington,
      all in good time. You&rsquo;ll see. Now there&rsquo;s an operation in corn that looks
      well. Some New York men are trying to get me to go into it&mdash;buy up
      all the growing crops and just boss the market when they mature&mdash;ah,
      I tell you it&rsquo;s a great thing. And it only costs a trifle; two millions or
      two and a half will do it. I haven&rsquo;t exactly promised yet&mdash;there&rsquo;s no
      hurry&mdash;the more indifferent I seem, you know, the more anxious those
      fellows will get. And then there is the hog speculation&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      bigger still. We&rsquo;ve got quiet men at work,&rdquo; [he was very impressive here,]
      &ldquo;mousing around, to get propositions out of all the farmers in the whole
      west and northwest for the hog crop, and other agents quietly getting
      propositions and terms out of all the manufactories&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you
      see, if we can get all the hogs and all the slaughter houses into our
      hands on the dead quiet&mdash;whew! it would take three ships to carry the
      money.&mdash;I&rsquo;ve looked into the thing&mdash;calculated all the chances
      for and all the chances against, and though I shake my head and hesitate
      and keep on thinking, apparently, I&rsquo;ve got my mind made up that if the
      thing can be done on a capital of six millions, that&rsquo;s the horse to put up
      money on! Why Washington&mdash;but what&rsquo;s the use of talking about it&mdash;any
      man can see that there&rsquo;s whole Atlantic oceans of cash in it, gulfs and
      bays thrown in. But there&rsquo;s a bigger thing than that, yes bigger&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Colonel, you can&rsquo;t want anything bigger!&rdquo; said Washington, his eyes
      blazing. &ldquo;Oh, I wish I could go into either of those speculations&mdash;I
      only wish I had money&mdash;I wish I wasn&rsquo;t cramped and kept down and
      fettered with poverty, and such prodigious chances lying right here in
      sight! Oh, it is a fearful thing to be poor. But don&rsquo;t throw away those
      things&mdash;they are so splendid and I can see how sure they are. Don&rsquo;t
      throw them away for something still better and maybe fail in it! I
      wouldn&rsquo;t, Colonel. I would stick to these. I wish father were here and
      were his old self again&mdash;Oh, he never in his life had such chances as
      these are. Colonel; you can&rsquo;t improve on these&mdash;no man can improve on
      them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sweet, compassionate smile played about the Colonel&rsquo;s features, and he
      leaned over the table with the air of a man who is &ldquo;going to show you&rdquo; and
      do it without the least trouble:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Washington, my boy, these things are nothing. They look large of
      course&mdash;they look large to a novice, but to a man who has been all
      his life accustomed to large operations&mdash;shaw! They&rsquo;re well enough to
      while away an idle hour with, or furnish a bit of employment that will
      give a trifle of idle capital a chance to earn its bread while it is
      waiting for something to do, but&mdash;now just listen a moment&mdash;just
      let me give you an idea of what we old veterans of commerce call
      &lsquo;business.&rsquo; Here&rsquo;s the Rothschild&rsquo;s proposition&mdash;this is between you
      and me, you understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington nodded three or four times impatiently, and his glowing eyes
      said, &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;hurry&mdash;I understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&mdash;&ldquo;for I wouldn&rsquo;t have it get out for a fortune. They want me
      to go in with them on the sly&mdash;agent was here two weeks ago about it&mdash;go
      in on the sly&rdquo; [voice down to an impressive whisper, now,] &ldquo;and buy up a
      hundred and thirteen wild cat banks in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois
      and Missouri&mdash;notes of these banks are at all sorts of discount now&mdash;average
      discount of the hundred and thirteen is forty-four per cent&mdash;buy them
      all up, you see, and then all of a sudden let the cat out of the bag!
      Whiz! the stock of every one of those wildcats would spin up to a
      tremendous premium before you could turn a handspring&mdash;profit on the
      speculation not a dollar less than forty millions!&rdquo; [An eloquent pause,
      while the marvelous vision settled into W.&lsquo;s focus.] &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your hogs
      now? Why my dear innocent boy, we would just sit down on the front
      door-steps and peddle banks like lucifer matches!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington finally got his breath and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is perfectly wonderful! Why couldn&rsquo;t these things have happened in
      father&rsquo;s day? And I&mdash;it&rsquo;s of no use&mdash;they simply lie before my
      face and mock me. There is nothing for me but to stand helpless and see
      other people reap the astonishing harvest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Washington, don&rsquo;t you worry. I&rsquo;ll fix you. There&rsquo;s plenty of
      chances. How much money have you got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the presence of so many millions, Washington could not keep from
      blushing when he had to confess that he had but eighteen dollars in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, all right&mdash;don&rsquo;t despair. Other people have been obliged to
      begin with less. I have a small idea that may develop into something for
      us both, all in good time. Keep your money close and add to it. I&rsquo;ll make
      it breed. I&rsquo;ve been experimenting (to pass away the time), on a little
      preparation for curing sore eyes&mdash;a kind of decoction nine-tenths
      water and the other tenth drugs that don&rsquo;t cost more than a dollar a
      barrel; I&rsquo;m still experimenting; there&rsquo;s one ingredient wanted yet to
      perfect the thing, and somehow I can&rsquo;t just manage to hit upon the thing
      that&rsquo;s necessary, and I don&rsquo;t dare talk with a chemist, of course. But I&rsquo;m
      progressing, and before many weeks I wager the country will ring with the
      fame of Beriah Sellers&rsquo; Infallible Imperial Oriental Optic Liniment and
      Salvation for Sore Eyes&mdash;the Medical Wonder of the Age! Small bottles
      fifty cents, large ones a dollar. Average cost, five and seven cents for
      the two sizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first year sell, say, ten thousand bottles in Missouri, seven
      thousand in Iowa, three thousand in Arkansas, four thousand in Kentucky,
      six thousand in Illinois, and say twenty-five thousand in the rest of the
      country. Total, fifty five thousand bottles; profit clear of all expenses,
      twenty thousand dollars at the very lowest calculation. All the capital
      needed is to manufacture the first two thousand bottles&mdash;say a
      hundred and fifty dollars&mdash;then the money would begin to flow in. The
      second year, sales would reach 200,000 bottles&mdash;clear profit, say,
      $75,000&mdash;and in the meantime the great factory would be building in
      St. Louis, to cost, say, $100,000. The third year we could easily sell
      1,000,000 bottles in the United States and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, splendid!&rdquo; said Washington. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s commence right away&mdash;let&rsquo;s&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;1,000,000 bottles in the United States&mdash;profit at
      least $350,000&mdash;and then it would begin to be time to turn our
      attention toward the real idea of the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The real idea of it! Ain&rsquo;t $350,000 a year a pretty real&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff! Why what an infant you are, Washington&mdash;what a guileless,
      short-sighted, easily-contented innocent you are, my poor little
      country-bred know-nothing! Would I go to all that trouble and bother for
      the poor crumbs a body might pick up in this country? Now do I look like a
      man who&mdash;&mdash;does my history suggest that I am a man who deals in
      trifles, contents himself with the narrow horizon that hems in the common
      herd, sees no further than the end of his nose? Now you know that that is
      not me&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t be me. You ought to know that if I throw my time and
      abilities into a patent medicine, it&rsquo;s a patent medicine whose field of
      operations is the solid earth! its clients the swarming nations that
      inhabit it! Why what is the republic of America for an eye-water country?
      Lord bless you, it is nothing but a barren highway that you&rsquo;ve got to
      cross to get to the true eye-water market! Why, Washington, in the
      Oriental countries people swarm like the sands of the desert; every square
      mile of ground upholds its thousands upon thousands of struggling human
      creatures&mdash;and every separate and individual devil of them&rsquo;s got the
      ophthalmia! It&rsquo;s as natural to them as noses are&mdash;and sin. It&rsquo;s born
      with them, it stays with them, it&rsquo;s all that some of them have left when
      they die. Three years of introductory trade in the orient and what will be
      the result? Why, our headquarters would be in Constantinople and our
      hindquarters in Further India! Factories and warehouses in Cairo, Ispahan,
      Bagdad, Damascus, Jerusalem, Yedo, Peking, Bangkok, Delhi, Bombay&mdash;and
      Calcutta! Annual income&mdash;well, God only knows how many millions and
      millions apiece!&rdquo;

      Washington was so dazed, so bewildered&mdash;his heart and his eyes had
      wandered so far away among the strange lands beyond the seas, and such
      avalanches of coin and currency had fluttered and jingled confusedly down
      before him, that he was now as one who has been whirling round and round
      for a time, and, stopping all at once, finds his surroundings still
      whirling and all objects a dancing chaos. However, little by little the
      Sellers family cooled down and crystalized into shape, and the poor room
      lost its glitter and resumed its poverty. Then the youth found his voice
      and begged Sellers to drop everything and hurry up the eye-water; and he
      got his eighteen dollars and tried to force it upon the Colonel&mdash;pleaded
      with him to take it&mdash;implored him to do it. But the Colonel would
      not; said he would not need the capital (in his native magnificent way he
      called that eighteen dollars Capital) till the eye-water was an
      accomplished fact. He made Washington easy in his mind, though, by
      promising that he would call for it just as soon as the invention was
      finished, and he added the glad tidings that nobody but just they two
      should be admitted to a share in the speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Washington left the breakfast table he could have worshiped that man.
      Washington was one of that kind of people whose hopes are in the very
      clouds one day and in the gutter the next. He walked on air now. The
      Colonel was ready to take him around and introduce him to the employment
      he had found for him, but Washington begged for a few moments in which to
      write home; with his kind of people, to ride to-day&rsquo;s new interest to
      death and put off yesterday&rsquo;s till another time, is nature itself. He ran
      up stairs and wrote glowingly, enthusiastically, to his mother about the
      hogs and the corn, the banks and the eye-water&mdash;and added a few
      inconsequential millions to each project. And he said that people little
      dreamed what a man Col. Sellers was, and that the world would open its
      eyes when it found out. And he closed his letter thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So make yourself perfectly easy, mother-in a little while you shall have
      everything you want, and more. I am not likely to stint you in anything, I
      fancy. This money will not be for me, alone, but for all of us. I want all
      to share alike; and there is going to be far more for each than one person
      can spend. Break it to father cautiously&mdash;you understand the need of
      that&mdash;break it to him cautiously, for he has had such cruel hard
      fortune, and is so stricken by it that great good news might prostrate him
      more surely than even bad, for he is used to the bad but is grown sadly
      unaccustomed to the other. Tell Laura&mdash;tell all the children. And
      write to Clay about it if he is not with you yet. You may tell Clay that
      whatever I get he can freely share in-freely. He knows that that is true&mdash;there
      will be no need that I should swear to that to make him believe it.
      Good-bye&mdash;and mind what I say: Rest perfectly easy, one and all of
      you, for our troubles are nearly at an end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor lad, he could not know that his mother would cry some loving,
      compassionate tears over his letter and put off the family with a synopsis
      of its contents which conveyed a deal of love to them but not much idea of
      his prospects or projects. And he never dreamed that such a joyful letter
      could sadden her and fill her night with sighs, and troubled thoughts, and
      bodings of the future, instead of filling it with peace and blessing it
      with restful sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the letter was done, Washington and the Colonel sallied forth, and as
      they walked along Washington learned what he was to be. He was to be a
      clerk in a real estate office. Instantly the fickle youth&rsquo;s dreams forsook
      the magic eye-water and flew back to the Tennessee Land. And the gorgeous
      possibilities of that great domain straightway began to occupy his
      imagination to such a degree that he could scarcely manage to keep even
      enough of his attention upon the Colonel&rsquo;s talk to retain the general run
      of what he was saying. He was glad it was a real estate office&mdash;he
      was a made man now, sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel said that General Boswell was a rich man and had a good and
      growing business; and that Washington&rsquo;s work would be light and he would
      get forty dollars a month and be boarded and lodged in the General&rsquo;s
      family&mdash;which was as good as ten dollars more; and even better, for
      he could not live as well even at the &ldquo;City Hotel&rdquo; as he would there, and
      yet the hotel charged fifteen dollars a month where a man had a good room.

      General Boswell was in his office; a comfortable looking place, with
      plenty of outline maps hanging about the walls and in the windows, and a
      spectacled man was marking out another one on a long table. The office was
      in the principal street. The General received Washington with a kindly but
      reserved politeness. Washington rather liked his looks. He was about fifty
      years old, dignified, well preserved and well dressed. After the Colonel
      took his leave, the General talked a while with Washington&mdash;his talk
      consisting chiefly of instructions about the clerical duties of the place.
      He seemed satisfied as to Washington&rsquo;s ability to take care of the books,
      he was evidently a pretty fair theoretical bookkeeper, and experience
      would soon harden theory into practice. By and by dinner-time came, and
      the two walked to the General&rsquo;s house; and now Washington noticed an
      instinct in himself that moved him to keep not in the General&rsquo;s rear,
      exactly, but yet not at his side&mdash;somehow the old gentleman&rsquo;s dignity
      and reserve did not inspire familiarity.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington dreamed his way along the street, his fancy flitting from grain
      to hogs, from hogs to banks, from banks to eye-water, from eye-water to
      Tennessee Land, and lingering but a feverish moment upon each of these
      fascinations. He was conscious of but one outward thing, to wit, the
      General, and he was really not vividly conscious of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the finest dwelling in the town, they entered it and were at
      home. Washington was introduced to Mrs. Boswell, and his imagination was
      on the point of flitting into the vapory realms of speculation again, when
      a lovely girl of sixteen or seventeen came in. This vision swept
      Washington&rsquo;s mind clear of its chaos of glittering rubbish in an instant.
      Beauty had fascinated him before; many times he had been in love even for
      weeks at a time with the same object but his heart had never suffered so
      sudden and so fierce an assault as this, within his recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise Boswell occupied his mind and drifted among his multiplication
      tables all the afternoon. He was constantly catching himself in a reverie&mdash;reveries
      made up of recalling how she looked when she first burst upon him; how her
      voice thrilled him when she first spoke; how charmed the very air seemed
      by her presence. Blissful as the afternoon was, delivered up to such a
      revel as this, it seemed an eternity, so impatient was he to see the girl
      again. Other afternoons like it followed. Washington plunged into this
      love affair as he plunged into everything else&mdash;upon impulse and
      without reflection. As the days went by it seemed plain that he was
      growing in favor with Louise,&mdash;not sweepingly so, but yet
      perceptibly, he fancied. His attentions to her troubled her father and
      mother a little, and they warned Louise, without stating particulars or
      making allusions to any special person, that a girl was sure to make a
      mistake who allowed herself to marry anybody but a man who could support
      her well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some instinct taught Washington that his present lack of money would be an
      obstruction, though possibly not a bar, to his hopes, and straightway his
      poverty became a torture to him which cast all his former sufferings under
      that held into the shade. He longed for riches now as he had never longed
      for them before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been once or twice to dine with Col. Sellers, and had been
      discouraged to note that the Colonel&rsquo;s bill of fare was falling off both
      in quantity and quality&mdash;a sign, he feared, that the lacking
      ingredient in the eye-water still remained undiscovered&mdash;though
      Sellers always explained that these changes in the family diet had been
      ordered by the doctor, or suggested by some new scientific work the
      Colonel had stumbled upon. But it always turned out that the lacking
      ingredient was still lacking&mdash;though it always appeared, at the same
      time, that the Colonel was right on its heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time the Colonel came into the real estate office Washington&rsquo;s heart
      bounded and his eyes lighted with hope, but it always turned out that the
      Colonel was merely on the scent of some vast, undefined landed speculation&mdash;although
      he was customarily able to say that he was nearer to the all-necessary
      ingredient than ever, and could almost name the hour when success would
      dawn. And then Washington&rsquo;s heart would sink again and a sigh would tell
      when it touched bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time a letter came, saying that Judge Hawkins had been ailing
      for a fortnight, and was now considered to be seriously ill. It was
      thought best that Washington should come home. The news filled him with
      grief, for he loved and honored his father; the Boswells were touched by
      the youth&rsquo;s sorrow, and even the General unbent and said encouraging
      things to him.&mdash;There was balm in this; but when Louise bade him
      good-bye, and shook his hand and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cast down&mdash;it will
      all come out right&mdash;I know it will all come out right,&rdquo; it seemed a
      blessed thing to be in misfortune, and the tears that welled up to his
      eyes were the messengers of an adoring and a grateful heart; and when the
      girl saw them and answering tears came into her own eyes, Washington could
      hardly contain the excess of happiness that poured into the cavities of
      his breast that were so lately stored to the roof with grief.

      All the way home he nursed his woe and exalted it. He pictured himself as
      she must be picturing him: a noble, struggling young spirit persecuted by
      misfortune, but bravely and patiently waiting in the shadow of a dread
      calamity and preparing to meet the blow as became one who was all too used
      to hard fortune and the pitiless buffetings of fate. These thoughts made
      him weep, and weep more broken-heartedly than ever; and he wished that she
      could see his sufferings now.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing significant in the fact that Louise, dreamy and
      distraught, stood at her bedroom bureau that night, scribbling
      &ldquo;Washington&rdquo; here and there over a sheet of paper. But there was something
      significant in the fact that she scratched the word out every time she
      wrote it; examined the erasure critically to see if anybody could guess at
      what the word had been; then buried it under a maze of obliterating lines;
      and finally, as if still unsatisfied, burned the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Washington reached home, he recognized at once how serious his
      father&rsquo;s case was. The darkened room, the labored breathing and occasional
      moanings of the patient, the tip-toeing of the attendants and their
      whispered consultations, were full of sad meaning. For three or four
      nights Mrs. Hawkins and Laura had been watching by the bedside; Clay had
      arrived, preceding Washington by one day, and he was now added to the
      corps of watchers. Mr. Hawkins would have none but these three, though
      neighborly assistance was offered by old friends. From this time forth
      three-hour watches were instituted, and day and night the watchers kept
      their vigils. By degrees Laura and her mother began to show wear, but
      neither of them would yield a minute of their tasks to Clay. He ventured
      once to let the midnight hour pass without calling Laura, but he ventured
      no more; there was that about her rebuke when he tried to explain, that
      taught him that to let her sleep when she might be ministering to her
      father&rsquo;s needs, was to rob her of moments that were priceless in her eyes;
      he perceived that she regarded it as a privilege to watch, not a burden.
      And, he had noticed, also, that when midnight struck, the patient turned
      his eyes toward the door, with an expectancy in them which presently grew
      into a longing but brightened into contentment as soon as the door opened
      and Laura appeared. And he did not need Laura&rsquo;s rebuke when he heard his
      father say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clay is good, and you are tired, poor child; but I wanted you so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clay is not good, father&mdash;he did not call me. I would not have
      treated him so. How could you do it, Clay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clay begged forgiveness and promised not to break faith again; and as he
      betook him to his bed, he said to himself: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a steadfast little soul;
      whoever thinks he is doing the Duchess a kindness by intimating that she
      is not sufficient for any undertaking she puts her hand to, makes a
      mistake; and if I did not know it before, I know now that there are surer
      ways of pleasing her than by trying to lighten her labor when that labor
      consists in wearing herself out for the sake of a person she loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A week drifted by, and all the while the patient sank lower and lower. The
      night drew on that was to end all suspense. It was a wintry one. The
      darkness gathered, the snow was falling, the wind wailed plaintively about
      the house or shook it with fitful gusts. The doctor had paid his last
      visit and gone away with that dismal remark to the nearest friend of the
      family that he &ldquo;believed there was nothing more that he could do&rdquo;&mdash;a
      remark which is always overheard by some one it is not meant for and
      strikes a lingering half-conscious hope dead with a withering shock; the
      medicine phials had been removed from the bedside and put out of sight,
      and all things made orderly and meet for the solemn event that was
      impending; the patient, with closed eyes, lay scarcely breathing; the
      watchers sat by and wiped the gathering damps from his forehead while the
      silent tears flowed down their faces; the deep hush was only interrupted
      by sobs from the children, grouped about the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time&mdash;it was toward midnight now&mdash;Mr. Hawkins roused out
      of a doze, looked about him and was evidently trying to speak. Instantly
      Laura lifted his head and in a failing voice he said, while something of
      the old light shone in his eyes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife&mdash;children&mdash;come nearer&mdash;nearer. The darkness grows.
      Let me see you all, once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The group closed together at the bedside, and their tears and sobs came
      now without restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am leaving you in cruel poverty. I have been&mdash;so foolish&mdash;so
      short-sighted. But courage! A better day is&mdash;is coming. Never lose
      sight of the Tennessee Land! Be wary. There is wealth stored up for you
      there&mdash;wealth that is boundless! The children shall hold up their
      heads with the best in the land, yet. Where are the papers?&mdash;Have you
      got the papers safe? Show them&mdash;show them to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under his strong excitement his voice had gathered power and his last
      sentences were spoken with scarcely a perceptible halt or hindrance. With
      an effort he had raised himself almost without assistance to a sitting
      posture. But now the fire faded out of his eyes and he fell back
      exhausted. The papers were brought and held before him, and the answering
      smile that flitted across his face showed that he was satisfied. He closed
      his eyes, and the signs of approaching dissolution multiplied rapidly. He
      lay almost motionless for a little while, then suddenly partly raised his
      head and looked about him as one who peers into a dim uncertain light. He
      muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone? No&mdash;I see you&mdash;still. It is&mdash;it is-over. But you are&mdash;safe.
      Safe. The Ten&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voice died out in a whisper; the sentence was never finished. The
      emaciated fingers began to pick at the coverlet, a fatal sign. After a
      time there were no sounds but the cries of the mourners within and the
      gusty turmoil of the wind without. Laura had bent down and kissed her
      father&rsquo;s lips as the spirit left the body; but she did not sob, or utter
      any ejaculation; her tears flowed silently. Then she closed the dead eyes,
      and crossed the hands upon the breast; after a season, she kissed the
      forehead reverently, drew the sheet up over the face, and then walked
      apart and sat down with the look of one who is done with life and has no
      further interest in its joys and sorrows, its hopes or its ambitions. Clay
      buried his face in the coverlet of the bed; when the other children and
      the mother realized that death was indeed come at last, they threw
      themselves into each others&rsquo; arms and gave way to a frenzy of grief.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Only two or three days had elapsed since the funeral, when something
      happened which was to change the drift of Laura&rsquo;s life somewhat, and
      influence in a greater or lesser degree the formation of her character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Lackland had once been a man of note in the State&mdash;a man of
      extraordinary natural ability and as extraordinary learning. He had been
      universally trusted and honored in his day, but had finally, fallen into
      misfortune; while serving his third term in Congress, and while upon the
      point of being elevated to the Senate&mdash;which was considered the
      summit of earthly aggrandizement in those days&mdash;he had yielded to
      temptation, when in distress for money wherewith to save his estate; and
      sold his vote. His crime was discovered, and his fall followed instantly.
      Nothing could reinstate him in the confidence of the people, his ruin was
      irretrievable&mdash;his disgrace complete. All doors were closed against
      him, all men avoided him. After years of skulking retirement and
      dissipation, death had relieved him of his troubles at last, and his
      funeral followed close upon that of Mr. Hawkins. He died as he had
      latterly lived&mdash;wholly alone and friendless. He had no relatives&mdash;or
      if he had they did not acknowledge him. The coroner&rsquo;s jury found certain
      memoranda upon his body and about the premises which revealed a fact not
      suspected by the villagers before-viz., that Laura was not the child of
      Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gossips were soon at work. They were but little hampered by the fact
      that the memoranda referred to betrayed nothing but the bare circumstance
      that Laura&rsquo;s real parents were unknown, and stopped there. So far from
      being hampered by this, the gossips seemed to gain all the more freedom
      from it. They supplied all the missing information themselves, they filled
      up all the blanks. The town soon teemed with histories of Laura&rsquo;s origin
      and secret history, no two versions precisely alike, but all elaborate,
      exhaustive, mysterious and interesting, and all agreeing in one vital
      particular&mdash;to-wit, that there was a suspicious cloud about her
      birth, not to say a disreputable one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura began to encounter cold looks, averted eyes and peculiar nods and
      gestures which perplexed her beyond measure; but presently the pervading
      gossip found its way to her, and she understood them&mdash;then. Her pride
      was stung. She was astonished, and at first incredulous. She was about to
      ask her mother if there was any truth in these reports, but upon second
      thought held her peace. She soon gathered that Major Lackland&rsquo;s memoranda
      seemed to refer to letters which had passed between himself and Judge
      Hawkins. She shaped her course without difficulty the day that that hint
      reached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night she sat in her room till all was still, and then she stole into
      the garret and began a search. She rummaged long among boxes of musty
      papers relating to business matters of no interest to her, but at last she
      found several bundles of letters. One bundle was marked &ldquo;private,&rdquo; and in
      that she found what she wanted. She selected six or eight letters from the
      package and began to devour their contents, heedless of the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p100" id="p100"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p100.jpg (79K)" src="images/p100.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      By the dates, these letters were from five to seven years old. They were
      all from Major Lackland to Mr. Hawkins. The substance of them was, that
      some one in the east had been inquiring of Major Lackland about a lost
      child and its parents, and that it was conjectured that the child might be
      Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently some of the letters were missing, for the name of the inquirer
      was not mentioned; there was a casual reference to &ldquo;this handsome-featured
      aristocratic gentleman,&rdquo; as if the reader and the writer were accustomed
      to speak of him and knew who was meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one letter the Major said he agreed with Mr. Hawkins that the inquirer
      seemed not altogether on the wrong track; but he also agreed that it would
      be best to keep quiet until more convincing developments were forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another letter said that &ldquo;the poor soul broke completely down when he saw
      Laura&rsquo;s picture, and declared it must be she.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still another said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He seems entirely alone in the world, and his heart is so wrapped up in
        this thing that I believe that if it proved a false hope, it would kill
        him; I have persuaded him to wait a little while and go west when I go.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Another letter had this paragraph in it:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is better one day and worse the next, and is out of his mind a good
        deal of the time. Lately his case has developed a something which is a
        wonder to the hired nurses, but which will not be much of a marvel to
        you if you have read medical philosophy much. It is this: his lost
        memory returns to him when he is delirious, and goes away again when he
        is himself-just as old Canada Joe used to talk the French patois of his
        boyhood in the delirium of typhus fever, though he could not do it when
        his mind was clear. Now this poor gentleman&rsquo;s memory has always broken
        down before he reached the explosion of the steamer; he could only
        remember starting up the river with his wife and child, and he had an
        idea that there was a race, but he was not certain; he could not name
        the boat he was on; there was a dead blank of a month or more that
        supplied not an item to his recollection. It was not for me to assist
        him, of course. But now in his delirium it all comes out: the names of
        the boats, every incident of the explosion, and likewise the details of
        his astonishing escape&mdash;that is, up to where, just as a yawl-boat
        was approaching him (he was clinging to the starboard wheel of the
        burning wreck at the time), a falling timber struck him on the head. But
        I will write out his wonderful escape in full to-morrow or next day. Of
        course the physicians will not let me tell him now that our Laura is
        indeed his child&mdash;that must come later, when his health is
        thoroughly restored. His case is not considered dangerous at all; he
        will recover presently, the doctors say. But they insist that he must
        travel a little when he gets well&mdash;they recommend a short sea
        voyage, and they say he can be persuaded to try it if we continue to
        keep him in ignorance and promise to let him see L. as soon as he
        returns.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The letter that bore the latest date of all, contained this clause:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is the most unaccountable thing in the world; the mystery remains as
        impenetrable as ever; I have hunted high and low for him, and inquired
        of everybody, but in vain; all trace of him ends at that hotel in New
        York; I never have seen or heard of him since, up to this day; he could
        hardly have sailed, for his name does not appear upon the books of any
        shipping office in New York or Boston or Baltimore. How fortunate it
        seems, now, that we kept this thing to ourselves; Laura still has a
        father in you, and it is better for her that we drop this subject here
        forever.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      That was all. Random remarks here and there, being pieced together gave
      Laura a vague impression of a man of fine presence, about forty-three or
      forty-five years of age, with dark hair and eyes, and a slight limp in his
      walk&mdash;it was not stated which leg was defective. And this indistinct
      shadow represented her father. She made an exhaustive search for the
      missing letters, but found none. They had probably been burned; and she
      doubted not that the ones she had ferreted out would have shared the same
      fate if Mr. Hawkins had not been a dreamer, void of method, whose mind was
      perhaps in a state of conflagration over some bright new speculation when
      he received them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat long, with the letters in her lap, thinking&mdash;and
      unconsciously freezing. She felt like a lost person who has traveled down
      a long lane in good hope of escape, and, just as the night descends finds
      his progress barred by a bridge-less river whose further shore, if it has
      one, is lost in the darkness. If she could only have found these letters a
      month sooner! That was her thought. But now the dead had carried their
      secrets with them. A dreary, melancholy settled down upon her. An
      undefined sense of injury crept into her heart. She grew very miserable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had just reached the romantic age&mdash;the age when there is a sad
      sweetness, a dismal comfort to a girl to find out that there is a mystery
      connected with her birth, which no other piece of good luck can afford.
      She had more than her rightful share of practical good sense, but still
      she was human; and to be human is to have one&rsquo;s little modicum of romance
      secreted away in one&rsquo;s composition. One never ceases to make a hero of
      one&rsquo;s self, (in private,) during life, but only alters the style of his
      heroism from time to time as the drifting years belittle certain gods of
      his admiration and raise up others in their stead that seem greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recent wearing days and nights of watching, and the wasting grief that
      had possessed her, combined with the profound depression that naturally
      came with the reaction of idleness, made Laura peculiarly susceptible at
      this time to romantic impressions. She was a heroine, now, with a
      mysterious father somewhere. She could not really tell whether she wanted
      to find him and spoil it all or not; but still all the traditions of
      romance pointed to the making the attempt as the usual and necessary
      course to follow; therefore she would some day begin the search when
      opportunity should offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now a former thought struck her&mdash;she would speak to Mrs. Hawkins. And
      naturally enough Mrs. Hawkins appeared on the stage at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said she knew all&mdash;she knew that Laura had discovered the secret
      that Mr. Hawkins, the elder children, Col. Sellers and herself had kept so
      long and so faithfully; and she cried and said that now that troubles had
      begun they would never end; her daughter&rsquo;s love would wean itself away
      from her and her heart would break. Her grief so wrought upon Laura that
      the girl almost forgot her own troubles for the moment in her compassion
      for her mother&rsquo;s distress. Finally Mrs. Hawkins said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak to me, child&mdash;do not forsake me. Forget all this miserable
      talk. Say I am your mother!&mdash;I have loved you so long, and there is
      no other. I am your mother, in the sight of God, and nothing shall ever
      take you from me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All barriers fell, before this appeal. Laura put her arms about her
      mother&rsquo;s neck and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are my mother, and always shall be. We will be as we have always
      been; and neither this foolish talk nor any other thing shall part us or
      make us less to each other than we are this hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p105" id="p105"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no longer any sense of separation or estrangement between them.
      Indeed their love seemed more perfect now than it had ever been before. By
      and by they went down stairs and sat by the fire and talked long and
      earnestly about Laura&rsquo;s history and the letters. But it transpired that
      Mrs. Hawkins had never known of this correspondence between her husband
      and Major Lackland. With his usual consideration for his wife, Mr. Hawkins
      had shielded her from the worry the matter would have caused her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura went to bed at last with a mind that had gained largely in
      tranquility and had lost correspondingly in morbid romantic exaltation.
      She was pensive, the next day, and subdued; but that was not matter for
      remark, for she did not differ from the mournful friends about her in that
      respect. Clay and Washington were the same loving and admiring brothers
      now that they had always been. The great secret was new to some of the
      younger children, but their love suffered no change under the wonderful
      revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is barely possible that things might have presently settled down into
      their old rut and the mystery have lost the bulk of its romantic sublimity
      in Laura&rsquo;s eyes, if the village gossips could have quieted down. But they
      could not quiet down and they did not. Day after day they called at the
      house, ostensibly upon visits of condolence, and they pumped away at the
      mother and the children without seeming to know that their questionings
      were in bad taste. They meant no harm they only wanted to know. Villagers
      always want to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family fought shy of the questionings, and of course that was high
      testimony &ldquo;if the Duchess was respectably born, why didn&rsquo;t they come out
      and prove it?&mdash;why did they, stick to that poor thin story about
      picking her up out of a steamboat explosion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Under this ceaseless persecution, Laura&rsquo;s morbid self-communing was
      renewed. At night the day&rsquo;s contribution of detraction, innuendo and
      malicious conjecture would be canvassed in her mind, and then she would
      drift into a course of thinking. As her thoughts ran on, the indignant
      tears would spring to her eyes, and she would spit out fierce little
      ejaculations at intervals. But finally she would grow calmer and say some
      comforting disdainful thing&mdash;something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who are they?&mdash;Animals! What are their opinions to me? Let them
      talk&mdash;I will not stoop to be affected by it. I could hate&mdash;&mdash;.
      Nonsense&mdash;nobody I care for or in any way respect is changed toward
      me, I fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She may have supposed she was thinking of many individuals, but it was not
      so&mdash;she was thinking of only one. And her heart warmed somewhat, too,
      the while. One day a friend overheard a conversation like this:&mdash;and
      naturally came and told her all about it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ned, they say you don&rsquo;t go there any more. How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t; but I tell you it&rsquo;s not because I don&rsquo;t want to and it&rsquo;s
      not because I think it is any matter who her father was or who he wasn&rsquo;t,
      either; it&rsquo;s only on account of this talk, talk, talk. I think she is a
      fine girl every way, and so would you if you knew her as well as I do; but
      you know how it is when a girl once gets talked about&mdash;it&rsquo;s all up
      with her&mdash;the world won&rsquo;t ever let her alone, after that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The only comment Laura made upon this revelation, was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it appears that if this trouble had not occurred I could have had
      the happiness of Mr. Ned Thurston&rsquo;s serious attentions. He is well favored
      in person, and well liked, too, I believe, and comes of one of the first
      families of the village. He is prosperous, too, I hear; has been a doctor
      a year, now, and has had two patients&mdash;no, three, I think; yes, it
      was three. I attended their funerals. Well, other people have hoped and
      been disappointed; I am not alone in that. I wish you could stay to
      dinner, Maria&mdash;we are going to have sausages; and besides, I wanted
      to talk to you about Hawkeye and make you promise to come and see us when
      we are settled there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Maria could not stay. She had come to mingle romantic tears with
      Laura&rsquo;s over the lover&rsquo;s defection and had found herself dealing with a
      heart that could not rise to an appreciation of affliction because its
      interest was all centred in sausages.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as soon as Maria was gone, Laura stamped her expressive foot and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The coward! Are all books lies? I thought he would fly to the front, and
      be brave and noble, and stand up for me against all the world, and defy my
      enemies, and wither these gossips with his scorn! Poor crawling thing, let
      him go. I do begin to despise this world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lapsed into thought. Presently she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the time ever comes, and I get a chance, Oh, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not find a word that was strong enough, perhaps. By and by she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am glad of it&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad of it. I never cared anything for
      him anyway!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, with small consistency, she cried a little, and patted her foot
      more indignantly than ever.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two months had gone by and the Hawkins family were domiciled in Hawkeye.
      Washington was at work in the real estate office again, and was
      alternately in paradise or the other place just as it happened that Louise
      was gracious to him or seemingly indifferent&mdash;because indifference or
      preoccupation could mean nothing else than that she was thinking of some
      other young person. Col. Sellers had asked him several times, to dine with
      him, when he first returned to Hawkeye, but Washington, for no particular
      reason, had not accepted. No particular reason except one which he
      preferred to keep to himself&mdash;viz. that he could not bear to be away
      from Louise. It occurred to him, now, that the Colonel had not invited him
      lately&mdash;could he be offended? He resolved to go that very day, and
      give the Colonel a pleasant surprise. It was a good idea; especially as
      Louise had absented herself from breakfast that morning, and torn his
      heart; he would tear hers, now, and let her see how it felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sellers family were just starting to dinner when Washington burst upon
      them with his surprise. For an instant the Colonel looked nonplussed, and
      just a bit uncomfortable; and Mrs. Sellers looked actually distressed; but
      the next moment the head of the house was himself again, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, my boy, all right&mdash;always glad to see you&mdash;always
      glad to hear your voice and take you by the hand. Don&rsquo;t wait for special
      invitations&mdash;that&rsquo;s all nonsense among friends. Just come whenever
      you can, and come as often as you can&mdash;the oftener the better. You
      can&rsquo;t please us any better than that, Washington; the little woman will
      tell you so herself. We don&rsquo;t pretend to style. Plain folks, you know&mdash;plain
      folks. Just a plain family dinner, but such as it is, our friends are
      always welcome, I reckon you know that yourself, Washington. Run along,
      children, run along; Lafayette,&mdash;[**In those old days the average man
      called his children after his most revered literary and historical idols;
      consequently there was hardly a family, at least in the West, but had a
      Washington in it&mdash;and also a Lafayette, a Franklin, and six or eight
      sounding names from Byron, Scott, and the Bible, if the offspring held
      out. To visit such a family, was to find one&rsquo;s self confronted by a
      congress made up of representatives of the imperial myths and the majestic
      dead of all the ages. There was something thrilling about it, to a
      stranger, not to say awe inspiring.]&mdash;stand off the cat&rsquo;s tail,
      child, can&rsquo;t you see what you&rsquo;re doing?&mdash;Come, come, come, Roderick
      Dhu, it isn&rsquo;t nice for little boys to hang onto young gentlemen&rsquo;s coat
      tails&mdash;but never mind him, Washington, he&rsquo;s full of spirits and don&rsquo;t
      mean any harm. Children will be children, you know. Take the chair next to
      Mrs. Sellers, Washington&mdash;tut, tut, Marie Antoinette, let your
      brother have the fork if he wants it, you are bigger than he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington contemplated the banquet, and wondered if he were in his right
      mind. Was this the plain family dinner? And was it all present? It was
      soon apparent that this was indeed the dinner: it was all on the table: it
      consisted of abundance of clear, fresh water, and a basin of raw turnips&mdash;nothing
      more.
    </p>
    <p>

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington stole a glance at Mrs. Sellers&rsquo;s face, and would have given the
      world, the next moment, if he could have spared her that. The poor woman&rsquo;s
      face was crimson, and the tears stood in her eyes. Washington did not know
      what to do. He wished he had never come there and spied out this cruel
      poverty and brought pain to that poor little lady&rsquo;s heart and shame to her
      cheek; but he was there, and there was no escape. Col. Sellers hitched
      back his coat sleeves airily from his wrists as who should say &ldquo;Now for
      solid enjoyment!&rdquo; seized a fork, flourished it and began to harpoon
      turnips and deposit them in the plates before him &ldquo;Let me help you,
      Washington&mdash;Lafayette, pass this plate to Washington&mdash;ah, well,
      well, my boy, things are looking pretty bright, now, I tell you.
      Speculation&mdash;my! the whole atmosphere&rsquo;s full of money. I would&rsquo;nt
      take three fortunes for one little operation I&rsquo;ve got on hand now&mdash;have
      anything from the casters? No? Well, you&rsquo;re right, you&rsquo;re right. Some
      people like mustard with turnips, but&mdash;now there was Baron
      Poniatowski&mdash;Lord, but that man did know how to live!&mdash;true
      Russian you know, Russian to the back bone; I say to my wife, give me a
      Russian every time, for a table comrade. The Baron used to say, &lsquo;Take
      mustard, Sellers, try the mustard,&mdash;a man can&rsquo;t know what turnips are
      in perfection without, mustard,&rsquo; but I always said, &lsquo;No, Baron, I&rsquo;m a
      plain man and I want my food plain&mdash;none of your embellishments for
      Beriah Sellers&mdash;no made dishes for me! And it&rsquo;s the best way&mdash;high
      living kills more than it cures in this world, you can rest assured of
      that.&mdash;Yes indeed, Washington, I&rsquo;ve got one little operation on hand
      that&mdash;take some more water&mdash;help yourself, won&rsquo;t you?&mdash;help
      yourself, there&rsquo;s plenty of it.&mdash;You&rsquo;ll find it pretty good, I guess.
      How does that fruit strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington said he did not know that he had ever tasted better. He did not
      add that he detested turnips even when they were cooked&mdash;loathed them
      in their natural state. No, he kept this to himself, and praised the
      turnips to the peril of his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d like them. Examine them&mdash;examine them&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
      bear it. See how perfectly firm and juicy they are&mdash;they can&rsquo;t start
      any like them in this part of the country, I can tell you. These are from
      New Jersey&mdash;I imported them myself. They cost like sin, too; but lord
      bless me, I go in for having the best of a thing, even if it does cost a
      little more&mdash;it&rsquo;s the best economy, in the long run. These are the
      Early Malcolm&mdash;it&rsquo;s a turnip that can&rsquo;t be produced except in just
      one orchard, and the supply never is up to the demand. Take some more
      water, Washington&mdash;you can&rsquo;t drink too much water with fruit&mdash;all
      the doctors say that. The plague can&rsquo;t come where this article is, my
      boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plague? What plague?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What plague, indeed? Why the Asiatic plague that nearly depopulated
      London a couple of centuries ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how does that concern us? There is no plague here, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! I&rsquo;ve let it out! Well, never mind&mdash;just keep it to yourself.
      Perhaps I oughtn&rsquo;t said anything, but its bound to come out sooner or
      later, so what is the odds? Old McDowells wouldn&rsquo;t like me to&mdash;to&mdash;bother
      it all, I&rsquo;ll jest tell the whole thing and let it go. You see, I&rsquo;ve been
      down to St. Louis, and I happened to run across old Dr. McDowells&mdash;thinks
      the world of me, does the doctor. He&rsquo;s a man that keeps himself to
      himself, and well he may, for he knows that he&rsquo;s got a reputation that
      covers the whole earth&mdash;he won&rsquo;t condescend to open himself out to
      many people, but lord bless you, he and I are just like brothers; he won&rsquo;t
      let me go to a hotel when I&rsquo;m in the city&mdash;says I&rsquo;m the only man
      that&rsquo;s company to him, and I don&rsquo;t know but there&rsquo;s some truth in it, too,
      because although I never like to glorify myself and make a great to-do
      over what I am or what I can do or what I know, I don&rsquo;t mind saying here
      among friends that I am better read up in most sciences, maybe, than the
      general run of professional men in these days. Well, the other day he let
      me into a little secret, strictly on the quiet, about this matter of the
      plague.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it&rsquo;s booming right along in our direction&mdash;follows the Gulf
      Stream, you know, just as all those epidemics do, and within three months
      it will be just waltzing through this land like a whirlwind! And whoever
      it touches can make his will and contract for the funeral. Well you can&rsquo;t
      cure it, you know, but you can prevent it. How? Turnips! that&rsquo;s it!
      Turnips and water! Nothing like it in the world, old McDowells says, just
      fill yourself up two or three times a day, and you can snap your fingers
      at the plague. Sh!&mdash;keep mum, but just you confine yourself to that
      diet and you&rsquo;re all right. I wouldn&rsquo;t have old McDowells know that I told
      about it for anything&mdash;he never would speak to me again. Take some
      more water, Washington&mdash;the more water you drink, the better. Here,
      let me give you some more of the turnips. No, no, no, now, I insist.
      There, now. Absorb those. They&rsquo;re, mighty sustaining&mdash;brim full of
      nutriment&mdash;all the medical books say so. Just eat from four to seven
      good-sized turnips at a meal, and drink from a pint and a half to a quart
      of water, and then just sit around a couple of hours and let them ferment.
      You&rsquo;ll feel like a fighting cock next day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fifteen or twenty minutes later the Colonel&rsquo;s tongue was still chattering
      away&mdash;he had piled up several future fortunes out of several
      incipient &ldquo;operations&rdquo; which he had blundered into within the past week,
      and was now soaring along through some brilliant expectations born of late
      promising experiments upon the lacking ingredient of the eye-water. And at
      such a time Washington ought to have been a rapt and enthusiastic
      listener, but he was not, for two matters disturbed his mind and
      distracted his attention. One was, that he discovered, to his confusion
      and shame, that in allowing himself to be helped a second time to the
      turnips, he had robbed those hungry children. He had not needed the
      dreadful &ldquo;fruit,&rdquo; and had not wanted it; and when he saw the pathetic
      sorrow in their faces when they asked for more and there was no more to
      give them, he hated himself for his stupidity and pitied the famishing
      young things with all his heart. The other matter that disturbed him was
      the dire inflation that had begun in his stomach. It grew and grew, it
      became more and more insupportable. Evidently the turnips were
      &ldquo;fermenting.&rdquo; He forced himself to sit still as long as he could, but his
      anguish conquered him at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose in the midst of the Colonel&rsquo;s talk and excused himself on the plea
      of a previous engagement. The Colonel followed him to the door, promising
      over and over again that he would use his influence to get some of the
      Early Malcolms for him, and insisting that he should not be such a
      stranger but come and take pot-luck with him every chance he got.
      Washington was glad enough to get away and feel free again. He immediately
      bent his steps toward home.
    </p>
    <p>
      In bed he passed an hour that threatened to turn his hair gray, and then a
      blessed calm settled down upon him that filled his heart with gratitude.
      Weak and languid, he made shift to turn himself about and seek rest and
      sleep; and as his soul hovered upon the brink of unconciousness, he heaved
      a long, deep sigh, and said to himself that in his heart he had cursed the
      Colonel&rsquo;s preventive of rheumatism, before, and now let the plague come if
      it must&mdash;he was done with preventives; if ever any man beguiled him
      with turnips and water again, let him die the death.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he dreamed at all that night, no gossiping spirit disturbed his visions
      to whisper in his ear of certain matters just then in bud in the East,
      more than a thousand miles away that after the lapse of a few years would
      develop influences which would profoundly affect the fate and fortunes of
      the Hawkins family.

      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy enough to make a fortune,&rdquo; Henry said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to be easier than it is, I begin to think,&rdquo; replied Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you go into something? You&rsquo;ll never dig it out of the
      Astor Library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If there be any place and time in the world where and when it seems easy
      to &ldquo;go into something&rdquo; it is in Broadway on a spring morning, when one is
      walking city-ward, and has before him the long lines of palace-shops with
      an occasional spire seen through the soft haze that lies over the lower
      town, and hears the roar and hum of its multitudinous traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the young American, here or elsewhere, the paths to fortune are
      innumerable and all open; there is invitation in the air and success in
      all his wide horizon. He is embarrassed which to choose, and is not
      unlikely to waste years in dallying with his chances, before giving
      himself to the serious tug and strain of a single object. He has no
      traditions to bind him or guide him, and his impulse is to break away from
      the occupation his father has followed, and make a new way for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip Sterling used to say that if he should seriously set himself for
      ten years to any one of the dozen projects that were in his brain, he felt
      that he could be a rich man. He wanted to be rich, he had a sincere desire
      for a fortune, but for some unaccountable reason he hesitated about
      addressing himself to the narrow work of getting it. He never walked
      Broadway, a part of its tide of abundant shifting life, without feeling
      something of the flush of wealth, and unconsciously taking the elastic
      step of one well-to-do in this prosperous world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Especially at night in the crowded theatre&mdash;Philip was too young to
      remember the old Chambers&rsquo; Street box, where the serious Burton led his
      hilarious and pagan crew&mdash;in the intervals of the screaming comedy,
      when the orchestra scraped and grunted and tooted its dissolute tunes, the
      world seemed full of opportunities to Philip, and his heart exulted with a
      conscious ability to take any of its prizes he chose to pluck.

      Perhaps it was the swimming ease of the acting, on the stage, where virtue
      had its reward in three easy acts, perhaps it was the excessive light of
      the house, or the music, or the buzz of the excited talk between acts,
      perhaps it was youth which believed everything, but for some reason while
      Philip was at the theatre he had the utmost confidence in life and his
      ready victory in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delightful illusion of paint and tinsel and silk attire, of cheap
      sentiment and high and mighty dialogue! Will there not always be rosin
      enough for the squeaking fiddle-bow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Do we not all like the maudlin hero, who is sneaking round the right
      entrance, in wait to steal the pretty wife of his rich and tyrannical
      neighbor from the paste-board cottage at the left entrance? and when he
      advances down to the foot-lights and defiantly informs the audience that,
      &ldquo;he who lays his hand on a woman except in the way of kindness,&rdquo; do we not
      all applaud so as to drown the rest of the sentence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip never was fortunate enough to hear what would become of a man who
      should lay his hand on a woman with the exception named; but he learned
      afterwards that the woman who lays her hand on a man, without any
      exception whatsoever, is always acquitted by the jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, though Philip Sterling did not know it, that he wanted
      several other things quite as much as he wanted wealth. The modest fellow
      would have liked fame thrust upon him for some worthy achievement; it
      might be for a book, or for the skillful management of some great
      newspaper, or for some daring expedition like that of Lt. Strain or Dr.
      Kane. He was unable to decide exactly what it should be. Sometimes he
      thought he would like to stand in a conspicuous pulpit and humbly preach
      the gospel of repentance; and it even crossed his mind that it would be
      noble to give himself to a missionary life to some benighted region, where
      the date-palm grows, and the nightingale&rsquo;s voice is in tune, and the
      bul-bul sings on the off nights. If he were good enough he would attach
      himself to that company of young men in the Theological Seminary, who were
      seeing New York life in preparation for the ministry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was a New England boy and had graduated at Yale; he had not carried
      off with him all the learning of that venerable institution, but he knew
      some things that were not in the regular course of study. A very good use
      of the English language and considerable knowledge of its literature was
      one of them; he could sing a song very well, not in time to be sure, but
      with enthusiasm; he could make a magnetic speech at a moment&rsquo;s notice in
      the class room, the debating society, or upon any fence or dry-goods box
      that was convenient; he could lift himself by one arm, and do the giant
      swing in the gymnasium; he could strike out from his left shoulder; he
      could handle an oar like a professional and pull stroke in a winning race.
      Philip had a good appetite, a sunny temper, and a clear hearty laugh. He
      had brown hair, hazel eyes set wide apart, a broad but not high forehead,
      and a fresh winning face. He was six feet high, with broad shoulders, long
      legs and a swinging gait; one of those loose-jointed, capable fellows, who
      saunter into the world with a free air and usually make a stir in whatever
      company they enter.

      After he left college Philip took the advice of friends and read law. Law
      seemed to him well enough as a science, but he never could discover a
      practical case where it appeared to him worth while to go to law, and all
      the clients who stopped with this new clerk in the ante-room of the law
      office where he was writing, Philip invariably advised to settle&mdash;no
      matter how, but settle&mdash;greatly to the disgust of his employer, who
      knew that justice between man and man could only be attained by the
      recognized processes, with the attendant fees. Besides Philip hated the
      copying of pleadings, and he was certain that a life of &ldquo;whereases&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;aforesaids&rdquo; and whipping the devil round the stump, would be intolerable.

    </p>
    <p>
      His pen therefore, and whereas, and not as aforesaid, strayed off into
      other scribbling. In an unfortunate hour, he had two or three papers
      accepted by first-class magazines, at three dollars the printed page, and,
      behold, his vocation was open to him. He would make his mark in
      literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life has no moment so sweet as that in which a young man believes himself
      called into the immortal ranks of the masters of literature. It is such a
      noble ambition, that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow
      foundation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of this history, Philip had gone to New York for a career.
      With his talent he thought he should have little difficulty in getting an
      editorial position upon a metropolitan newspaper; not that he knew
      anything about newspaper work, or had the least idea of journalism; he
      knew he was not fitted for the technicalities of the subordinate
      departments, but he could write leaders with perfect ease, he was sure.
      The drudgery of the newspaper office was too distasteful, and besides it
      would be beneath the dignity of a graduate and a successful magazine
      writer. He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise he found that every situation in the editorial department
      of the journals was full, always had been full, was always likely to be
      full. It seemed to him that the newspaper managers didn&rsquo;t want genius, but
      mere plodding and grubbing. Philip therefore read diligently in the Astor
      library, planned literary works that should compel attention, and nursed
      his genius. He had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the
      Dorking Convention, then in session, make a sketch of the men and women on
      the platform, and take it to the editor of the Daily Grapevine, and see
      what he could get a line for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he had an offer from some country friends, who believed in him, to
      take charge of a provincial daily newspaper, and he went to consult Mr.
      Gringo&mdash;Gringo who years ago managed the Atlas&mdash;about taking the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it of course,&rdquo; says Gringo, &ldquo;take anything that offers, why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they want me to make it an opposition paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, make it that. That party is going to succeed, it&rsquo;s going to elect
      the next president.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Philip, stoutly, &ldquo;its wrong in principle, and
      it ought not to succeed, but I don&rsquo;t see how I can go for a thing I don&rsquo;t
      believe in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, very well,&rdquo; said Gringo, turning away with a shade of contempt,
      &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find if you are going into literature and newspaper work that you
      can&rsquo;t afford a conscience like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Philip did afford it, and he wrote, thanking his friends, and
      declining because he said the political scheme would fail, and ought to
      fail. And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening
      large enough for his dignified entrance into the literary world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in this time of rather impatient waiting that Philip was one
      morning walking down Broadway with Henry Brierly. He frequently
      accompanied Henry part way down town to what the latter called his office
      in Broad Street, to which he went, or pretended to go, with regularity
      every day. It was evident to the most casual acquaintance that he was a
      man of affairs, and that his time was engrossed in the largest sort of
      operations, about which there was a mysterious air. His liability to be
      suddenly summoned to Washington, or Boston or Montreal or even to
      Liverpool was always imminent. He never was so summoned, but none of his
      acquaintances would have been surprised to hear any day that he had gone
      to Panama or Peoria, or to hear from him that he had bought the Bank of
      Commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two were intimate at that time,&mdash;they had been classmates&mdash;and
      saw a great deal of each other. Indeed, they lived together in Ninth
      Street, in a boarding-house, there, which had the honor of lodging and
      partially feeding several other young fellows of like kidney, who have
      since gone their several ways into fame or into obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during the morning walk to which reference has been made that Henry
      Brierly suddenly said, &ldquo;Philip, how would you like to go to St. Jo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I should like it of all things,&rdquo; replied Philip, with some
      hesitation, &ldquo;but what for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a big operation. We are going, a lot of us, railroad men,
      engineers, contractors. You know my uncle is a great railroad man. I&rsquo;ve no
      doubt I can get you a chance to go if you&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in what capacity would I go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going as an engineer. You can go as one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know an engine from a coal cart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Field engineer, civil engineer. You can begin by carrying a rod, and
      putting down the figures. It&rsquo;s easy enough. I&rsquo;ll show you about that.
      We&rsquo;ll get Trautwine and some of those books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but what is it for, what is it all about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you see? We lay out a line, spot the good land, enter it up,
      know where the stations are to be, spot them, buy lots; there&rsquo;s heaps of
      money in it. We wouldn&rsquo;t engineer long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you go?&rdquo; was Philip&rsquo;s next question, after some moments of
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow. Is that too soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, its not too soon. I&rsquo;ve been ready to go anywhere for six months. The
      fact is, Henry, that I&rsquo;m about tired of trying to force myself into
      things, and am quite willing to try floating with the stream for a while,
      and see where I will land. This seems like a providential call; it&rsquo;s
      sudden enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two young men who were by this time full of the adventure, went down
      to the Wall street office of Henry&rsquo;s uncle and had a talk with that wily
      operator. The uncle knew Philip very well, and was pleased with his frank
      enthusiasm, and willing enough to give him a trial in the western venture.
      It was settled therefore, in the prompt way in which things are settled in
      New York, that they would start with the rest of the company next morning
      for the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way up town these adventurers bought books on engineering, and
      suits of India-rubber, which they supposed they would need in a new and
      probably damp country, and many other things which nobody ever needed
      anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would
      not take such an important step without informing his friends. If they
      disapprove, thought he, I&rsquo;ve done my duty by letting them know. Happy
      youth, that is ready to pack its valise, and start for Cathay on an hour&rsquo;s
      notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; calls out Philip from his bed-room, to Henry, &ldquo;where is St.
      Jo.?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s in Missouri somewhere, on the frontier I think. We&rsquo;ll get a
      map.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the map. We will find the place itself. I was afraid it was
      nearer home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip wrote a long letter, first of all, to his mother, full of love and
      glowing anticipations of his new opening. He wouldn&rsquo;t bother her with
      business details, but he hoped that the day was not far off when she would
      see him return, with a moderate fortune, and something to add to the
      comfort of her advancing years.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his uncle he said that he had made an arrangement with some New York
      capitalists to go to Missouri, in a land and railroad operation, which
      would at least give him a knowledge of the world and not unlikely offer
      him a business opening. He knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he
      had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to Ruth Bolton that Philip wrote last. He might never see her
      again; he went to seek his fortune. He well knew the perils of the
      frontier, the savage state of society, the lurking Indians and the dangers
      of fever. But there was no real danger to a person who took care of
      himself. Might he write to her often and, tell her of his life. If he
      returned with a fortune, perhaps and perhaps. If he was unsuccessful, or
      if he never returned&mdash;perhaps it would be as well. No time or
      distance, however, would ever lessen his interest in her. He would say
      good-night, but not good-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the soft beginning of a Spring morning, long before New York had
      breakfasted, while yet the air of expectation hung about the wharves of
      the metropolis, our young adventurers made their way to the Jersey City
      railway station of the Erie road, to begin the long, swinging, crooked
      journey, over what a writer of a former day called a causeway of cracked
      rails and cows, to the West.

    <p>
      In the party of which our travelers found themselves members, was Duff
      Brown, the great railroad contractor, and subsequently a well-known member
      of Congress; a bluff, jovial Bost&rsquo;n man, thick-set, close shaven, with a
      heavy jaw and a low forehead&mdash;a very pleasant man if you were not in
      his way. He had government contracts also, custom houses and dry docks,
      from Portland to New Orleans, and managed to get out of congress, in
      appropriations, about weight for weight of gold for the stone furnished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Associated with him, and also of this party, was Rodney Schaick, a sleek
      New York broker, a man as prominent in the church as in the stock
      exchange, dainty in his dress, smooth of speech, the necessary complement
      of Duff Brown in any enterprise that needed assurance and adroitness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be difficult to find a pleasanter traveling party, one that shook
      off more readily the artificial restraints of Puritanic strictness, and
      took the world with good-natured allowance. Money was plenty for every
      attainable luxury, and there seemed to be no doubt that its supply would
      continue, and that fortunes were about to be made without a great deal of
      toil. Even Philip soon caught the prevailing spirit; Barry did not need
      any inoculation, he always talked in six figures. It was as natural for
      the dear boy to be rich as it is for most people to be poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elders of the party were not long in discovering the fact, which
      almost all travelers to the west soon find out; that the water was poor.
      It must have been by a lucky premonition of this that they all had brandy
      flasks with which to qualify the water of the country; and it was no doubt
      from an uneasy feeling of the danger of being poisoned that they kept
      experimenting, mixing a little of the dangerous and changing fluid, as
      they passed along, with the contents of the flasks, thus saving their
      lives hour by hour. Philip learned afterwards that temperance and the
      strict observance of Sunday and a certain gravity of deportment are
      geographical habits, which people do not usually carry with them away from
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our travelers stopped in Chicago long enough to see that they could make
      their fortunes there in two week&rsquo;s time, but it did not seem worth while;
      the west was more attractive; the further one went the wider the
      opportunities opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took railroad to Alton and the steamboat from there to St. Louis, for
      the change and to have a glimpse of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this jolly?&rdquo; cried Henry, dancing out of the barber&rsquo;s room, and
      coming down the deck with a one, two, three step, shaven, curled and
      perfumed after his usual exquisite fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s jolly?&rdquo; asked Philip, looking out upon the dreary and monotonous
      waste through which the shaking steamboat was coughing its way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the whole thing; it&rsquo;s immense I can tell you. I wouldn&rsquo;t give that
      to be guaranteed a hundred thousand cold cash in a year&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Brown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is in the saloon, playing poker with Schaick and that long haired
      party with the striped trousers, who scrambled aboard when the stage plank
      was half hauled in, and the big Delegate to Congress from out west.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine looking fellow, that delegate, with his glossy, black
      whiskers; looks like a Washington man; I shouldn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d be at
      poker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, its only five cent ante, just to make it interesting, the Delegate
      said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shouldn&rsquo;t think a representative in Congress would play poker any
      way in a public steamboat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, you&rsquo;ve got to pass the time. I tried a hand myself, but those
      old fellows are too many for me. The Delegate knows all the points. I&rsquo;d
      bet a hundred dollars he will ante his way right into the United States
      Senate when his territory comes in. He&rsquo;s got the cheek for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has the grave and thoughtful manner of expectoration of a public man,
      for one thing,&rdquo; added Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said Philip, after a pause, &ldquo;what have you got on those big boots
      for; do you expect to wade ashore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m breaking &lsquo;em in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact was Harry had got himself up in what he thought a proper costume
      for a new country, and was in appearance a sort of compromise between a
      dandy of Broadway and a backwoodsman. Harry, with blue eyes, fresh
      complexion, silken whiskers and curly chestnut hair, was as handsome as a
      fashion plate. He wore this morning a soft hat, a short cutaway coat, an
      open vest displaying immaculate linen, a leathern belt round his waist,
      and top-boots of soft leather, well polished, that came above his knees
      and required a string attached to his belt to keep them up. The light
      hearted fellow gloried in these shining encasements of his well shaped
      legs, and told Philip that they were a perfect protection against prairie
      rattle-snakes, which never strike above the knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landscape still wore an almost wintry appearance when our travelers
      left Chicago. It was a genial spring day when they landed at St. Louis;
      the birds were singing, the blossoms of peach trees in city garden plots,
      made the air sweet, and in the roar and tumult on the long river levee
      they found an excitement that accorded with their own hopeful
      anticipations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party went to the Southern Hotel, where the great Duff Brown was very
      well known, and indeed was a man of so much importance that even the
      office clerk was respectful to him. He might have respected in him also a
      certain vulgar swagger and insolence of money, which the clerk greatly
      admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellows liked the house and liked the city; it seemed to them a
      mighty free and hospitable town. Coming from the East they were struck
      with many peculiarities. Everybody smoked in the streets, for one thing,
      they noticed; everybody &ldquo;took a drink&rdquo; in an open manner whenever he
      wished to do so or was asked, as if the habit needed no concealment or
      apology. In the evening when they walked about they found people sitting
      on the door-steps of their dwellings, in a manner not usual in a northern
      city; in front of some of the hotels and saloons the side walks were
      filled with chairs and benches&mdash;Paris fashion, said Harry&mdash;upon
      which people lounged in these warm spring evenings, smoking, always
      smoking; and the clink of glasses and of billiard balls was in the air. It
      was delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry at once found on landing that his back-woods custom would not be
      needed in St. Louis, and that, in fact, he had need of all the resources
      of his wardrobe to keep even with the young swells of the town. But this
      did not much matter, for Harry was always superior to his clothes. As they
      were likely to be detained some time in the city, Harry told Philip that
      he was going to improve his time. And he did. It was an encouragement to
      any industrious man to see this young fellow rise, carefully dress
      himself, eat his breakfast deliberately, smoke his cigar tranquilly, and
      then repair to his room, to what he called his work, with a grave and
      occupied manner, but with perfect cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry would take off his coat, remove his cravat, roll up his
      shirt-sleeves, give his curly hair the right touch before the glass, get
      out his book on engineering, his boxes of instruments, his drawing paper,
      his profile paper, open the book of logarithms, mix his India ink, sharpen
      his pencils, light a cigar, and sit down at the table to &ldquo;lay out a line,&rdquo;
       with the most grave notion that he was mastering the details of
      engineering. He would spend half a day in these preparations without ever
      working out a problem or having the faintest conception of the use of
      lines or logarithms. And when he had finished, he had the most cheerful
      confidence that he had done a good day&rsquo;s work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made no difference, however, whether Harry was in his room in a hotel
      or in a tent, Philip soon found, he was just the same. In camp he would
      get himself up in the most elaborate toilet at his command, polish his
      long boots to the top, lay out his work before him, and spend an hour or
      longer, if anybody was looking at him, humming airs, knitting his brows,
      and &ldquo;working&rdquo; at engineering; and if a crowd of gaping rustics were
      looking on all the while it was perfectly satisfactory to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he says to Philip one morning at the hotel when he was thus
      engaged, &ldquo;I want to get the theory of this thing, so that I can have a
      check on the engineers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were going to be an engineer yourself,&rdquo; queried Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many times, if the court knows herself. There&rsquo;s better game. Brown
      and Schaick have, or will have, the control for the whole line of the Salt
      Lick Pacific Extension, forty thousand dollars a mile over the prairie,
      with extra for hard-pan&mdash;and it&rsquo;ll be pretty much all hardpan I can
      tell you; besides every alternate section of land on this line. There&rsquo;s
      millions in the job. I&rsquo;m to have the sub-contract for the first fifty
      miles, and you can bet it&rsquo;s a soft thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you do, Philip,&rdquo; continued Larry, in a burst of
      generosity, &ldquo;if I don&rsquo;t get you into my contract, you&rsquo;ll be with the
      engineers, and you jest stick a stake at the first ground marked for a
      depot, buy the land of the farmer before he knows where the depot will be,
      and we&rsquo;ll turn a hundred or so on that. I&rsquo;ll advance the money for the
      payments, and you can sell the lots. Schaick is going to let me have ten
      thousand just for a flyer in such operations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that&rsquo;s a good deal of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait till you are used to handling money. I didn&rsquo;t come out here for a
      bagatelle. My uncle wanted me to stay East and go in on the Mobile custom
      house, work up the Washington end of it; he said there was a fortune in it
      for a smart young fellow, but I preferred to take the chances out here.
      Did I tell you I had an offer from Bobbett and Fanshaw to go into their
      office as confidential clerk on a salary of ten thousand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you take it?&rdquo; asked Philip, to whom a salary of two thousand
      would have seemed wealth, before he started on this journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it? I&rsquo;d rather operate on my own hook;&rdquo; said Harry, in his most airy
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few evenings after their arrival at the Southern, Philip and Harry made
      the acquaintance of a very agreeable gentleman, whom they had frequently
      seen before about the hotel corridors, and passed a casual word with. He
      had the air of a man of business, and was evidently a person of
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The precipitating of this casual intercourse into the more substantial
      form of an acquaintanceship was the work of the gentleman himself, and
      occurred in this wise. Meeting the two friends in the lobby one evening,
      he asked them to give him the time, and added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, gentlemen&mdash;strangers in St. Louis? Ah, yes-yes. From the
      East, perhaps? Ah; just so, just so. Eastern born myself&mdash;Virginia.
      Sellers is my name&mdash;Beriah Sellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! by the way&mdash;New York, did you say? That reminds me; just met
      some gentlemen from your State, a week or two ago&mdash;very prominent
      gentlemen&mdash;in public life they are; you must know them, without
      doubt. Let me see&mdash;let me see. Curious those names have escaped me. I
      know they were from your State, because I remember afterward my old friend
      Governor Shackleby said to me&mdash;fine man, is the Governor&mdash;one of
      the finest men our country has produced&mdash;said he, &lsquo;Colonel, how did
      you like those New York gentlemen?&mdash;not many such men in the world,&mdash;Colonel
      Sellers,&rsquo; said the Governor&mdash;yes, it was New York he said&mdash;I
      remember it distinctly. I can&rsquo;t recall those names, somehow. But no
      matter. Stopping here, gentlemen&mdash;stopping at the Southern?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p128" id="p128"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p128.jpg (31K)" src="images/p128.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In shaping their reply in their minds, the title &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo; had a place in it;
      but when their turn had arrived to speak, the title &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; came from
      their lips instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      They said yes, they were abiding at the Southern, and thought it a very
      good house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, the Southern is fair. I myself go to the Planter&rsquo;s, old,
      aristocratic house. We Southern gentlemen don&rsquo;t change our ways, you know.
      I always make it my home there when I run down from Hawkeye&mdash;my
      plantation is in Hawkeye, a little up in the country. You should know the
      Planter&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip and Harry both said they should like to see a hotel that had been
      so famous in its day&mdash;a cheerful hostelrie, Philip said it must have
      been where duels were fought there across the dining-room table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may believe it, sir, an uncommonly pleasant lodging. Shall we walk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the three strolled along the streets, the Colonel talking all the way
      in the most liberal and friendly manner, and with a frank open-heartedness
      that inspired confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, born East myself, raised all along, know the West&mdash;a great
      country, gentlemen. The place for a young fellow of spirit to pick up a
      fortune, simply pick it up, it&rsquo;s lying round loose here. Not a day that I
      don&rsquo;t put aside an opportunity; too busy to look into it. Management of my
      own property takes my time. First visit? Looking for an opening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, looking around,&rdquo; replied Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here we are. You&rsquo;d rather sit here in front than go to my apartments?
      So had I. An opening eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Ah, just so. The country is opening up, all
      we want is capital to develop it. Slap down the rails and bring the land
      into market. The richest land on God Almighty&rsquo;s footstool is lying right
      out there. If I had my capital free I could plant it for millions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose your capital is largely in your plantation?&rdquo; asked Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, partly, sir, partly. I&rsquo;m down here now with reference to a little
      operation&mdash;a little side thing merely. By the way gentlemen, excuse
      the liberty, but it&rsquo;s about my usual time&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel paused, but as no movement of his acquaintances followed this
      plain remark, he added, in an explanatory manner,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather particular about the exact time&mdash;have to be in this
      climate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even this open declaration of his hospitable intention not being
      understood the Colonel politely said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, will you take something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Col. Sellers led the way to a saloon on Fourth street under the hotel, and
      the young gentlemen fell into the custom of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that,&rdquo; said the Colonel to the bar-keeper, who shoved along the
      counter a bottle of apparently corn-whiskey, as if he had done it before
      on the same order; &ldquo;not that,&rdquo; with a wave of the hand. &ldquo;That Otard if you
      please. Yes. Never take an inferior liquor, gentlemen, not in the evening,
      in this climate. There. That&rsquo;s the stuff. My respects!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p131" id="p131"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p131.jpg (40K)" src="images/p131.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The hospitable gentleman, having disposed of his liquor, remarking that it
      was not quite the thing&mdash;&ldquo;when a man has his own cellar to go to, he
      is apt to get a little fastidious about his liquors&rdquo;&mdash;called for
      cigars. But the brand offered did not suit him; he motioned the box away,
      and asked for some particular Havana&rsquo;s, those in separate wrappers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always smoke this sort, gentlemen; they are a little more expensive,
      but you&rsquo;ll learn, in this climate, that you&rsquo;d better not economize on poor
      cigars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having imparted this valuable piece of information, the Colonel lighted
      the fragrant cigar with satisfaction, and then carelessly put his fingers
      into his right vest pocket. That movement being without result, with a
      shade of disappointment on his face, he felt in his left vest pocket. Not
      finding anything there, he looked up with a serious and annoyed air,
      anxiously slapped his right pantaloon&rsquo;s pocket, and then his left, and
      exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, that&rsquo;s annoying. By George, that&rsquo;s mortifying. Never had
      anything of that kind happen to me before. I&rsquo;ve left my pocket-book. Hold!
      Here&rsquo;s a bill, after all. No, thunder, it&rsquo;s a receipt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; said Philip, seeing how seriously the Colonel was annoyed, and
      taking out his purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel protested he couldn&rsquo;t think of it, and muttered something to
      the barkeeper about &ldquo;hanging it up,&rdquo; but the vender of exhilaration made
      no sign, and Philip had the privilege of paying the costly shot; Col.
      Sellers profusely apologizing and claiming the right &ldquo;next time, next
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Beriah Sellers had bade his friends good night and seen them
      depart, he did not retire apartments in the Planter&rsquo;s, but took his way to
      his lodgings with a friend in a distant part of the city.

    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter that Philip Sterling wrote to Ruth Bolton, on the evening of
      setting out to seek his fortune in the west, found that young lady in her
      own father&rsquo;s house in Philadelphia. It was one of the pleasantest of the
      many charming suburban houses in that hospitable city, which is
      territorially one of the largest cities in the world, and only prevented
      from becoming the convenient metropolis of the country by the intrusive
      strip of Camden and Amboy sand which shuts it off from the Atlantic ocean.
      It is a city of steady thrift, the arms of which might well be the
      deliberate but delicious terrapin that imparts such a royal flavor to its
      feasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a spring morning, and perhaps it was the influence of it that made
      Ruth a little restless, satisfied neither with the out-doors nor the
      in-doors. Her sisters had gone to the city to show some country visitors
      Independence Hall, Girard College and Fairmount Water Works and Park, four
      objects which Americans cannot die peacefully, even in Naples, without
      having seen. But Ruth confessed that she was tired of them, and also of
      the Mint. She was tired of other things. She tried this morning an air or
      two upon the piano, sang a simple song in a sweet but slightly metallic
      voice, and then seating herself by the open window, read Philip&rsquo;s letter.
      Was she thinking about Philip, as she gazed across the fresh lawn over the
      tree tops to the Chelton Hills, or of that world which his entrance, into
      her tradition-bound life had been one of the means of opening to her?
      Whatever she thought, she was not idly musing, as one might see by the
      expression of her face. After a time she took up a book; it was a medical
      work, and to all appearance about as interesting to a girl of eighteen as
      the statutes at large; but her face was soon aglow over its pages, and she
      was so absorbed in it that she did not notice the entrance of her mother
      at the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; said the young student, looking up, with a shade of
      impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to talk with thee a little about thy plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p134" id="p134"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p134.jpg (35K)" src="images/p134.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother; thee knows I couldn&rsquo;t stand it at Westfield; the school stifled
      me, it&rsquo;s a place to turn young people into dried fruit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Margaret Bolton, with a half anxious smile, &ldquo;thee chafes
      against all the ways of Friends, but what will thee do? Why is thee so
      discontented?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I must say it, mother, I want to go away, and get out of this dead
      level.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a look half of pain and half of pity, her mother answered, &ldquo;I am sure
      thee is little interfered with; thee dresses as thee will, and goes where
      thee pleases, to any church thee likes, and thee has music. I had a visit
      yesterday from the society&rsquo;s committee by way of discipline, because we
      have a piano in the house, which is against the rules.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope thee told the elders that father and I are responsible for the
      piano, and that, much as thee loves music, thee is never in the room when
      it is played. Fortunately father is already out of meeting, so they can&rsquo;t
      discipline him. I heard father tell cousin Abner that he was whipped so
      often for whistling when he was a boy that he was determined to have what
      compensation he could get now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy ways greatly try me, Ruth, and all thy relations. I desire thy
      happiness first of all, but thee is starting out on a dangerous path. Is
      thy father willing thee should go away to a school of the world&rsquo;s people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not asked him,&rdquo; Ruth replied with a look that might imply that she
      was one of those determined little bodies who first made up her own mind
      and then compelled others to make up theirs in accordance with hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when thee has got the education thee wants, and lost all relish for
      the society of thy friends and the ways of thy ancestors, what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth turned square round to her mother, and with an impassive face and not
      the slightest change of tone, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I&rsquo;m going to study medicine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Bolton almost lost for a moment her habitual placidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thee, study medicine! A slight frail girl like thee, study medicine! Does
      thee think thee could stand it six months? And the lectures, and the
      dissecting rooms, has thee thought of the dissecting rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; said Ruth calmly, &ldquo;I have thought it all over. I know I can go
      through the whole, clinics, dissecting room and all. Does thee think I
      lack nerve? What is there to fear in a person dead more than in a person
      living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But thy health and strength, child; thee can never stand the severe
      application. And, besides, suppose thee does learn medicine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will practice it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where thee and thy family are known?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can get patients.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope at least, Ruth, thee will let us know when thee opens an office,&rdquo;
       said her mother, with an approach to sarcasm that she rarely indulged in,
      as she rose and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth sat quite still for a time, with face intent and flushed. It was out
      now. She had begun her open battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight-seers returned in high spirits from the city. Was there any
      building in Greece to compare with Girard College, was there ever such a
      magnificent pile of stone devised for the shelter of poor orphans? Think
      of the stone shingles of the roof eight inches thick! Ruth asked the
      enthusiasts if they would like to live in such a sounding mausoleum, with
      its great halls and echoing rooms, and no comfortable place in it for the
      accommodation of any body? If they were orphans, would they like to be
      brought up in a Grecian temple?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was Broad street! Wasn&rsquo;t it the broadest and the longest
      street in the world? There certainly was no end to it, and even Ruth was
      Philadelphian enough to believe that a street ought not to have any end,
      or architectural point upon which the weary eye could rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither St. Girard, nor Broad street, neither wonders of the Mint nor
      the glories of the Hall where the ghosts of our fathers sit always signing
      the Declaration; impressed the visitors so much as the splendors of the
      Chestnut street windows, and the bargains on Eighth street. The truth is
      that the country cousins had come to town to attend the Yearly Meeting,
      and the amount of shopping that preceded that religious event was scarcely
      exceeded by the preparations for the opera in more worldly circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is thee going to the Yearly Meeting, Ruth?&rdquo; asked one of the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have nothing to wear,&rdquo; replied that demure person. &ldquo;If thee wants to
      see new bonnets, orthodox to a shade and conformed to the letter of the
      true form, thee must go to the Arch Street Meeting. Any departure from
      either color or shape would be instantly taken note of. It has occupied
      mother a long time, to find at the shops the exact shade for her new
      bonnet. Oh, thee must go by all means. But thee won&rsquo;t see there a sweeter
      woman than mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thee won&rsquo;t go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I? I&rsquo;ve been again and again. If I go to Meeting at all I like
      best to sit in the quiet old house in Germantown, where the windows are
      all open and I can see the trees, and hear the stir of the leaves. It&rsquo;s
      such a crush at the Yearly Meeting at Arch Street, and then there&rsquo;s the
      row of sleek-looking young men who line the curbstone and stare at us as
      we come out. No, I don&rsquo;t feel at home there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Ruth and her father sat late by the drawing-room fire, as
      they were quite apt to do at night. It was always a time of confidences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thee has another letter from young Sterling,&rdquo; said Eli Bolton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Philip has gone to the far west.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t say, but it&rsquo;s on the frontier, and on the map everything
      beyond it is marked &lsquo;Indians&rsquo; and &lsquo;desert,&rsquo; and looks as desolate as a
      Wednesday Meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph. It was time for him to do something. Is he going to start a daily
      newspaper among the Kick-a-poos?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, thee&rsquo;s unjust to Philip. He&rsquo;s going into business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of business can a young man go into without capital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t say exactly what it is,&rdquo; said Ruth a little dubiously, &ldquo;but
      it&rsquo;s something about land and railroads, and thee knows, father, that
      fortunes are made nobody knows exactly how, in a new country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think so, you innocent puss, and in an old one too. But Philip
      is honest, and he has talent enough, if he will stop scribbling, to make
      his way. But thee may as well take care of theeself, Ruth, and not go
      dawdling along with a young man in his adventures, until thy own mind is a
      little more settled what thee wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This excellent advice did not seem to impress Ruth greatly, for she was
      looking away with that abstraction of vision which often came into her
      grey eyes, and at length she exclaimed, with a sort of impatience,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could go west, or south, or somewhere. What a box women are put
      into, measured for it, and put in young; if we go anywhere it&rsquo;s in a box,
      veiled and pinioned and shut in by disabilities. Father, I should like to
      break things and get loose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a sweet-voiced little innocent, it was to be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thee will no doubt break things enough when thy time comes, child; women
      always have; but what does thee want now that thee hasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to be something, to make myself something, to do something. Why
      should I rust, and be stupid, and sit in inaction because I am a girl?
      What would happen to me if thee should lose thy property and die? What one
      useful thing could I do for a living, for the support of mother and the
      children? And if I had a fortune, would thee want me to lead a useless
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has thy mother led a useless life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhat that depends upon whether her children amount to anything,&rdquo;
       retorted the sharp little disputant. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the good, father, of a series
      of human beings who don&rsquo;t advance any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Friend Eli, who had long ago laid aside the Quaker dress, and was out of
      Meeting, and who in fact after a youth of doubt could not yet define his
      belief, nevertheless looked with some wonder at this fierce young eagle of
      his, hatched in a Friend&rsquo;s dove-cote. But he only said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has thee consulted thy mother about a career, I suppose it is a career
      thee wants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth did not reply directly; she complained that her mother didn&rsquo;t
      understand her. But that wise and placid woman understood the sweet rebel
      a great deal better than Ruth understood herself. She also had a history,
      possibly, and had sometime beaten her young wings against the cage of
      custom, and indulged in dreams of a new social order, and had passed
      through that fiery period when it seems possible for one mind, which has
      not yet tried its limits, to break up and re-arrange the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth replied to Philip&rsquo;s letter in due time and in the most cordial and
      unsentimental manner. Philip liked the letter, as he did everything she
      did; but he had a dim notion that there was more about herself in the
      letter than about him. He took it with him from the Southern Hotel, when
      he went to walk, and read it over and again in an unfrequented street as
      he stumbled along. The rather common-place and unformed hand-writing
      seemed to him peculiar and characteristic, different from that of any
      other woman.

      Ruth was glad to hear that Philip had made a push into the world, and she
      was sure that his talent and courage would make a way for him. She should
      pray for his success at any rate, and especially that the Indians, in St.
      Louis, would not take his scalp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked rather dubious at this sentence, and wished that he had
      written nothing about Indians.

      Eli Bolton and his wife talked over Ruth&rsquo;s case, as they had often done
      before, with no little anxiety. Alone of all their children she was
      impatient of the restraints and monotony of the Friends&rsquo; Society, and
      wholly indisposed to accept the &ldquo;inner light&rdquo; as a guide into a life of
      acceptance and inaction. When Margaret told her husband of Ruth&rsquo;s newest
      project, he did not exhibit so much surprise as she hoped for. In fact he
      said that he did not see why a woman should not enter the medical
      profession if she felt a call to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;consider her total inexperience of the world, and
      her frail health. Can such a slight little body endure the ordeal of the
      preparation for, or the strain of, the practice of the profession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did thee ever think, Margaret, whether, she can endure being thwarted in
      an object on which she has so set her heart, as she has on this? Thee has
      trained her thyself at home, in her enfeebled childhood, and thee knows
      how strong her will is, and what she has been able to accomplish in
      self-culture by the simple force of her determination. She never will be
      satisfied until she has tried her own strength.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Margaret, with an inconsequence that is not exclusively
      feminine, &ldquo;that she were in the way to fall in love and marry by and by. I
      think that would cure her of some of her notions. I am not sure but if she
      went away, to some distant school, into an entirely new life, her thoughts
      would be diverted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eli Bolton almost laughed as he regarded his wife, with eyes that never
      looked at her except fondly, and replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps thee remembers that thee had notions also, before we were
      married, and before thee became a member of Meeting. I think Ruth comes
      honestly by certain tendencies which thee has hidden under the Friend&rsquo;s
      dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret could not say no to this, and while she paused, it was evident
      that memory was busy with suggestions to shake her present opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not let Ruth try the study for a time,&rdquo; suggested Eli; &ldquo;there is a
      fair beginning of a Woman&rsquo;s Medical College in the city. Quite likely she
      will soon find that she needs first a more general culture, and fall in
      with thy wish that she should see more of the world at some large school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There really seemed to be nothing else to be done, and Margaret consented
      at length without approving. And it was agreed that Ruth, in order to
      spare her fatigue, should take lodgings with friends near the college and
      make a trial in the pursuit of that science to which we all owe our lives,
      and sometimes as by a miracle of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day Mr. Bolton brought home a stranger to dinner, Mr. Bigler of the
      great firm of Pennybacker, Bigler &amp; Small, railroad contractors. He
      was always bringing home somebody, who had a scheme; to build a road, or
      open a mine, or plant a swamp with cane to grow paper-stock, or found a
      hospital, or invest in a patent shad-bone separator, or start a college
      somewhere on the frontier, contiguous to a land speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bolton house was a sort of hotel for this kind of people. They were
      always coming. Ruth had known them from childhood, and she used to say
      that her father attracted them as naturally as a sugar hogshead does
      flies. Ruth had an idea that a large portion of the world lived by getting
      the rest of the world into schemes. Mr. Bolton never could say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any
      of them, not even, said Ruth again, to the society for stamping oyster
      shells with scripture texts before they were sold at retail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigler&rsquo;s plan this time, about which he talked loudly, with his mouth
      full, all dinner time, was the building of the Tunkhannock, Rattlesnake
      and Youngwomans Town Railroad, which would not only be a great highway to
      the west, but would open to market inexhaustible coal-fields and untold
      millions of lumber. The plan of operations was very simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll buy the lands,&rdquo; explained he, &ldquo;on long time, backed by the notes of
      good men; and then mortgage them for money enough to get the road well on.
      Then get the towns on the line to issue their bonds for stock, and sell
      their bonds for enough to complete the road, and partly stock it,
      especially if we mortgage each section as we complete it. We can then sell
      the rest of the stock on the prospect of the business of the road through
      an improved country, and also sell the lands at a big advance, on the
      strength of the road. All we want,&rdquo; continued Mr. Bigler in his frank
      manner, &ldquo;is a few thousand dollars to start the surveys, and arrange
      things in the legislature. There is some parties will have to be seen, who
      might make us trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will take a good deal of money to start the enterprise,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
      Bolton, who knew very well what &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; a Pennsylvania Legislature meant,
      but was too polite to tell Mr. Bigler what he thought of him, while he was
      his guest; &ldquo;what security would one have for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigler smiled a hard kind of smile, and said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be inside, Mr.
      Bolton, and you&rsquo;d have the first chance in the deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was rather unintelligible to Ruth, who was nevertheless somewhat
      amused by the study of a type of character she had seen before. At length
      she interrupted the conversation by asking,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d sell the stock, I suppose, Mr. Bigler, to anybody who was attracted
      by the prospectus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, certainly, serve all alike,&rdquo; said Mr. Bigler, now noticing Ruth for
      the first time, and a little puzzled by the serene, intelligent face that
      was turned towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what would become of the poor people who had been led to put their
      little money into the speculation, when you got out of it and left it half
      way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would be no more true to say of Mr. Bigler that he was or could be
      embarrassed, than to say that a brass counterfeit dollar-piece would
      change color when refused; the question annoyed him a little, in Mr.
      Bolton&rsquo;s presence.

      &ldquo;Why, yes, Miss, of course, in a great enterprise for the benefit of the
      community there will little things occur, which, which&mdash;and, of
      course, the poor ought to be looked to; I tell my wife, that the poor must
      be looked to; if you can tell who are poor&mdash;there&rsquo;s so many
      impostors. And then, there&rsquo;s so many poor in the legislature to be looked
      after,&rdquo; said the contractor with a sort of a chuckle, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t that so, Mr.
      Bolton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eli Bolton replied that he never had much to do with the legislature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued this public benefactor, &ldquo;an uncommon poor lot this year,
      uncommon. Consequently an expensive lot. The fact is, Mr. Bolton, that the
      price is raised so high on United States Senator now, that it affects the
      whole market; you can&rsquo;t get any public improvement through on reasonable
      terms. Simony is what I call it, Simony,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Bigler, as if he
      had said a good thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigler went on and gave some very interesting details of the intimate
      connection between railroads and politics, and thoroughly entertained
      himself all dinner time, and as much disgusted Ruth, who asked no more
      questions, and her father who replied in monosyllables:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Ruth to her father, after the guest had gone, &ldquo;that you
      wouldn&rsquo;t bring home any more such horrid men. Do all men who wear big
      diamond breast-pins, flourish their knives at table, and use bad grammar,
      and cheat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, child, thee mustn&rsquo;t be too observing. Mr. Bigler is one of the most
      important men in the state; nobody has more influence at Harrisburg. I
      don&rsquo;t like him any more than thee does, but I&rsquo;d better lend him a little
      money than to have his ill will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I think thee&rsquo;d better have his ill-will than his company. Is it
      true that he gave money to help build the pretty little church of St.
      James the Less, and that he is, one of the vestrymen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He is not such a bad fellow. One of the men in Third street asked
      him the other day, whether his was a high church or a low church? Bigler
      said he didn&rsquo;t know; he&rsquo;d been in it once, and he could touch the ceiling
      in the side aisle with his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s just horrid,&rdquo; was Ruth&rsquo;s final summary of him, after the
      manner of the swift judgment of women, with no consideration of the
      extenuating circumstances. Mr. Bigler had no idea that he had not made a
      good impression on the whole family; he certainly intended to be
      agreeable. Margaret agreed with her daughter, and though she never said
      anything to such people, she was grateful to Ruth for sticking at least
      one pin into him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the serenity of the Bolton household that a stranger in it would
      never have suspected there was any opposition to Ruth&rsquo;s going to the
      Medical School. And she went quietly to take her residence in town, and
      began her attendance of the lectures, as if it were the most natural thing
      in the world. She did not heed, if she heard, the busy and wondering
      gossip of relations and acquaintances, gossip that has no less currency
      among the Friends than elsewhere because it is whispered slyly and creeps
      about in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth was absorbed, and for the first time in her life thoroughly happy;
      happy in the freedom of her life, and in the keen enjoyment of the
      investigation that broadened its field day by day. She was in high spirits
      when she came home to spend First Days; the house was full of her gaiety
      and her merry laugh, and the children wished that Ruth would never go away
      again. But her mother noticed, with a little anxiety, the sometimes
      flushed face, and the sign of an eager spirit in the kindling eyes, and,
      as well, the serious air of determination and endurance in her face at
      unguarded moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The college was a small one and it sustained itself not without difficulty
      in this city, which is so conservative, and is yet the origin of so many
      radical movements. There were not more than a dozen attendants on the
      lectures all together, so that the enterprise had the air of an
      experiment, and the fascination of pioneering for those engaged in it.
      There was one woman physician driving about town in her carriage,
      attacking the most violent diseases in all quarters with persistent
      courage, like a modern Bellona in her war chariot, who was popularly
      supposed to gather in fees to the amount ten to twenty thousand dollars a
      year. Perhaps some of these students looked forward to the near day when
      they would support such a practice and a husband besides, but it is
      unknown that any of them ever went further than practice in hospitals and
      in their own nurseries, and it is feared that some of them were quite as
      ready as their sisters, in emergencies, to &ldquo;call a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Ruth had any exaggerated expectations of a professional life, she kept
      them to herself, and was known to her fellows of the class simply as a
      cheerful, sincere student, eager in her investigations, and never
      impatient at anything, except an insinuation that women had not as much
      mental capacity for science as men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They really say,&rdquo; said one young Quaker sprig to another youth of his
      age, &ldquo;that Ruth Bolton is really going to be a saw-bones, attends
      lectures, cuts up bodies, and all that. She&rsquo;s cool enough for a surgeon,
      anyway.&rdquo; He spoke feelingly, for he had very likely been weighed in Ruth&rsquo;s
      calm eyes sometime, and thoroughly scared by the little laugh that
      accompanied a puzzling reply to one of his conversational nothings. Such
      young gentlemen, at this time, did not come very distinctly into Ruth&rsquo;s
      horizon, except as amusing circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the details of her student life, Ruth said very little to her
      friends, but they had reason to know, afterwards, that it required all her
      nerve and the almost complete exhaustion of her physical strength, to
      carry her through. She began her anatomical practice upon detached
      portions of the human frame, which were brought into the demonstrating
      room&mdash;dissecting the eye, the ear, and a small tangle of muscles and
      nerves&mdash;an occupation which had not much more savor of death in it
      than the analysis of a portion of a plant out of which the life went when
      it was plucked up by the roots. Custom inures the most sensitive persons
      to that which is at first most repellant; and in the late war we saw the
      most delicate women, who could not at home endure the sight of blood,
      become so used to scenes of carnage, that they walked the hospitals and
      the margins of battle-fields, amid the poor remnants of torn humanity,
      with as perfect self-possession as if they were strolling in a flower
      garden.

      It happened that Ruth was one evening deep in a line of investigation
      which she could not finish or understand without demonstration, and so
      eager was she in it, that it seemed as if she could not wait till the next
      day. She, therefore, persuaded a fellow student, who was reading that
      evening with her, to go down to the dissecting room of the college, and
      ascertain what they wanted to know by an hour&rsquo;s work there. Perhaps, also,
      Ruth wanted to test her own nerve, and to see whether the power of
      association was stronger in her mind than her own will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The janitor of the shabby and comfortless old building admitted the girls,
      not without suspicion, and gave them lighted candles, which they would
      need, without other remark than &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a new one, Miss,&rdquo; as the girls
      went up the broad stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They climbed to the third story, and paused before a door, which they
      unlocked, and which admitted them into a long apartment, with a row of
      windows on one side and one at the end. The room was without light, save
      from the stars and the candles the girls carried, which revealed to them
      dimly two long and several small tables, a few benches and chairs, a
      couple of skeletons hanging on the wall, a sink, and cloth-covered heaps
      of something upon the tables here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows were open, and the cool night wind came in strong enough to
      flutter a white covering now and then, and to shake the loose casements.
      But all the sweet odors of the night could not take from the room a faint
      suggestion of mortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young ladies paused a moment. The room itself was familiar enough, but
      night makes almost any chamber eerie, and especially such a room of
      detention as this where the mortal parts of the unburied might&mdash;almost
      be supposed to be, visited, on the sighing night winds, by the wandering
      spirits of their late tenants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposite and at some distance across the roofs of lower buildings, the
      girls saw a tall edifice, the long upper story of which seemed to be a
      dancing hall. The windows of that were also open, and through them they
      heard the scream of the jiggered and tortured violin, and the pump, pump
      of the oboe, and saw the moving shapes of men and women in quick
      transition, and heard the prompter&rsquo;s drawl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;what the girls dancing there would think if they
      saw us, or knew that there was such a room as this so near them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not speak very loud, and, perhaps unconsciously, the girls drew
      near to each other as they approached the long table in the centre of the
      room. A straight object lay upon it, covered with a sheet. This was
      doubtless &ldquo;the new one&rdquo; of which the janitor spoke. Ruth advanced, and
      with a not very steady hand lifted the white covering from the upper part
      of the figure and turned it down. Both the girls started. It was a negro.
      The black face seemed to defy the pallor of death, and asserted an ugly
      life-likeness that was frightful.

    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth was as pale as the white sheet, and her comrade whispered, &ldquo;Come
      away, Ruth, it is awful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the wavering light of the candles, perhaps it was only the
      agony from a death of pain, but the repulsive black face seemed to wear a
      scowl that said, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you yet done with the outcast, persecuted black
      man, but you must now haul him from his grave, and send even your women to
      dismember his body?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Who is this dead man, one of thousands who died yesterday, and will be
      dust anon, to protest that science shall not turn his worthless carcass to
      some account?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth could have had no such thought, for with a pity in her sweet face,
      that for the moment overcame fear and disgust, she reverently replaced the
      covering, and went away to her own table, as her companion did to hers.
      And there for an hour they worked at their several problems, without
      speaking, but not without an awe of the presence there, &ldquo;the new one,&rdquo; and
      not without an awful sense of life itself, as they heard the pulsations of
      the music and the light laughter from the dancing-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, at length, they went away, and locked the dreadful room behind them,
      and came out into the street, where people were passing, they, for the
      first time, realized, in the relief they felt, what a nervous strain they
      had been under.

      While Ruth was thus absorbed in her new occupation, and the spring was
      wearing away, Philip and his friends were still detained at the Southern
      Hotel. The great contractors had concluded their business with the state
      and railroad officials and with the lesser contractors, and departed for
      the East. But the serious illness of one of the engineers kept Philip and
      Henry in the city and occupied in alternate watchings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip wrote to Ruth of the new acquaintance they had made, Col. Sellers,
      an enthusiastic and hospitable gentleman, very much interested in the
      development of the country, and in their success. They had not had an
      opportunity to visit at his place &ldquo;up in the country&rdquo; yet, but the Colonel
      often dined with them, and in confidence, confided to them his projects,
      and seemed to take a great liking to them, especially to his friend Harry.
      It was true that he never seemed to have ready money, but he was engaged
      in very large operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The correspondence was not very brisk between these two young persons, so
      differently occupied; for though Philip wrote long letters, he got brief
      ones in reply, full of sharp little observations however, such as one
      concerning Col. Sellers, namely, that such men dined at their house every
      week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth&rsquo;s proposed occupation astonished Philip immensely, but while he
      argued it and discussed it, he did not dare hint to her his fear that it
      would interfere with his most cherished plans. He too sincerely respected
      Ruth&rsquo;s judgment to make any protest, however, and he would have defended
      her course against the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      This enforced waiting at St. Louis was very irksome to Philip. His money
      was running away, for one thing, and he longed to get into the field, and
      see for himself what chance there was for a fortune or even an occupation.
      The contractors had given the young men leave to join the engineer corps
      as soon as they could, but otherwise had made no provision for them, and
      in fact had left them with only the most indefinite expectations of
      something large in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was entirely happy; in his circumstances. He very soon knew
      everybody, from the governor of the state down to the waiters at the
      hotel. He had the Wall street slang at his tongue&rsquo;s end; he always talked
      like a capitalist, and entered with enthusiasm into all the land and
      railway schemes with which the air was thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Sellers and Harry talked together by the hour and by the day. Harry
      informed his new friend that he was going out with the engineer corps of
      the Salt Lick Pacific Extension, but that wasn&rsquo;t his real business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to have, with another party,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;a big contract in the
      road, as soon as it is let; and, meantime, I&rsquo;m with the engineers to spy
      out the best land and the depot sites.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s everything,&rdquo; suggested the Colonel, &ldquo;in knowing where to invest.
      I&rsquo;ve known people throwaway their money because they were too
      consequential to take Sellers&rsquo; advice. Others, again, have made their pile
      on taking it. I&rsquo;ve looked over the ground; I&rsquo;ve been studying it for
      twenty years. You can&rsquo;t put your finger on a spot in the map of Missouri
      that I don&rsquo;t know as if I&rsquo;d made it. When you want to place anything,&rdquo;
       continued the Colonel, confidently, &ldquo;just let Beriah Sellers know. That&rsquo;s
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t got much in ready money I can lay my hands on now, but if a
      fellow could do anything with fifteen or twenty thousand dollars, as a
      beginning, I shall draw for that when I see the right opening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s something, that&rsquo;s something, fifteen or twenty thousand
      dollars, say twenty&mdash;as an advance,&rdquo; said the Colonel reflectively,
      as if turning over his mind for a project that could be entered on with
      such a trifling sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p151" id="p151"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is&mdash;but only to you Mr. Brierly, only to you,
      mind; I&rsquo;ve got a little project that I&rsquo;ve been keeping. It looks small,
      looks small on paper, but it&rsquo;s got a big future. What should you say, sir,
      to a city, built up like the rod of Aladdin had touched it, built up in
      two years, where now you wouldn&rsquo;t expect it any more than you&rsquo;d expect a
      light-house on the top of Pilot Knob? and you could own the land! It can
      be done, sir. It can be done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel hitched up his chair close to Harry, laid his hand on his
      knee, and, first looking about him, said in a low voice, &ldquo;The Salt Lick
      Pacific Extension is going to run through Stone&rsquo;s Landing! The Almighty
      never laid out a cleaner piece of level prairie for a city; and it&rsquo;s the
      natural center of all that region of hemp and tobacco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think the road will go there? It&rsquo;s twenty miles, on the
      map, off the straight line of the road?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell what is the straight line till the engineers have been
      over it. Between us, I have talked with Jeff Thompson, the division
      engineer. He understands the wants of Stone&rsquo;s Landing, and the claims of
      the inhabitants&mdash;who are to be there. Jeff says that a railroad is
      for&mdash;the accommodation of the people and not for the benefit of
      gophers; and if, he don&rsquo;t run this to Stone&rsquo;s Landing he&rsquo;ll be damned! You
      ought to know Jeff; he&rsquo;s one of the most enthusiastic engineers in this
      western country, and one of the best fellows that ever looked through the
      bottom of a glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The recommendation was not undeserved. There was nothing that Jeff
      wouldn&rsquo;t do, to accommodate a friend, from sharing his last dollar with
      him, to winging him in a duel. When he understood from Col. Sellers. how
      the land lay at Stone&rsquo;s Landing, he cordially shook hands with that
      gentleman, asked him to drink, and fairly roared out, &ldquo;Why, God bless my
      soul, Colonel, a word from one Virginia gentleman to another is &lsquo;nuff
      ced.&rsquo; There&rsquo;s Stone&rsquo;s Landing been waiting for a railroad more than four
      thousand years, and damme if she shan&rsquo;t have it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip had not so much faith as Harry in Stone&rsquo;s Landing, when the latter
      opened the project to him, but Harry talked about it as if he already
      owned that incipient city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry thoroughly believed in all his projects and inventions, and lived
      day by day in their golden atmosphere. Everybody liked the young fellow,
      for how could they help liking one of such engaging manners and large
      fortune? The waiters at the hotel would do more for him than for any other
      guest, and he made a great many acquaintances among the people of St.
      Louis, who liked his sensible and liberal views about the development of
      the western country, and about St. Louis. He said it ought to be the
      national capital. Harry made partial arrangements with several of the
      merchants for furnishing supplies for his contract on the Salt Lick
      Pacific Extension; consulted the maps with the engineers, and went over
      the profiles with the contractors, figuring out estimates for bids. He was
      exceedingly busy with those things when he was not at the bedside of his
      sick acquaintance, or arranging the details of his speculation with Col.
      Sellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime the days went along and the weeks, and the money in Harry&rsquo;s
      pocket got lower and lower. He was just as liberal with what he had as
      before, indeed it was his nature to be free with his money or with that of
      others, and he could lend or spend a dollar with an air that made it seem
      like ten. At length, at the end of one week, when his hotel bill was
      presented, Harry found not a cent in his pocket to meet it. He carelessly
      remarked to the landlord that he was not that day in funds, but he would
      draw on New York, and he sat down and wrote to the contractors in that
      city a glowing letter about the prospects of the road, and asked them to
      advance a hundred or two, until he got at work. No reply came. He wrote
      again, in an unoffended business like tone, suggesting that he had better
      draw at three days. A short answer came to this, simply saying that money
      was very tight in Wall street just then, and that he had better join the
      engineer corps as soon as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the bill had to be paid, and Harry took it to Philip, and asked him if
      he thought he hadn&rsquo;t better draw on his uncle. Philip had not much faith
      in Harry&rsquo;s power of &ldquo;drawing,&rdquo; and told him that he would pay the bill
      himself. Whereupon Harry dismissed the matter then and thereafter from his
      thoughts, and, like a light-hearted good fellow as he was, gave himself no
      more trouble about his board-bills. Philip paid them, swollen as they were
      with a monstrous list of extras; but he seriously counted the diminishing
      bulk of his own hoard, which was all the money he had in the world. Had he
      not tacitly agreed to share with Harry to the last in this adventure, and
      would not the generous fellow divide with him if he, Philip, were in want
      and Harry had anything?
    </p>
    <p>
      The fever at length got tired of tormenting the stout young engineer, who
      lay sick at the hotel, and left him, very thin, a little sallow but an
      &ldquo;acclimated&rdquo; man. Everybody said he was &ldquo;acclimated&rdquo; now, and said it
      cheerfully. What it is to be acclimated to western fevers no two persons
      exactly agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some say it is a sort of vaccination that renders death by some malignant
      type of fever less probable. Some regard it as a sort of initiation, like
      that into the Odd Fellows, which renders one liable to his regular dues
      thereafter. Others consider it merely the acquisition of a habit of taking
      every morning before breakfast a dose of bitters, composed of whiskey and
      assafoetida, out of the acclimation jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeff Thompson afterwards told Philip that he once asked Senator Atchison,
      then acting Vice-President of the United States, about the possibility of
      acclimation; he thought the opinion of the second officer of our great
      government would be valuable on this point. They were sitting together on
      a bench before a country tavern, in the free converse permitted by our
      democratic habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, Senator, that you have become acclimated to this country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p154" id="p154"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p154.jpg (20K)" src="images/p154.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Vice-President, crossing his legs, pulling his wide-awake
      down over his forehead, causing a passing chicken to hop quickly one side
      by the accuracy of his aim, and speaking with senatorial deliberation, &ldquo;I
      think I have. I&rsquo;ve been here twenty-five years, and dash, dash my dash to
      dash, if I haven&rsquo;t entertained twenty-five separate and distinct
      earthquakes, one a year. The niggro is the only person who can stand the
      fever and ague of this region.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The convalescence of the engineer was the signal for breaking up quarters
      at St. Louis, and the young fortune-hunters started up the river in good
      spirits. It was only the second time either of them had been upon a
      Mississippi steamboat, and nearly everything they saw had the charm of
      novelty. Col. Sellers was at the landing to bid them good-bye.

    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall send you up that basket of champagne by the next boat; no, no; no
      thanks; you&rsquo;ll find it not bad in camp,&rdquo; he cried out as the plank was
      hauled in. &ldquo;My respects to Thompson. Tell him to sight for Stone&rsquo;s. Let me
      know, Mr. Brierly, when you are ready to locate; I&rsquo;ll come over from
      Hawkeye. Goodbye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the last the young fellows saw of the Colonel, he was waving his hat,
      and beaming prosperity and good luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voyage was delightful, and was not long enough to become monotonous.
      The travelers scarcely had time indeed to get accustomed to the splendors
      of the great saloon where the tables were spread for meals, a marvel of
      paint and gilding, its ceiling hung with fancifully cut tissue-paper of
      many colors, festooned and arranged in endless patterns. The whole was
      more beautiful than a barber&rsquo;s shop. The printed bill of fare at dinner
      was longer and more varied, the proprietors justly boasted, than that of
      any hotel in New York. It must have been the work of an author of talent
      and imagination, and it surely was not his fault if the dinner itself was
      to a certain extent a delusion, and if the guests got something that
      tasted pretty much the same whatever dish they ordered; nor was it his
      fault if a general flavor of rose in all the dessert dishes suggested that
      they had passed through the barber&rsquo;s saloon on their way from the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The travelers landed at a little settlement on the left bank, and at once
      took horses for the camp in the interior, carrying their clothes and
      blankets strapped behind the saddles. Harry was dressed as we have seen
      him once before, and his long and shining boots attracted not a little the
      attention of the few persons they met on the road, and especially of the
      bright faced wenches who lightly stepped along the highway, picturesque in
      their colored kerchiefs, carrying light baskets, or riding upon mules and
      balancing before them a heavier load.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry sang fragments of operas and talked about their fortune. Philip even
      was excited by the sense of freedom and adventure, and the beauty of the
      landscape. The prairie, with its new grass and unending acres of brilliant
      flowers&mdash;chiefly the innumerable varieties of phlox&mdash;bore the
      look of years of cultivation, and the occasional open groves of white oaks
      gave it a park-like appearance. It was hardly unreasonable to expect to
      see at any moment, the gables and square windows of an Elizabethan mansion
      in one of the well kept groves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards sunset of the third day, when the young gentlemen thought they
      ought to be near the town of Magnolia, near which they had been directed
      to find the engineers&rsquo; camp, they descried a log house and drew up before
      it to enquire the way. Half the building was store, and half was dwelling
      house. At the door of the latter stood a negress with a bright turban on
      her head, to whom Philip called,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell me, auntie, how far it is to the town of Magnolia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, bress you chile,&rdquo; laughed the woman, &ldquo;you&rsquo;s dere now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p157" id="p157"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p157.jpg (84K)" src="images/p157.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was true. This log house was the compactly built town, and all creation
      was its suburbs. The engineers&rsquo; camp was only two or three miles distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;s boun&rsquo; to find it,&rdquo; directed auntie, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t keah nuffin &lsquo;bout
      de road, and go fo&rsquo; de sun-down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A brisk gallop brought the riders in sight of the twinkling light of the
      camp, just as the stars came out. It lay in a little hollow, where a small
      stream ran through a sparse grove of young white oaks. A half dozen tents
      were pitched under the trees, horses and oxen were corraled at a little
      distance, and a group of men sat on camp stools or lay on blankets about a
      bright fire. The twang of a banjo became audible as they drew nearer, and
      they saw a couple of negroes, from some neighboring plantation, &ldquo;breaking
      down&rdquo; a juba in approved style, amid the &ldquo;hi, hi&rsquo;s&rdquo; of the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jeff Thompson, for it was the camp of this redoubtable engineer, gave
      the travelers a hearty welcome, offered them ground room in his own tent,
      ordered supper, and set out a small jug, a drop from which he declared
      necessary on account of the chill of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p157b" id="p157b"></a>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw an Eastern man,&rdquo; said Jeff, &ldquo;who knew how to drink from a jug
      with one hand. It&rsquo;s as easy as lying. So.&rdquo; He grasped the handle with the
      right hand, threw the jug back upon his arm, and applied his lips to the
      nozzle. It was an act as graceful as it was simple. &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Thompson, setting it down, &ldquo;it puts every man on his honor as to
      quantity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Early to turn in was the rule of the camp, and by nine o&rsquo;clock everybody
      was under his blanket, except Jeff himself, who worked awhile at his table
      over his field-book, and then arose, stepped outside the tent door and
      sang, in a strong and not unmelodious tenor, the Star Spangled Banner from
      beginning to end. It proved to be his nightly practice to let off the
      unexpended steam of his conversational powers, in the words of this
      stirring song.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long time before Philip got to sleep. He saw the fire light, he
      saw the clear stars through the tree-tops, he heard the gurgle of the
      stream, the stamp of the horses, the occasional barking of the dog which
      followed the cook&rsquo;s wagon, the hooting of an owl; and when these failed he
      saw Jeff, standing on a battlement, mid the rocket&rsquo;s red glare, and heard
      him sing, &ldquo;Oh, say, can you see?&rdquo; It was the first time he had ever slept
      on the ground.

      Nobody dressed more like an engineer than Mr. Henry Brierly. The
      completeness of his appointments was the envy of the corps, and the gay
      fellow himself was the admiration of the camp servants, axemen, teamsters
      and cooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you didn&rsquo;t git them boots no wher&rsquo;s this side o&rsquo; Sent Louis?&rdquo;
       queried the tall Missouri youth who acted as commissary&rsquo;s assistant.

      &ldquo;No, New York.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Yas, I&rsquo;ve heern o&rsquo; New York,&rdquo; continued the butternut lad, attentively
      studying each item of Harry&rsquo;s dress, and endeavoring to cover his design
      with interesting conversation. &ldquo;&lsquo;N there&rsquo;s Massachusetts.&rdquo;,
    </p>

      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far off.&rdquo;

    <p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Abolish&rsquo;n wan&rsquo;t it? They must a cost right smart,&rdquo; referring to the
      boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry shouldered his rod and went to the field, tramped over the prairie
      by day, and figured up results at night, with the utmost cheerfulness and
      industry, and plotted the line on the profile paper, without, however, the
      least idea of engineering practical or theoretical. Perhaps there was not
      a great deal of scientific knowledge in the entire corps, nor was very
      much needed. They were making, what is called a preliminary survey, and
      the chief object of a preliminary survey was to get up an excitement about
      the road, to interest every town in that part of the state in it, under
      the belief that the road would run through it, and to get the aid of every
      planter upon the prospect that a station would be on his land.
    </p>

      Mr. Jeff Thompson was the most popular engineer who could be found for
      this work. He did not bother himself much about details or
      practicabilities of location, but ran merrily along, sighting from the top
      of one divide to the top of another, and striking &ldquo;plumb&rdquo; every town site
      and big plantation within twenty or thirty miles of his route. In his own
      language he &ldquo;just went booming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This course gave Harry an opportunity, as he said, to learn the practical
      details of engineering, and it gave Philip a chance to see the country,
      and to judge for himself what prospect of a fortune it offered. Both he
      and Harry got the &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; of more than one plantation as they went
      along, and wrote urgent letters to their eastern correspondents, upon the
      beauty of the land and the certainty that it would quadruple in value as
      soon as the road was finally located. It seemed strange to them that
      capitalists did not flock out there and secure this land.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not been in the field over two weeks when Harry wrote to his
      friend Col. Sellers that he&rsquo;d better be on the move, for the line was
      certain to go to Stone&rsquo;s Landing. Any one who looked at the line on the
      map, as it was laid down from day to day, would have been uncertain which
      way it was going; but Jeff had declared that in his judgment the only
      practicable route from the point they then stood on was to follow the
      divide to Stone&rsquo;s Landing, and it was generally understood that that town
      would be the next one hit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it, boys,&rdquo; said the chief, &ldquo;if we have to go in a balloon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And make it they did. In less than a week, this indomitable engineer had
      carried his moving caravan over slues and branches, across bottoms and
      along divides, and pitched his tents in the very heart of the city of
      Stone&rsquo;s Landing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be dashed,&rdquo; was heard the cheery voice of Mr. Thompson, as he
      stepped outside the tent door at sunrise next morning. &ldquo;If this don&rsquo;t get
      me. I say, yon Grayson, get out your sighting iron and see if you can find
      old Sellers&rsquo; town. Blame me if we wouldn&rsquo;t have run plumb by it if
      twilight had held on a little longer. Oh! Sterling, Brierly, get up and
      see the city. There&rsquo;s a steamboat just coming round the bend.&rdquo; And Jeff
      roared with laughter. &ldquo;The mayor&rsquo;ll be round here to breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p162" id="p162"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p162.jpg (87K)" src="images/p162.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellows turned out of the tents, rubbing their eyes, and stared about
      them. They were camped on the second bench of the narrow bottom of a
      crooked, sluggish stream, that was some five rods wide in the present good
      stage of water. Before them were a dozen log cabins, with stick and mud
      chimneys, irregularly disposed on either side of a not very well defined
      road, which did not seem to know its own mind exactly, and, after
      straggling through the town, wandered off over the rolling prairie in an
      uncertain way, as if it had started for nowhere and was quite likely to
      reach its destination. Just as it left the town, however, it was cheered
      and assisted by a guide-board, upon which was the legend &ldquo;10 Mils to
      Hawkeye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The road had never been made except by the travel over it, and at this
      season&mdash;the rainy June&mdash;it was a way of ruts cut in the black
      soil, and of fathomless mud-holes. In the principal street of the city, it
      had received more attention; for hogs, great and small, rooted about in it
      and wallowed in it, turning the street into a liquid quagmire which could
      only be crossed on pieces of plank thrown here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the chief cabin, which was the store and grocery of this mart of
      trade, the mud was more liquid than elsewhere, and the rude platform in
      front of it and the dry-goods boxes mounted thereon were places of refuge
      for all the loafers of the place. Down by the stream was a dilapidated
      building which served for a hemp warehouse, and a shaky wharf extended out
      from it, into the water. In fact a flat-boat was there moored by it, it&rsquo;s
      setting poles lying across the gunwales. Above the town the stream was
      crossed by a crazy wooden bridge, the supports of which leaned all ways in
      the soggy soil; the absence of a plank here and there in the flooring made
      the crossing of the bridge faster than a walk an offense not necessary to
      be prohibited by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Jeff, &ldquo;is Columbus River, alias Goose Run. If it
      was widened, and deepened, and straightened, and made, long enough, it
      would be one of the finest rivers in the western country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the sun rose and sent his level beams along the stream, the thin
      stratum of mist, or malaria, rose also and dispersed, but the light was
      not able to enliven the dull water nor give any hint of its apparently
      fathomless depth. Venerable mud-turtles crawled up and roosted upon the
      old logs in the stream, their backs glistening in the sun, the first
      inhabitants of the metropolis to begin the active business of the day.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long, however, before smoke began to issue from the city
      chimneys; and before the engineers had finished their breakfast they were
      the object of the curious inspection of six or eight boys and men, who
      lounged into the camp and gazed about them with languid interest, their
      hands in their pockets every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning; gentlemen,&rdquo; called out the chief engineer, from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good mawning,&rdquo; drawled out the spokesman of the party. &ldquo;I allow
      thish-yers the railroad, I heern it was a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this is the railroad; all but the rails and the ironhorse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you kin git all the rails you want oaten my white oak timber
      over, thar,&rdquo; replied the first speaker, who appeared to be a man of
      property and willing to strike up a trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to negotiate with the contractors about the rails, sir,&rdquo; said
      Jeff; &ldquo;here&rsquo;s Mr. Brierly, I&rsquo;ve no doubt would like to buy your rails when
      the time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;I thought maybe you&rsquo;d fetch the whole bilin along with
      you. But if you want rails, I&rsquo;ve got em, haint I Eph.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaps,&rdquo; said Eph, without taking his eyes off the group at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Thompson, rising from his seat and moving towards his
      tent, &ldquo;the railroad has come to Stone&rsquo;s Landing, sure; I move we take a
      drink on it all round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The proposal met with universal favor. Jeff gave prosperity to Stone&rsquo;s
      Landing and navigation to Goose Run, and the toast was washed down with
      gusto, in the simple fluid of corn; and with the return compliment that a
      rail road was a good thing, and that Jeff Thompson was no slouch.
    </p>
    <p>
      About ten o&rsquo;clock a horse and wagon was descried making a slow approach to
      the camp over the prairie. As it drew near, the wagon was seen to contain
      a portly gentleman, who hitched impatiently forward on his seat, shook the
      reins and gently touched up his horse, in the vain attempt to communicate
      his own energy to that dull beast, and looked eagerly at the tents. When
      the conveyance at length drew up to Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s door, the gentleman
      descended with great deliberation, straightened himself up, rubbed his
      hands, and beaming satisfaction from every part of his radiant frame,
      advanced to the group that was gathered to welcome him, and which had
      saluted him by name as soon as he came within hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome to Napoleon, gentlemen, welcome. I am proud to see you here Mr.
      Thompson. You are, looking well Mr. Sterling. This is the country, sir.
      Right glad to see you Mr. Brierly. You got that basket of champagne? No?
      Those blasted river thieves! I&rsquo;ll never send anything more by &lsquo;em. The
      best brand, Roederer. The last I had in my cellar, from a lot sent me by
      Sir George Gore&mdash;took him out on a buffalo hunt, when he visited our
      country. Is always sending me some trifle. You haven&rsquo;t looked about any
      yet, gentlemen? It&rsquo;s in the rough yet, in the rough. Those buildings will
      all have to come down. That&rsquo;s the place for the public square, Court
      House, hotels, churches, jail&mdash;all that sort of thing. About where we
      stand, the deepo. How does that strike your engineering eye, Mr. Thompson?
      Down yonder the business streets, running to the wharves. The University
      up there, on rising ground, sightly place, see the river for miles. That&rsquo;s
      Columbus river, only forty-nine miles to the Missouri. You see what it is,
      placid, steady, no current to interfere with navigation, wants widening in
      places and dredging, dredge out the harbor and raise a levee in front of
      the town; made by nature on purpose for a mart. Look at all this country,
      not another building within ten miles, no other navigable stream, lay of
      the land points right here; hemp, tobacco, corn, must come here. The
      railroad will do it, Napoleon won&rsquo;t know itself in a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t now evidently,&rdquo; said Philip aside to Harry. &ldquo;Have you breakfasted
      Colonel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hastily. Cup of coffee. Can&rsquo;t trust any coffee I don&rsquo;t import myself. But
      I put up a basket of provisions,&mdash;wife would put in a few delicacies,
      women always will, and a half dozen of that Burgundy, I was telling you of
      Mr. Briefly. By the way, you never got to dine with me.&rdquo; And the Colonel
      strode away to the wagon and looked under the seat for the basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p165" id="p165"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p165.jpg (52K)" src="images/p165.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently it was not there. For the Colonel raised up the flap, looked in
      front and behind, and then exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it. That comes of not doing a thing yourself. I trusted to the
      women folks to set that basket in the wagon, and it ain&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The camp cook speedily prepared a savory breakfast for the Colonel,
      broiled chicken, eggs, corn-bread, and coffee, to which he did ample
      justice, and topped off with a drop of Old Bourbon, from Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s
      private store, a brand which he said he knew well, he should think it came
      from his own sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the engineer corps went to the field, to run back a couple of miles
      and ascertain, approximately, if a road could ever get down to the
      Landing, and to sight ahead across the Run, and see if it could ever get
      out again, Col. Sellers and Harry sat down and began to roughly map out
      the city of Napoleon on a large piece of drawing paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the refusal of a mile square here,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;in our
      names, for a year, with a quarter interest reserved for the four owners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They laid out the town liberally, not lacking room, leaving space for the
      railroad to come in, and for the river as it was to be when improved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engineers reported that the railroad could come in, by taking a little
      sweep and crossing the stream on a high bridge, but the grades would be
      steep. Col. Sellers said he didn&rsquo;t care so much about the grades, if the
      road could only be made to reach the elevators on the river. The next day
      Mr. Thompson made a hasty survey of the stream for a mile or two, so that
      the Colonel and Harry were enabled to show on their map how nobly that
      would accommodate the city. Jeff took a little writing from the Colonel
      and Harry for a prospective share but Philip declined to join in, saying
      that he had no money, and didn&rsquo;t want to make engagements he couldn&rsquo;t
      fulfill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the camp moved on, followed till it was out of sight by
      the listless eyes of the group in front of the store, one of whom remarked
      that, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d be doggoned if he ever expected to see that railroad any mo&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry went with the Colonel to Hawkeye to complete their arrangements, a
      part of which was the preparation of a petition to congress for the
      improvement of the navigation of Columbus River.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight years have passed since the death of Mr. Hawkins. Eight years are
      not many in the life of a nation or the history of a state, but they may
      be years of destiny that shall fix the current of the century following.
      Such years were those that followed the little scrimmage on Lexington
      Common. Such years were those that followed the double-shotted demand for
      the surrender of Fort Sumter. History is never done with inquiring of
      these years, and summoning witnesses about them, and trying to understand
      their significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eight years in America from 1860 to 1868 uprooted institutions that
      were centuries old, changed the politics of a people, transformed the
      social life of half the country, and wrought so profoundly upon the entire
      national character that the influence cannot be measured short of two or
      three generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we are accustomed to interpret the economy of providence, the life of
      the individual is as nothing to that of the nation or the race; but who
      can say, in the broader view and the more intelligent weight of values,
      that the life of one man is not more than that of a nationality, and that
      there is not a tribunal where the tragedy of one human soul shall not seem
      more significant than the overturning of any human institution whatever?
    </p>
    <p>
      When one thinks of the tremendous forces of the upper and the nether world
      which play for the mastery of the soul of a woman during the few years in
      which she passes from plastic girlhood to the ripe maturity of womanhood,
      he may well stand in awe before the momentous drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      What capacities she has of purity, tenderness, goodness; what capacities
      of vileness, bitterness and evil. Nature must needs be lavish with the
      mother and creator of men, and centre in her all the possibilities of
      life. And a few critical years can decide whether her life is to be full
      of sweetness and light, whether she is to be the vestal of a holy temple,
      or whether she will be the fallen priestess of a desecrated shrine. There
      are women, it is true, who seem to be capable neither of rising much nor
      of falling much, and whom a conventional life saves from any special
      development of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Laura was not one of them. She had the fatal gift of beauty, and that
      more fatal gift which does not always accompany mere beauty, the power of
      fascination, a power that may, indeed, exist without beauty. She had will,
      and pride and courage and ambition, and she was left to be very much her
      own guide at the age when romance comes to the aid of passion, and when
      the awakening powers of her vigorous mind had little object on which to
      discipline themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tremendous conflict that was fought in this girl&rsquo;s soul none of those
      about her knew, and very few knew that her life had in it anything unusual
      or romantic or strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were troublous days in Hawkeye as well as in most other Missouri
      towns, days of confusion, when between Unionist and Confederate
      occupations, sudden maraudings and bush-whackings and raids, individuals
      escaped observation or comment in actions that would have filled the town
      with scandal in quiet times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately we only need to deal with Laura&rsquo;s life at this period
      historically, and look back upon such portions of it as will serve to
      reveal the woman as she was at the time of the arrival of Mr. Harry
      Brierly in Hawkeye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hawkins family were settled there, and had a hard enough struggle with
      poverty and the necessity of keeping up appearances in accord with their
      own family pride and the large expectations they secretly cherished of a
      fortune in the Knobs of East Tennessee. How pinched they were perhaps no
      one knew but Clay, to whom they looked for almost their whole support.
      Washington had been in Hawkeye off and on, attracted away occasionally by
      some tremendous speculation, from which he invariably returned to Gen.
      Boswell&rsquo;s office as poor as he went. He was the inventor of no one knew
      how many useless contrivances, which were not worth patenting, and his
      years had been passed in dreaming and planning to no purpose; until he was
      now a man of about thirty, without a profession or a permanent occupation,
      a tall, brown-haired, dreamy person of the best intentions and the
      frailest resolution. Probably however the eight years had been happier to
      him than to any others in his circle, for the time had been mostly spent
      in a blissful dream of the coming of enormous wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out with a company from Hawkeye to the war, and was not wanting in
      courage, but he would have been a better soldier if he had been less
      engaged in contrivances for circumventing the enemy by strategy unknown to
      the books.

    <p>
      It happened to him to be captured in one of his self-appointed
      expeditions, but the federal colonel released him, after a short
      examination, satisfied that he could most injure the confederate forces
      opposed to the Unionists by returning him to his regiment. Col. Sellers
      was of course a prominent man during the war. He was captain of the home
      guards in Hawkeye, and he never left home except upon one occasion, when
      on the strength of a rumor, he executed a flank movement and fortified
      Stone&rsquo;s Landing, a place which no one unacquainted with the country would
      be likely to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad,&rdquo; said the Colonel afterwards, &ldquo;the Landing is the key to upper
      Missouri, and it is the only place the enemy never captured. If other
      places had been defended as well as that was, the result would have been
      different, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel had his own theories about war as he had in other things. If
      everybody had stayed at home as he did, he said, the South never would
      have been conquered. For what would there have been to conquer? Mr. Jeff
      Davis was constantly writing him to take command of a corps in the
      confederate army, but Col. Sellers said, no, his duty was at home. And he
      was by no means idle. He was the inventor of the famous air torpedo, which
      came very near destroying the Union armies in Missouri, and the city of
      St. Louis itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      His plan was to fill a torpedo with Greek fire and poisonous and deadly
      missiles, attach it to a balloon, and then let it sail away over the
      hostile camp and explode at the right moment, when the time-fuse burned
      out. He intended to use this invention in the capture of St. Louis,
      exploding his torpedoes over the city, and raining destruction upon it
      until the army of occupation would gladly capitulate. He was unable to
      procure the Greek fire, but he constructed a vicious torpedo which would
      have answered the purpose, but the first one prematurely exploded in his
      wood-house, blowing it clean away, and setting fire to his house. The
      neighbors helped him put out the conflagration, but they discouraged any
      more experiments of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patriotic old gentleman, however, planted so much powder and so many
      explosive contrivances in the roads leading into Hawkeye, and then forgot
      the exact spots of danger, that people were afraid to travel the highways,
      and used to come to town across the fields. The Colonel&rsquo;s motto was,
      &ldquo;Millions for defence but not one cent for tribute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Laura came to Hawkeye she might have forgotten the annoyances of the
      gossips of Murpheysburg and have out lived the bitterness that was growing
      in her heart, if she had been thrown less upon herself, or if the
      surroundings of her life had been more congenial and helpful. But she had
      little society, less and less as she grew older that was congenial to her,
      and her mind preyed upon itself; and the mystery of her birth at once
      chagrined her and raised in her the most extravagant expectations. She was
      proud and she felt the sting of poverty. She could not but be conscious of
      her beauty also, and she was vain of that, and came to take a sort of
      delight in the exercise of her fascinations upon the rather loutish young
      men who came in her way and whom she despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another world opened to her&mdash;a world of books. But it was
      not the best world of that sort, for the small libraries she had access to
      in Hawkeye were decidedly miscellaneous, and largely made up of romances
      and fictions which fed her imagination with the most exaggerated notions
      of life, and showed her men and women in a very false sort of heroism.
      From these stories she learned what a woman of keen intellect and some
      culture joined to beauty and fascination of manner, might expect to
      accomplish in society as she read of it; and along with these ideas she
      imbibed other very crude ones in regard to the emancipation of woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also other books&mdash;histories, biographies of distinguished
      people, travels in far lands, poems, especially those of Byron, Scott and
      Shelley and Moore, which she eagerly absorbed, and appropriated therefrom
      what was to her liking. Nobody in Hawkeye had read so much or, after a
      fashion, studied so diligently as Laura. She passed for an accomplished
      girl, and no doubt thought herself one, as she was, judged by any standard
      near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the war there came to Hawkeye a confederate officer, Col. Selby,
      who was stationed there for a time, in command of that district. He was a
      handsome, soldierly man of thirty years, a graduate of the University of
      Virginia, and of distinguished family, if his story might be believed,
      and, it was evident, a man of the world and of extensive travel and
      adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find in such an out of the way country place a woman like Laura was a
      piece of good luck upon which Col. Selby congratulated himself. He was
      studiously polite to her and treated her with a consideration to which she
      was unaccustomed. She had read of such men, but she had never seen one
      before, one so high-bred, so noble in sentiment, so entertaining in
      conversation, so engaging in manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a long story; unfortunately it is an old story, and it need not be
      dwelt on. Laura loved him, and believed that his love for her was as pure
      and deep as her own. She worshipped him and would have counted her life a
      little thing to give him, if he would only love her and let her feed the
      hunger of her heart upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passion possessed her whole being, and lifted her up, till she seemed
      to walk on air. It was all true, then, the romances she had read, the
      bliss of love she had dreamed of. Why had she never noticed before how
      blithesome the world was, how jocund with love; the birds sang it, the
      trees whispered it to her as she passed, the very flowers beneath her feet
      strewed the way as for a bridal march.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Colonel went away they were engaged to be married, as soon as he
      could make certain arrangements which he represented to be necessary, and
      quit the army. He wrote to her from Harding, a small town in the southwest
      corner of the state, saying that he should be held in the service longer
      than he had expected, but that it would not be more than a few months,
      then he should be at liberty to take her to Chicago where he had property,
      and should have business, either now or as soon as the war was over, which
      he thought could not last long. Meantime why should they be separated? He
      was established in comfortable quarters, and if she could find company and
      join him, they would be married, and gain so many more months of
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was woman ever prudent when she loved? Laura went to Harding, the
      neighbors supposed to nurse Washington who had fallen ill there. Her
      engagement was, of course, known in Hawkeye, and was indeed a matter of
      pride to her family. Mrs. Hawkins would have told the first inquirer that.
      Laura had gone to be married; but Laura had cautioned her; she did not
      want to be thought of, she said, as going in search of a husband; let the
      news come back after she was married.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she traveled to Harding on the pretence we have mentioned, and was
      married. She was married, but something must have happened on that very
      day or the next that alarmed her. Washington did not know then or after
      what it was, but Laura bound him not to send news of her marriage to
      Hawkeye yet, and to enjoin her mother not to speak of it. Whatever cruel
      suspicion or nameless dread this was, Laura tried bravely to put it away,
      and not let it cloud her happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communication that summer, as may be imagined, was neither regular nor
      frequent between the remote confederate camp at Harding and Hawkeye, and
      Laura was in a measure lost sight of&mdash;indeed, everyone had troubles
      enough of his own without borrowing from his neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had given herself utterly to her husband, and if he had faults, if
      he was selfish, if he was sometimes coarse, if he was dissipated, she did
      not or would not see it. It was the passion of her life, the time when her
      whole nature went to flood tide and swept away all barriers. Was her
      husband ever cold or indifferent? She shut her eyes to everything but her
      sense of possession of her idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three months passed. One morning her husband informed her that he had been
      ordered South, and must go within two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can be ready,&rdquo; said Laura, cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t take you. You must go back to Hawkeye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t-take-me?&rdquo; Laura asked, with wonder in her eyes. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t live
      without you. You said&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O bother what I said,&rdquo;&mdash;and the Colonel took up his sword to buckle
      it on, and then continued coolly, &ldquo;the fact is Laura, our romance is
      played out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura heard, but she did not comprehend. She caught his arm and cried,
      &ldquo;George, how can you joke so cruelly? I will go any where with you. I will
      wait any where. I can&rsquo;t go back to Hawkeye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go where you like. Perhaps,&rdquo; continued he with a sneer, &ldquo;you would
      do as well to wait here, for another colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s brain whirled. She did not yet comprehend. &ldquo;What does this mean?
      Where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said the officer, in measured words, &ldquo;that you haven&rsquo;t
      anything to show for a legal marriage, and that I am going to New
      Orleans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie, George, it&rsquo;s a lie. I am your wife. I shall go. I shall
      follow you to New Orleans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps my wife might not like it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura raised her head, her eyes flamed with fire, she tried to utter a
      cry, and fell senseless on the floor.

      When she came to herself the Colonel was gone. Washington Hawkins stood at
      her bedside. Did she come to herself? Was there anything left in her heart
      but hate and bitterness, a sense of an infamous wrong at the hands of the
      only man she had ever loved?
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to Hawkeye. With the exception of Washington and his mother,
      no one knew what had happened. The neighbors supposed that the engagement
      with Col. Selby had fallen through. Laura was ill for a long time, but she
      recovered; she had that resolution in her that could conquer death almost.
      And with her health came back her beauty, and an added fascination, a
      something that might be mistaken for sadness. Is there a beauty in the
      knowledge of evil, a beauty that shines out in the face of a person whose
      inward life is transformed by some terrible experience? Is the pathos in
      the eyes of the Beatrice Cenci from her guilt or her innocence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura was not much changed. The lovely woman had a devil in her heart.
      That was all.

      <a name="ch19" id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Harry Brierly drew his pay as an engineer while he was living at the
      City Hotel in Hawkeye. Mr. Thompson had been kind enough to say that it
      didn&rsquo;t make any difference whether he was with the corps or not; and
      although Harry protested to the Colonel daily and to Washington Hawkins
      that he must go back at once to the line and superintend the lay-out with
      reference to his contract, yet he did not go, but wrote instead long
      letters to Philip, instructing him to keep his eye out, and to let him
      know when any difficulty occurred that required his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime Harry blossomed out in the society of Hawkeye, as he did in any
      society where fortune cast him and he had the slightest opportunity to
      expand. Indeed the talents of a rich and accomplished young fellow like
      Harry were not likely to go unappreciated in such a place. A land
      operator, engaged in vast speculations, a favorite in the select circles
      of New York, in correspondence with brokers and bankers, intimate with
      public men at Washington, one who could play the guitar and touch the
      banjo lightly, and who had an eye for a pretty girl, and knew the language
      of flattery, was welcome everywhere in Hawkeye. Even Miss Laura Hawkins
      thought it worth while to use her fascinations upon him, and to endeavor
      to entangle the volatile fellow in the meshes of her attractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gad,&rdquo; says Harry to the Colonel, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s a superb creature, she&rsquo;d make a
      stir in New York, money or no money. There are men I know would give her a
      railroad or an opera house, or whatever she wanted&mdash;at least they&rsquo;d
      promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry had a way of looking at women as he looked at anything else in the
      world he wanted, and he half resolved to appropriate Miss Laura, during
      his stay in Hawkeye. Perhaps the Colonel divined his thoughts, or was
      offended at Harry&rsquo;s talk, for he replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No nonsense, Mr. Brierly. Nonsense won&rsquo;t do in Hawkeye, not with my
      friends. The Hawkins&rsquo; blood is good blood, all the way from Tennessee. The
      Hawkinses are under the weather now, but their Tennessee property is
      millions when it comes into market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Colonel. Not the least offense intended. But you can see she
      is a fascinating woman. I was only thinking, as to this appropriation,
      now, what such a woman could do in Washington. All correct, too, all
      correct. Common thing, I assure you in Washington; the wives of senators,
      representatives, cabinet officers, all sorts of wives, and some who are
      not wives, use their influence. You want an appointment? Do you go to
      Senator X? Not much. You get on the right side of his wife. Is it an
      appropriation? You&rsquo;d go straight to the Committee, or to the Interior
      office, I suppose? You&rsquo;d learn better than that. It takes a woman to get
      any thing through the Land Office: I tell you, Miss Laura would fascinate
      an appropriation right through the Senate and the House of Representatives
      in one session, if she was in Washington, as your friend, Colonel, of
      course as your friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have her sign our petition?&rdquo; asked the Colonel, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry laughed. &ldquo;Women don&rsquo;t get anything by petitioning Congress; nobody
      does, that&rsquo;s for form. Petitions are referred somewhere, and that&rsquo;s the
      last of them; you can&rsquo;t refer a handsome woman so easily, when she is
      present. They prefer &lsquo;em mostly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p179" id="p179"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p179.jpg (41K)" src="images/p179.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The petition however was elaborately drawn up, with a glowing description
      of Napoleon and the adjacent country, and a statement of the absolute
      necessity to the prosperity of that region and of one of the stations on
      the great through route to the Pacific, of the immediate improvement of
      Columbus River; to this was appended a map of the city and a survey of the
      river. It was signed by all the people at Stone&rsquo;s Landing who could write
      their names, by Col. Beriah Sellers, and the Colonel agreed to have the
      names headed by all the senators and representatives from the state and by
      a sprinkling of ex-governors and ex-members of congress. When completed it
      was a formidable document. Its preparation and that of more minute plots
      of the new city consumed the valuable time of Sellers and Harry for many
      weeks, and served to keep them both in the highest spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the eyes of Washington Hawkins, Harry was a superior being, a man who
      was able to bring things to pass in a way that excited his enthusiasm. He
      never tired of listening to his stories of what he had done and of what he
      was going to do. As for Washington, Harry thought he was a man of ability
      and comprehension, but &ldquo;too visionary,&rdquo; he told the Colonel. The Colonel
      said he might be right, but he had never noticed anything visionary about
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got his plans, sir. God bless my soul, at his age, I was full of
      plans. But experience sobers a man, I never touch any thing now that
      hasn&rsquo;t been weighed in my judgment; and when Beriah Sellers puts his
      judgment on a thing, there it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might have been Harry&rsquo;s intentions with regard to Laura, he saw
      more and more of her every day, until he got to be restless and nervous
      when he was not with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That consummate artist in passion allowed him to believe that the
      fascination was mainly on his side, and so worked upon his vanity, while
      inflaming his ardor, that he scarcely knew what he was about. Her coolness
      and coyness were even made to appear the simple precautions of a modest
      timidity, and attracted him even more than the little tendernesses into
      which she was occasionally surprised. He could never be away from her
      long, day or evening; and in a short time their intimacy was the town
      talk. She played with him so adroitly that Harry thought she was absorbed
      in love for him, and yet he was amazed that he did not get on faster in
      his conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he thought of it, he was piqued as well. A country girl, poor
      enough, that was evident; living with her family in a cheap and most
      unattractive frame house, such as carpenters build in America, scantily
      furnished and unadorned; without the adventitious aids of dress or jewels
      or the fine manners of society&mdash;Harry couldn&rsquo;t understand it. But she
      fascinated him, and held him just beyond the line of absolute familiarity
      at the same time. While he was with her she made him forget that the
      Hawkins&rsquo; house was nothing but a wooden tenement, with four small square
      rooms on the ground floor and a half story; it might have been a palace
      for aught he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Laura was older than Harry. She was, at any rate, at that ripe age
      when beauty in woman seems more solid than in the budding period of
      girlhood, and she had come to understand her powers perfectly, and to know
      exactly how much of the susceptibility and archness of the girl it was
      profitable to retain. She saw that many women, with the best intentions,
      make a mistake of carrying too much girlishness into womanhood. Such a
      woman would have attracted Harry at any time, but only a woman with a cool
      brain and exquisite art could have made him lose his head in this way; for
      Harry thought himself a man of the world. The young fellow never dreamed
      that he was merely being experimented on; he was to her a man of another
      society and another culture, different from that she had any knowledge of
      except in books, and she was not unwilling to try on him the fascinations
      of her mind and person.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Laura had her dreams. She detested the narrow limits in which her lot
      was cast, she hated poverty. Much of her reading had been of modern works
      of fiction, written by her own sex, which had revealed to her something of
      her own powers and given her indeed, an exaggerated notion of the
      influence, the wealth, the position a woman may attain who has beauty and
      talent and ambition and a little culture, and is not too scrupulous in the
      use of them. She wanted to be rich, she wanted luxury, she wanted men at
      her feet, her slaves, and she had not&mdash;thanks to some of the novels
      she had read&mdash;the nicest discrimination between notoriety and
      reputation; perhaps she did not know how fatal notoriety usually is to the
      bloom of womanhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the other Hawkins children Laura had been brought up in the belief
      that they had inherited a fortune in the Tennessee Lands. She did not by
      any means share all the delusion of the family; but her brain was not
      seldom busy with schemes about it. Washington seemed to her only to dream
      of it and to be willing to wait for its riches to fall upon him in a
      golden shower; but she was impatient, and wished she were a man to take
      hold of the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You men must enjoy your schemes and your activity and liberty to go about
      the world,&rdquo; she said to Harry one day, when he had been talking of New
      York and Washington and his incessant engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied that martyr to business, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all well enough, if you
      don&rsquo;t have too much of it, but it only has one object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a woman doesn&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s useless to tell her. What do you suppose I
      am staying in Hawkeye for, week after week, when I ought to be with my
      corps?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s your business with Col. Sellers about Napoleon, you&rsquo;ve
      always told me so,&rdquo; answered Laura, with a look intended to contradict her
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I tell you that is all arranged, I suppose you&rsquo;ll tell me I ought
      to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry!&rdquo; exclaimed Laura, touching his arm and letting her pretty hand
      rest there a moment. &ldquo;Why should I want you to go away? The only person in
      Hawkeye who understands me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you refuse to understand me,&rdquo; replied Harry, flattered but still
      petulant. &ldquo;You are like an iceberg, when we are alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura looked up with wonder in her great eyes, and something like a blush
      suffusing her face, followed by a look of langour that penetrated Harry&rsquo;s
      heart as if it had been longing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I ever show any want of confidence in you, Harry?&rdquo; And she gave him
      her hand, which Harry pressed with effusion&mdash;something in her manner
      told him that he must be content with that favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was always so. She excited his hopes and denied him, inflamed his
      passion and restrained it, and wound him in her toils day by day. To what
      purpose? It was keen delight to Laura to prove that she had power over
      men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura liked to hear about life at the east, and especially about the
      luxurious society in which Mr. Brierly moved when he was at home. It
      pleased her imagination to fancy herself a queen in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should be a winter in Washington,&rdquo; Harry said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I have no acquaintances there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know any of the families of the congressmen? They like to have a
      pretty woman staying with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose Col. Sellers should, have business there; say, about this
      Columbus River appropriation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sellers!&rdquo; and Laura laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t laugh. Queerer things have happened. Sellers knows everybody
      from Missouri, and from the West, too, for that matter. He&rsquo;d introduce you
      to Washington life quick enough. It doesn&rsquo;t need a crowbar to break your
      way into society there as it does in Philadelphia. It&rsquo;s democratic,
      Washington is. Money or beauty will open any door. If I were a handsome
      woman, I shouldn&rsquo;t want any better place than the capital to pick up a
      prince or a fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Laura. &ldquo;But I prefer the quiet of home, and the love
      of those I know;&rdquo; and her face wore a look of sweet contentment and
      unworldliness that finished Mr. Harry Brierly for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the hint that Harry had dropped fell upon good ground, and
      bore fruit an hundred fold; it worked in her mind until she had built up a
      plan on it, and almost a career for herself. Why not, she said, why
      shouldn&rsquo;t I do as other women have done? She took the first opportunity to
      see Col. Sellers, and to sound him about the Washington visit. How was he
      getting on with his navigation scheme, would it be likely to take him from
      home to Jefferson City; or to Washington, perhaps?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe. If the people of Napoleon want me to go to Washington, and
      look after that matter, I might tear myself from my home. It&rsquo;s been
      suggested to me, but&mdash;not a word of it to Mrs. Sellers and the
      children. Maybe they wouldn&rsquo;t like to think of their father in Washington.
      But Dilworthy, Senator Dilworthy, says to me, &lsquo;Colonel, you are the man,
      you could influence more votes than any one else on such a measure, an old
      settler, a man of the people, you know the wants of Missouri; you&rsquo;ve a
      respect for religion too, says he, and know how the cause of the gospel
      goes with improvements: Which is true enough, Miss Laura, and hasn&rsquo;t been
      enough thought of in connection with Napoleon. He&rsquo;s an able man,
      Dilworthy, and a good man. A man has got to be good to succeed as he has.
      He&rsquo;s only been in Congress a few years, and he must be worth a million.
      First thing in the morning when he stayed with me he asked about family
      prayers, whether we had &lsquo;em before or after breakfast. I hated to
      disappoint the Senator, but I had to out with it, tell him we didn&rsquo;t have
      &lsquo;em, not steady. He said he understood, business interruptions and all
      that, some men were well enough without, but as for him he never neglected
      the ordinances of religion. He doubted if the Columbus River appropriation
      would succeed if we did not invoke the Divine Blessing on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it is unnecessary to say to the reader that Senator Dilworthy had
      not stayed with Col. Sellers while he was in Hawkeye; this visit to his
      house being only one of the Colonel&rsquo;s hallucinations&mdash;one of those
      instant creations of his fertile fancy, which were always flashing into
      his brain and out of his mouth in the course of any conversation and
      without interrupting the flow of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the summer Philip rode across the country and made a short visit in
      Hawkeye, giving Harry an opportunity to show him the progress that he and
      the Colonel had made in their operation at Stone&rsquo;s Landing, to introduce
      him also to Laura, and to borrow a little money when he departed. Harry
      bragged about his conquest, as was his habit, and took Philip round to see
      his western prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura received Mr. Philip with a courtesy and a slight hauteur that rather
      surprised and not a little interested him. He saw at once that she was
      older than Harry, and soon made up his mind that she was leading his
      friend a country dance to which he was unaccustomed. At least he thought
      he saw that, and half hinted as much to Harry, who flared up at once; but
      on a second visit Philip was not so sure, the young lady was certainly
      kind and friendly and almost confiding with Harry, and treated Philip with
      the greatest consideration. She deferred to his opinions, and listened
      attentively when he talked, and in time met his frank manner with an equal
      frankness, so that he was quite convinced that whatever she might feel
      towards Harry, she was sincere with him. Perhaps his manly way did win her
      liking. Perhaps in her mind, she compared him with Harry, and recognized
      in him a man to whom a woman might give her whole soul, recklessly and
      with little care if she lost it. Philip was not invincible to her beauty
      nor to the intellectual charm of her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The week seemed very short that he passed in Hawkeye, and when he bade
      Laura good by, he seemed to have known her a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see you again, Mr. Sterling,&rdquo; she said as she gave him her hand,
      with just a shade of sadness in her handsome eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he turned away she followed him with a look that might have
      disturbed his serenity, if he had not at the moment had a little square
      letter in his breast pocket, dated at Philadelphia, and signed &ldquo;Ruth.&rdquo;

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The visit of Senator Abner Dilworthy was an event in Hawkeye. When a
      Senator, whose place is in Washington moving among the Great and guiding
      the destinies of the nation, condescends to mingle among the people and
      accept the hospitalities of such a place as Hawkeye, the honor is not
      considered a light one. All parties are flattered by it and politics are
      forgotten in the presence of one so distinguished among his fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dilworthy, who was from a neighboring state, had been a Unionist
      in the darkest days of his country, and had thriven by it, but was that
      any reason why Col. Sellers, who had been a confederate and had not
      thriven by it, should give him the cold shoulder?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator was the guest of his old friend Gen. Boswell, but it almost
      appeared that he was indebted to Col. Sellers for the unreserved
      hospitalities of the town. It was the large hearted Colonel who, in a
      manner, gave him the freedom of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are known here, sir,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;and Hawkeye is proud of you.
      You will find every door open, and a welcome at every hearthstone. I
      should insist upon your going to my house, if you were not claimed by your
      older friend Gen. Boswell. But you will mingle with our people, and you
      will see here developments that will surprise you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel was so profuse in his hospitality that he must have made the
      impression upon himself that he had entertained the Senator at his own
      mansion during his stay; at any rate, he afterwards always spoke of him as
      his guest, and not seldom referred to the Senator&rsquo;s relish of certain
      viands on his table. He did, in fact, press him to dine upon the morning
      of the day the Senator was going away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dilworthy was large and portly, though not tall&mdash;a pleasant
      spoken man, a popular man with the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a lively interest in the town and all the surrounding country, and
      made many inquiries as to the progress of agriculture, of education, and
      of religion, and especially as to the condition of the emancipated race.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Providence,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has placed them in our hands, and although you and
      I, General, might have chosen a different destiny for them, under the
      Constitution, yet Providence knows best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do much with &lsquo;em,&rdquo; interrupted Col. Sellers. &ldquo;They are a
      speculating race, sir, disinclined to work for white folks without
      security, planning how to live by only working for themselves. Idle, sir,
      there&rsquo;s my garden just a ruin of weeds. Nothing practical in &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some truth in your observation, Colonel, but you must educate
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You educate the niggro and you make him more speculating than he was
      before. If he won&rsquo;t stick to any industry except for himself now, what
      will he do then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Colonel, the negro when educated will be more able to make his
      speculations fruitful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, sir, never. He would only have a wider scope to injure himself. A
      niggro has no grasp, sir. Now, a white man can conceive great operations,
      and carry them out; a niggro can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; replied the Senator, &ldquo;granting that he might injure himself in a
      worldly point of view, his elevation through education would multiply his
      chances for the hereafter&mdash;which is the important thing after all,
      Colonel. And no matter what the result is, we must fulfill our duty by
      this being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d elevate his soul,&rdquo; promptly responded the Colonel; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just it;
      you can&rsquo;t make his soul too immortal, but I wouldn&rsquo;t touch him, himself.
      Yes, sir! make his soul immortal, but don&rsquo;t disturb the niggro as he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course one of the entertainments offered the Senator was a public
      reception, held in the court house, at which he made a speech to his
      fellow citizens. Col. Sellers was master of ceremonies. He escorted the
      band from the city hotel to Gen. Boswell&rsquo;s; he marshalled the procession
      of Masons, of Odd Fellows, and of Firemen, the Good Templars, the Sons of
      Temperance, the Cadets of Temperance, the Daughters of Rebecca, the Sunday
      School children, and citizens generally, which followed the Senator to the
      court house; he bustled about the room long after every one else was
      seated, and loudly cried &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; in the dead silence which preceded the
      introduction of the Senator by Gen. Boswell. The occasion was one to call
      out his finest powers of personal appearance, and one he long dwelt on
      with pleasure.

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This not being an edition of the Congressional Globe it is impossible to
      give Senator Dilworthy&rsquo;s speech in full. He began somewhat as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fellow citizens: It gives me great pleasure to thus meet and mingle with
      you, to lay aside for a moment the heavy duties of an official and
      burdensome station, and confer in familiar converse with my friends in
      your great state. The good opinion of my fellow citizens of all sections
      is the sweetest solace in all my anxieties. I look forward with longing to
      the time when I can lay aside the cares of office&mdash;&rdquo; [&ldquo;dam sight,&rdquo;
       shouted a tipsy fellow near the door. Cries of &ldquo;put him out.&rdquo;]
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends, do not remove him. Let the misguided man stay. I see that he
      is a victim of that evil which is swallowing up public virtue and sapping
      the foundation of society. As I was saying, when I can lay down the cares
      of office and retire to the sweets of private life in some such sweet,
      peaceful, intelligent, wide-awake and patriotic place as Hawkeye
      (applause). I have traveled much, I have seen all parts of our glorious
      union, but I have never seen a lovelier village than yours, or one that
      has more signs of commercial and industrial and religious prosperity&mdash;(more
      applause).&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator then launched into a sketch of our great country, and dwelt
      for an hour or more upon its prosperity and the dangers which threatened
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then touched reverently upon the institutions of religion, and upon the
      necessity of private purity, if we were to have any public morality. &ldquo;I
      trust,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there are children within the sound of my voice,&rdquo;
       and after some remarks to them, the Senator closed with an apostrophe to
      &ldquo;the genius of American Liberty, walking with the Sunday School in one
      hand and Temperance in the other up the glorified steps of the National
      Capitol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Col. Sellers did not of course lose the opportunity to impress upon so
      influential a person as the Senator the desirability of improving the
      navigation of Columbus river. He and Mr. Brierly took the Senator over to
      Napoleon and opened to him their plan. It was a plan that the Senator
      could understand without a great deal of explanation, for he seemed to be
      familiar with the like improvements elsewhere. When, however, they reached
      Stone&rsquo;s Landing the Senator looked about him and inquired,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this Napoleon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the nucleus, the nucleus,&rdquo; said the Colonel, unrolling his map.
      &ldquo;Here is the deepo, the church, the City Hall and so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see. How far from here is Columbus River? Does that stream empty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, why, that&rsquo;s Goose Run. Thar ain&rsquo;t no Columbus, thout&rsquo;n it&rsquo;s over to
      Hawkeye,&rdquo; interrupted one of the citizens, who had come out to stare at
      the strangers. &ldquo;A railroad come here last summer, but it haint been here
      no mo&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; the Colonel hastened to explain, &ldquo;in the old records Columbus
      River is called Goose Run. You see how it sweeps round the town&mdash;forty-nine
      miles to the Missouri; sloop navigation all the way pretty much drains
      this whole country; when it&rsquo;s improved steamboats will run right up here.
      It&rsquo;s got to be enlarged, deepened. You see by the map. Columbus River.
      This country must have water communication!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want a considerable appropriation, Col. Sellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say a million; is that your figure Mr. Brierly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;According to our surveys,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;a million would do it; a million
      spent on the river would make Napoleon worth two millions at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; nodded the Senator. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;d better begin by asking only for
      two or three hundred thousand, the usual way. You can begin to sell town
      lots on that appropriation you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator, himself, to do him justice, was not very much interested in
      the country or the stream, but he favored the appropriation, and he gave
      the Colonel and Mr. Brierly to understand that he would endeavor to get it
      through. Harry, who thought he was shrewd and understood Washington,
      suggested an interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he saw that the Senator was wounded by the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will offend me by repeating such an observation,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whatever
      I do will be for the public interest. It will require a portion of the
      appropriation for necessary expenses, and I am sorry to say that there are
      members who will have to be seen. But you can reckon upon my humble
      services.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This aspect of the subject was not again alluded to. The Senator possessed
      himself of the facts, not from his observation of the ground, but from the
      lips of Col. Sellers, and laid the appropriation scheme away among his
      other plans for benefiting the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on this visit also that the Senator made the acquaintance of Mr.
      Washington Hawkins, and was greatly taken with his innocence, his
      guileless manner and perhaps with his ready adaptability to enter upon any
      plan proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Sellers was pleased to see this interest that Washington had
      awakened, especially since it was likely to further his expectations with
      regard to the Tennessee lands; the Senator having remarked to the Colonel,
      that he delighted to help any deserving young man, when the promotion of a
      private advantage could at the same time be made to contribute to the
      general good. And he did not doubt that this was an opportunity of that
      kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of several conferences with Washington was that the Senator
      proposed that he should go to Washington with him and become his private
      secretary and the secretary of his committee; a proposal which was eagerly
      accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator spent Sunday in Hawkeye and attended church. He cheered the
      heart of the worthy and zealous minister by an expression of his sympathy
      in his labors, and by many inquiries in regard to the religious state of
      the region. It was not a very promising state, and the good man felt how
      much lighter his task would be, if he had the aid of such a man as Senator
      Dilworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to see, my dear sir,&rdquo; said the Senator, &ldquo;that you give them the
      doctrines. It is owing to a neglect of the doctrines, that there is such a
      fearful falling away in the country. I wish that we might have you in
      Washington&mdash;as chaplain, now, in the senate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The good man could not but be a little flattered, and if sometimes,
      thereafter, in his discouraging work, he allowed the thought that he might
      perhaps be called to Washington as chaplain of the Senate, to cheer him,
      who can wonder. The Senator&rsquo;s commendation at least did one service for
      him, it elevated him in the opinion of Hawkeye.
    </p>

    <p>
      Laura was at church alone that day, and Mr. Brierly walked home with her.
      A part of their way lay with that of General Boswell and Senator
      Dilworthy, and introductions were made. Laura had her own reasons for
      wishing to know the Senator, and the Senator was not a man who could be
      called indifferent to charms such as hers. That meek young lady so
      commended herself to him in the short walk, that he announced his
      intentions of paying his respects to her the next day, an intention which
      Harry received glumly; and when the Senator was out of hearing he called
      him &ldquo;an old fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fie,&rdquo; said Laura, &ldquo;I do believe you are jealous, Harry. He is a very
      pleasant man. He said you were a young man of great promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator did call next day, and the result of his visit was that he was
      confirmed in his impression that there was something about him very
      attractive to ladies. He saw Laura again and again during his stay, and
      felt more and more the subtle influence of her feminine beauty, which
      every man felt who came near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was beside himself with rage while the Senator remained in town; he
      declared that women were always ready to drop any man for higher game; and
      he attributed his own ill-luck to the Senator&rsquo;s appearance. The fellow was
      in fact crazy about her beauty and ready to beat his brains out in
      chagrin. Perhaps Laura enjoyed his torment, but she soothed him with
      blandishments that increased his ardor, and she smiled to herself to think
      that he had, with all his protestations of love, never spoken of marriage.
      Probably the vivacious fellow never had thought of it. At any rate when he
      at length went away from Hawkeye he was no nearer it. But there was no
      telling to what desperate lengths his passion might not carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura bade him good bye with tender regret, which, however, did not
      disturb her peace or interfere with her plans. The visit of Senator
      Dilworthy had become of more importance to her, and it by and by bore the
      fruit she longed for, in an invitation to visit his family in the National
      Capital during the winter session of Congress.

      Whether medicine is a science, or only an empirical method of getting a
      living out of the ignorance of the human race, Ruth found before her first
      term was over at the medical school that there were other things she
      needed to know quite as much as that which is taught in medical books, and
      that she could never satisfy her aspirations without more general culture.

    </p>
    <p>
      In this condition of mind and body the quiet of her home and the
      unexciting companionship of those about her were more than ever tiresome.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed with more interest Philip&rsquo;s sparkling account of his life in
      the west, and longed for his experiences, and to know some of those people
      of a world so different from here, who alternately amused and displeased
      him. He at least was learning the world, the good and the bad of it, as
      must happen to every one who accomplishes anything in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what, Ruth wrote, could a woman do, tied up by custom, and cast into
      particular circumstances out of which it was almost impossible to
      extricate herself? Philip thought that he would go some day and extricate
      Ruth, but he did not write that, for he had the instinct to know that this
      was not the extrication she dreamed of, and that she must find out by her
      own experience what her heart really wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was not a philosopher, to be sure, but he had the old fashioned
      notion, that whatever a woman&rsquo;s theories of life might be, she would come
      round to matrimony, only give her time. He could indeed recall to mind one
      woman&mdash;and he never knew a nobler&mdash;whose whole soul was devoted
      and who believed that her life was consecrated to a certain benevolent
      project in singleness of life, who yielded to the touch of matrimony, as
      an icicle yields to a sunbeam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither at home nor elsewhere did Ruth utter any complaint, or admit any
      weariness or doubt of her ability to pursue the path she had marked out
      for herself. But her mother saw clearly enough her struggle with
      infirmity, and was not deceived by either her gaiety or by the cheerful
      composure which she carried into all the ordinary duties that fell to her.
      She saw plainly enough that Ruth needed an entire change of scene and of
      occupation, and perhaps she believed that such a change, with the
      knowledge of the world it would bring, would divert Ruth from a course for
      which she felt she was physically entirely unfitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It therefore suited the wishes of all concerned, when autumn came, that
      Ruth should go away to school. She selected a large New England Seminary,
      of which she had often heard Philip speak, which was attended by both
      sexes and offered almost collegiate advantages of education. Thither she
      went in September, and began for the second time in the year a life new to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Seminary was the chief feature of Fallkill, a village of two to three
      thousand inhabitants. It was a prosperous school, with three hundred
      students, a large corps of teachers, men and women, and with a venerable
      rusty row of academic buildings on the shaded square of the town. The
      students lodged and boarded in private families in the place, and so it
      came about that while the school did a great deal to support the town, the
      town gave the students society and the sweet influences of home life. It
      is at least respectful to say that the influences of home life are sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth&rsquo;s home, by the intervention of Philip, was in a family&mdash;one of
      the rare exceptions in life or in fiction&mdash;that had never known
      better days. The Montagues, it is perhaps well to say, had intended to
      come over in the Mayflower, but were detained at Delft Haven by the
      illness of a child. They came over to Massachusetts Bay in another vessel,
      and thus escaped the onus of that brevet nobility under which the
      successors of the Mayflower Pilgrims have descended. Having no factitious
      weight of dignity to carry, the Montagues steadily improved their
      condition from the day they landed, and they were never more vigorous or
      prosperous than at the date of this narrative. With character compacted by
      the rigid Puritan discipline of more than two centuries, they had retained
      its strength and purity and thrown off its narrowness, and were now
      blossoming under the generous modern influences. Squire Oliver Montague, a
      lawyer who had retired from the practice of his profession except in rare
      cases, dwelt in a square old fashioned New England mansion a quarter of a
      mile away from the green.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="p196" id="p196"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p196.jpg (15K)" src="images/p196.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was called a mansion because it stood alone with ample fields about it,
      and had an avenue of trees leading to it from the road, and on the west
      commanded a view of a pretty little lake with gentle slopes and nodding
      were now blossoming under the generous modern influences. But it was just
      a plain, roomy house, capable of extending to many guests an unpretending
      hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family consisted of the Squire and his wife, a son and a daughter
      married and not at home, a son in college at Cambridge, another son at the
      Seminary, and a daughter Alice, who was a year or more older than Ruth.
      Having only riches enough to be able to gratify reasonable desires, and
      yet make their gratifications always a novelty and a pleasure, the family
      occupied that just mean in life which is so rarely attained, and still
      more rarely enjoyed without discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Ruth did not find so much luxury in the house as in her own home, there
      were evidences of culture, of intellectual activity and of a zest in the
      affairs of all the world, which greatly impressed her. Every room had its
      book-cases or book-shelves, and was more or less a library; upon every
      table was liable to be a litter of new books, fresh periodicals and daily
      newspapers.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="p197" id="p197"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p197.jpg (16K)" src="images/p197.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There were plants in the sunny windows and some choice engravings on the
      walls, with bits of color in oil or water-colors; the piano was sure to be
      open and strewn with music; and there were photographs and little
      souvenirs here and there of foreign travel. An absence of any &ldquo;what-pots&rdquo;
       in the corners with rows of cheerful shells, and Hindoo gods, and Chinese
      idols, and nests of useless boxes of lacquered wood, might be taken as
      denoting a languidness in the family concerning foreign missions, but
      perhaps unjustly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate the life of the world flowed freely into this hospitable
      house, and there was always so much talk there of the news of the day, of
      the new books and of authors, of Boston radicalism and New York
      civilization, and the virtue of Congress, that small gossip stood a very
      poor chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was in many ways so new to Ruth that she seemed to have passed
      into another world, in which she experienced a freedom and a mental
      exhilaration unknown to her before. Under this influence she entered upon
      her studies with keen enjoyment, finding for a time all the relaxation she
      needed, in the charming social life at the Montague house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is strange, she wrote to Philip, in one of her occasional letters, that
      you never told me more about this delightful family, and scarcely
      mentioned Alice who is the life of it, just the noblest girl, unselfish,
      knows how to do so many things, with lots of talent, with a dry humor, and
      an odd way of looking at things, and yet quiet and even serious often&mdash;one
      of your &ldquo;capable&rdquo; New England girls. We shall be great friends. It had
      never occurred to Philip that there was any thing extraordinary about the
      family that needed mention. He knew dozens of girls like Alice, he thought
      to himself, but only one like Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good friends the two girls were from the beginning. Ruth was a study to
      Alice; the product of a culture entirely foreign to her experience, so
      much a child in some things, so much a woman in others; and Ruth in turn,
      it must be confessed, probing Alice sometimes with her serious grey eyes,
      wondered what her object in life was, and whether she had any purpose
      beyond living as she now saw her. For she could scarcely conceive of a
      life that should not be devoted to the accomplishment of some definite
      work, and she had no doubt that in her own case everything else would
      yield to the professional career she had marked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you know Philip Sterling,&rdquo; said Ruth one day as the girls sat at their
      sewing. Ruth never embroidered, and never sewed when she could avoid it.
      Bless her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, we are old friends. Philip used to come to Fallkill often while
      he was in college. He was once rusticated here for a term.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rusticated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suspended for some College scrape. He was a great favorite here. Father
      and he were famous friends. Father said that Philip had no end of nonsense
      in him and was always blundering into something, but he was a royal good
      fellow and would come out all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you think he was fickle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I never thought whether he was or not,&rdquo; replied Alice looking up. &ldquo;I
      suppose he was always in love with some girl or another, as college boys
      are. He used to make me his confidant now and then, and be terribly in the
      dumps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did he come to you?&rdquo; pursued Ruth, &ldquo;you were younger than he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know. He was at our house a good deal. Once at a picnic
      by the lake, at the risk of his own life, he saved sister Millie from
      drowning, and we all liked to have him here. Perhaps he thought as he had
      saved one sister, the other ought to help him when he was in trouble. I
      don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fact was that Alice was a person who invited confidences, because she
      never betrayed them, and gave abundant sympathy in return. There are
      persons, whom we all know, to whom human confidences, troubles and
      heart-aches flow as naturally as streams to a placid lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a history of Fallkill, nor of the Montague family, worthy as
      both are of that honor, and this narrative cannot be diverted into long
      loitering with them. If the reader visits the village to-day, he will
      doubtless be pointed out the Montague dwelling, where Ruth lived, the
      cross-lots path she traversed to the Seminary, and the venerable chapel
      with its cracked bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little society of the place, the Quaker girl was a favorite, and no
      considerable social gathering or pleasure party was thought complete
      without her. There was something in this seemingly transparent and yet
      deep character, in her childlike gaiety and enjoyment of the society about
      her, and in her not seldom absorption in herself, that would have made her
      long remembered there if no events had subsequently occurred to recall her
      to mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the surprise of Alice, Ruth took to the small gaieties of the village
      with a zest of enjoyment that seemed foreign to one who had devoted her
      life to a serious profession from the highest motives. Alice liked society
      well enough, she thought, but there was nothing exciting in that of
      Fallkill, nor anything novel in the attentions of the well-bred young
      gentlemen one met in it. It must have worn a different aspect to Ruth, for
      she entered into its pleasures at first with curiosity, and then with
      interest and finally with a kind of staid abandon that no one would have
      deemed possible for her. Parties, picnics, rowing-matches, moonlight
      strolls, nutting expeditions in the October woods,&mdash;Alice declared
      that it was a whirl of dissipation. The fondness of Ruth, which was
      scarcely disguised, for the company of agreeable young fellows, who talked
      nothings, gave Alice opportunity for no end of banter.
    </p>
    <p>

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you look upon them as I subjects, dear?&rdquo; she would ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ruth laughed her merriest laugh, and then looked sober again. Perhaps
      she was thinking, after all, whether she knew herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you should rear a duck in the heart of the Sahara, no doubt it would
      swim if you brought it to the Nile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely no one would have predicted when Ruth left Philadelphia that she
      would become absorbed to this extent, and so happy, in a life so unlike
      that she thought she desired. But no one can tell how a woman will act
      under any circumstances. The reason novelists nearly always fail in
      depicting women when they make them act, is that they let them do what
      they have observed some woman has done at sometime or another. And that is
      where they make a mistake; for a woman will never do again what has been
      done before. It is this uncertainty that causes women, considered as
      materials for fiction, to be so interesting to themselves and to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the fall went on and the winter, Ruth did not distinguish herself
      greatly at the Fallkill Seminary as a student, a fact that apparently gave
      her no anxiety, and did not diminish her enjoyment of a new sort of power
      which had awakened within her.

      <a name="ch22" id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In mid-winter, an event occurred of unusual interest to the inhabitants of
      the Montague house, and to the friends of the young ladies who sought
      their society.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the arrival at the Sassacua Hotel of two young gentlemen from the
      west.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the fashion in New England to give Indian names to the public
      houses, not that the late lamented savage knew how to keep a hotel, but
      that his warlike name may impress the traveler who humbly craves shelter
      there, and make him grateful to the noble and gentlemanly clerk if he is
      allowed to depart with his scalp safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young gentlemen were neither students for the Fallkill Seminary,
      nor lecturers on physiology, nor yet life assurance solicitors, three
      suppositions that almost exhausted the guessing power of the people at the
      hotel in respect to the names of &ldquo;Philip Sterling and Henry Brierly,
      Missouri,&rdquo; on the register. They were handsome enough fellows, that was
      evident, browned by out-door exposure, and with a free and lordly way
      about them that almost awed the hotel clerk himself. Indeed, he very soon
      set down Mr. Brierly as a gentleman of large fortune, with enormous
      interests on his shoulders. Harry had a way of casually mentioning western
      investments, through lines, the freighting business, and the route through
      the Indian territory to Lower California, which was calculated to give an
      importance to his lightest word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a pleasant town here, sir, and the most comfortable looking hotel
      I&rsquo;ve seen out of New York,&rdquo; said Harry to the clerk; &ldquo;we shall stay here a
      few days if you can give us a roomy suite of apartments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry usually had the best of everything, wherever he went, as such
      fellows always do have in this accommodating world. Philip would have been
      quite content with less expensive quarters, but there was no resisting
      Harry&rsquo;s generosity in such matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Railroad surveying and real-estate operations were at a standstill during
      the winter in Missouri, and the young men had taken advantage of the lull
      to come east, Philip to see if there was any disposition in his friends,
      the railway contractors, to give him a share in the Salt Lick Union
      Pacific Extension, and Harry to open out to his uncle the prospects of the
      new city at Stone&rsquo;s Landing, and to procure congressional appropriations
      for the harbor and for making Goose Run navigable. Harry had with him a
      map of that noble stream and of the harbor, with a perfect net-work of
      railroads centering in it, pictures of wharves, crowded with steamboats,
      and of huge grain-elevators on the bank, all of which grew out of the
      combined imaginations of Col. Sellers and Mr. Brierly. The Colonel had
      entire confidence in Harry&rsquo;s influence with Wall street, and with
      congressmen, to bring about the consummation of their scheme, and he
      waited his return in the empty house at Hawkeye, feeding his pinched
      family upon the most gorgeous expectations with a reckless prodigality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let &lsquo;em into the thing more than is necessary,&rdquo; says the Colonel to
      Harry; &ldquo;give &lsquo;em a small interest; a lot apiece in the suburbs of the
      Landing ought to do a congressman, but I reckon you&rsquo;ll have to mortgage a
      part of the city itself to the brokers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry did not find that eagerness to lend money on Stone&rsquo;s Landing in Wall
      street which Col. Sellers had expected, (it had seen too many such maps as
      he exhibited), although his uncle and some of the brokers looked with more
      favor on the appropriation for improving the navigation of Columbus River,
      and were not disinclined to form a company for that purpose. An
      appropriation was a tangible thing, if you could get hold of it, and it
      made little difference what it was appropriated for, so long as you got
      hold of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pending these weighty negotiations, Philip has persuaded Harry to take a
      little run up to Fallkill, a not difficult task, for that young man would
      at any time have turned his back upon all the land in the West at sight of
      a new and pretty face, and he had, it must be confessed, a facility in
      love making which made it not at all an interference with the more serious
      business of life. He could not, to be sure, conceive how Philip could be
      interested in a young lady who was studying medicine, but he had no
      objection to going, for he did not doubt that there were other girls in
      Fallkill who were worth a week&rsquo;s attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men were received at the house of the Montagues with the
      hospitality which never failed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are glad to see you again,&rdquo; exclaimed the Squire heartily, &ldquo;you are
      welcome Mr. Brierly, any friend of Phil&rsquo;s is welcome at our house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more like home to me, than any place except my own home,&rdquo; cried
      Philip, as he looked about the cheerful house and went through a general
      hand-shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time, though, since you have been here to say so,&rdquo; Alice
      said, with her father&rsquo;s frankness of manner; &ldquo;and I suspect we owe the
      visit now to your sudden interest in the Fallkill Seminary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip&rsquo;s color came, as it had an awkward way of doing in his tell-tale
      face, but before he could stammer a reply, Harry came in with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That accounts for Phil&rsquo;s wish to build a Seminary at Stone&rsquo;s Landing, our
      place in Missouri, when Col. Sellers insisted it should be a University.
      Phil appears to have a weakness for Seminaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been better for your friend Sellers,&rdquo; retorted Philip, &ldquo;if
      he had had a weakness for district schools. Col. Sellers, Miss Alice, is a
      great friend of Harry&rsquo;s, who is always trying to build a house by
      beginning at the top.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s as easy to build a University on paper as a Seminary, and
      it looks better,&rdquo; was Harry&rsquo;s reflection; at which the Squire laughed, and
      said he quite agreed with him. The old gentleman understood Stone&rsquo;s
      Landing a good deal better than he would have done after an hour&rsquo;s talk
      with either of it&rsquo;s expectant proprietors.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, and while Philip was trying to frame a question that he
      found it exceedingly difficult to put into words, the door opened quietly,
      and Ruth entered. Taking in the group with a quick glance, her eye lighted
      up, and with a merry smile she advanced and shook hands with Philip. She
      was so unconstrained and sincerely cordial, that it made that hero of the
      west feel somehow young, and very ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      For months and months he had thought of this meeting and pictured it to
      himself a hundred times, but he had never imagined it would be like this.
      He should meet Ruth unexpectedly, as she was walking alone from the
      school, perhaps, or entering the room where he was waiting for her, and
      she would cry &ldquo;Oh! Phil,&rdquo; and then check herself, and perhaps blush, and
      Philip calm but eager and enthusiastic, would reassure her by his warm
      manner, and he would take her hand impressively, and she would look up
      timidly, and, after his long absence, perhaps he would be permitted to&mdash;
      Good heavens, how many times he had come to this point, and wondered if it
      could happen so. Well, well; he had never supposed that he should be the
      one embarrassed, and above all by a sincere and cordial welcome.

      &ldquo;We heard you were at the Sassacus House,&rdquo; were Ruth&rsquo;s first words; &ldquo;and
      this I suppose is your friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; Philip at length blundered out, &ldquo;this is Mr. Brierly
      of whom I have written you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Ruth welcomed Harry with a friendliness that Philip thought was due to
      his friend, to be sure, but which seemed to him too level with her
      reception of himself, but which Harry received as his due from the other
      sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Questions were asked about the journey and about the West, and the
      conversation became a general one, until Philip at length found himself
      talking with the Squire in relation to land and railroads and things he
      couldn&rsquo;t keep his mind on especially as he heard Ruth and Harry in an
      animated discourse, and caught the words &ldquo;New York,&rdquo; and &ldquo;opera,&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;reception,&rdquo; and knew that Harry was giving his imagination full range in
      the world of fashion.

      Harry knew all about the opera, green room and all (at least he said so)
      and knew a good many of the operas and could make very entertaining
      stories of their plots, telling how the soprano came in here, and the
      basso here, humming the beginning of their airs&mdash;tum-ti-tum-ti-ti&mdash;suggesting
      the profound dissatisfaction of the basso recitative&mdash;down-among-the-dead-men&mdash;and
      touching off the whole with an airy grace quite captivating; though he
      couldn&rsquo;t have sung a single air through to save himself, and he hadn&rsquo;t an
      ear to know whether it was sung correctly. All the same he doted on the
      opera, and kept a box there, into which he lounged occasionally to hear a
      favorite scene and meet his society friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Ruth was ever in the city he should be happy to place his box at the
      disposal of Ruth and her friends. Needless to say that she was delighted
      with the offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she told Philip of it, that discreet young fellow only smiled, and
      said that he hoped she would be fortunate enough to be in New York some
      evening when Harry had not already given the use of his private box to
      some other friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squire pressed the visitors to let him send for their trunks and urged
      them to stay at his house, and Alice joined in the invitation, but Philip
      had reasons for declining. They staid to supper however, and in the
      evening Philip had a long talk apart with Ruth, a delightful hour to him,
      in which she spoke freely of herself as of old, of her studies at
      Philadelphia and of her plans, and she entered into his adventures and
      prospects in the West with a genuine and almost sisterly interest; an
      interest, however, which did not exactly satisfy Philip&mdash;it was too
      general and not personal enough to suit him. And with all her freedom in
      speaking of her own hopes, Philip could not, detect any reference to
      himself in them; whereas he never undertook anything that he did not think
      of Ruth in connection with it, he never made a plan that had not reference
      to her, and he never thought of anything as complete if she could not
      share it. Fortune, reputation these had no value to him except in Ruth&rsquo;s
      eyes, and there were times when it seemed to him that if Ruth was not on
      this earth, he should plunge off into some remote wilderness and live in a
      purposeless seclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hoped,&rdquo; said Philip; &ldquo;to get a little start in connection with this new
      railroad, and make a little money, so that I could come east and engage in
      something more suited to my tastes. I shouldn&rsquo;t like to live in the West.
      Would you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never occurred to me whether I would or not,&rdquo; was the unembarrassed
      reply. &ldquo;One of our graduates went to Chicago, and has a nice practice
      there. I don&rsquo;t know where I shall go. It would mortify mother dreadfully
      to have me driving about Philadelphia in a doctor&rsquo;s gig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip laughed at the idea of it. &ldquo;And does it seem as necessary to you to
      do it as it did before you came to Fallkill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a home question, and went deeper than Philip knew, for Ruth at once
      thought of practicing her profession among the young gentlemen and ladies
      of her acquaintance in the village; but she was reluctant to admit to
      herself that her notions of a career had undergone any change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think I should come to Fallkill to practice, but I must do
      something when I am through school; and why not medicine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip would like to have explained why not, but the explanation would be
      of no use if it were not already obvious to Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was equally in his element whether instructing Squire Montague about
      the investment of capital in Missouri, the improvement of Columbus River,
      the project he and some gentlemen in New York had for making a shorter
      Pacific connection with the Mississippi than the present one; or diverting
      Mrs. Montague with his experience in cooking in camp; or drawing for Miss
      Alice an amusing picture of the social contrasts of New England and the
      border where he had been. Harry was a very entertaining fellow, having his
      imagination to help his memory, and telling his stories as if he believed
      them&mdash;as perhaps he did. Alice was greatly amused with Harry and
      listened so seriously to his romancing that he exceeded his usual limits.
      Chance allusions to his bachelor establishment in town and the place of
      his family on the Hudson, could not have been made by a millionaire, more
      naturally.

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; queried Alice, &ldquo;you would rather stay in New York than
      to try the rough life at the West you have been speaking of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, adventure,&rdquo; says Harry, &ldquo;I get tired of New York. And besides I got
      involved in some operations that I had to see through. Parties in New York
      only last week wanted me to go down into Arizona in a big diamond
      interest. I told them, no, no speculation for me. I&rsquo;ve got my interests in
      Missouri; and I wouldn&rsquo;t leave Philip, as long as he stays there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the young gentlemen were on their way back to the hotel, Mr. Philip,
      who was not in very good humor, broke out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce, Harry, did you go on in that style to the Montagues for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on?&rdquo; cried Harry. &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t I try to make a pleasant evening? And
      besides, ain&rsquo;t I going to do those things? What difference does it make
      about the mood and tense of a mere verb? Didn&rsquo;t uncle tell me only last
      Saturday, that I might as well go down to Arizona and hunt for diamonds? A
      fellow might as well make a good impression as a poor one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense. You&rsquo;ll get to believing your own romancing by and by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll see. When Sellers and I get that appropriation, I&rsquo;ll show
      you an establishment in town and another on the Hudson and a box at the
      opera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it will be like Col. Sellers&rsquo; plantation at Hawkeye. Did you ever
      see that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t be cross, Phil. She&rsquo;s just superb, that little woman. You
      never told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s just superb?&rdquo; growled Philip, fancying this turn of the
      conversation less than the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Montague, if you must know.&rdquo; And Harry stopped to light a
      cigar, and then puffed on in silence. The little quarrel didn&rsquo;t last over
      night, for Harry never appeared to cherish any ill-will half a second, and
      Philip was too sensible to continue a row about nothing; and he had
      invited Harry to come with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentlemen stayed in Fallkill a week, and were every day at the
      Montagues, and took part in the winter gaieties of the village. There were
      parties here and there to which the friends of Ruth and the Montagues were
      of course invited, and Harry in the generosity of his nature, gave in
      return a little supper at the hotel, very simple indeed, with dancing in
      the hall, and some refreshments passed round. And Philip found the whole
      thing in the bill when he came to pay it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the week was over Philip thought he had a new light on the
      character of Ruth. Her absorption in the small gaieties of the society
      there surprised him. He had few opportunities for serious conversation
      with her. There was always some butterfly or another flitting about, and
      when Philip showed by his manner that he was not pleased, Ruth laughed
      merrily enough and rallied him on his soberness&mdash;she declared he was
      getting to be grim and unsocial. He talked indeed more with Alice than
      with Ruth, and scarcely concealed from her the trouble that was in his
      mind. It needed, in fact, no word from him, for she saw clearly enough
      what was going forward, and knew her sex well enough to know there was no
      remedy for it but time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth is a dear girl, Philip, and has as much firmness of purpose as ever,
      but don&rsquo;t you see she has just discovered that she is fond of society?
      Don&rsquo;t you let her see you are selfish about it, is my advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last evening they were to spend in Fallkill, they were at the
      Montagues, and Philip hoped that he would find Ruth in a different mood.
      But she was never more gay, and there was a spice of mischief in her eye
      and in her laugh. &ldquo;Confound it,&rdquo; said Philip to himself, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s in a
      perfect twitter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would have liked to quarrel with her, and fling himself out of the
      house in tragedy style, going perhaps so far as to blindly wander off
      miles into the country and bathe his throbbing brow in the chilling rain
      of the stars, as people do in novels; but he had no opportunity. For Ruth
      was as serenely unconscious of mischief as women can be at times, and
      fascinated him more than ever with her little demurenesses and
      half-confidences. She even said &ldquo;Thee&rdquo; to him once in reproach for a
      cutting speech he began. And the sweet little word made his heart beat
      like a trip-hammer, for never in all her life had she said &ldquo;thee&rdquo; to him
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was she fascinated with Harry&rsquo;s careless &lsquo;bon homie&rsquo; and gay assurance?
      Both chatted away in high spirits, and made the evening whirl along in the
      most mirthful manner. Ruth sang for Harry, and that young gentleman turned
      the leaves for her at the piano, and put in a bass note now and then where
      he thought it would tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was a merry evening, and Philip was heartily glad when it was
      over, and the long leave-taking with the family was through with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell Philip. Good night Mr. Brierly,&rdquo; Ruth&rsquo;s clear voice sounded
      after them as they went down the walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she spoke Harry&rsquo;s name last, thought Philip.

      Phillip and Harry reached New York in very different states of mind. Harry
      was buoyant. He found a letter from Col. Sellers urging him to go to
      Washington and confer with Senator Dilworthy. The petition was in his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been signed by everybody of any importance in Missouri, and would
      be presented immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should go on myself,&rdquo; wrote the Colonel, &ldquo;but I am engaged in the
      invention of a process for lighting such a city as St. Louis by means of
      water; just attach my machine to the water-pipes anywhere and the
      decomposition of the fluid begins, and you will have floods of light for
      the mere cost of the machine. I&rsquo;ve nearly got the lighting part, but I
      want to attach to it a heating, cooking, washing and ironing apparatus.
      It&rsquo;s going to be the great thing, but we&rsquo;d better keep this appropriation
      going while I am perfecting it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry took letters to several congressmen from his uncle and from Mr. Duff
      Brown, each of whom had an extensive acquaintance in both houses where
      they were well known as men engaged in large private operations for the
      public good and men, besides, who, in the slang of the day, understood the
      virtues of &ldquo;addition, division and silence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dilworthy introduced the petition into the Senate with the remark
      that he knew, personally, the signers of it, that they were men
      interested, it was true, in the improvement of the country, but he
      believed without any selfish motive, and that so far as he knew the
      signers were loyal. It pleased him to see upon the roll the names of many
      colored citizens, and it must rejoice every friend of humanity to know
      that this lately emancipated race were intelligently taking part in the
      development of the resources of their native land. He moved the reference
      of the petition to the proper committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dilworthy introduced his young friend to influential members, as a
      person who was very well informed about the Salt Lick Extension of the
      Pacific, and was one of the Engineers who had made a careful survey of
      Columbus River; and left him to exhibit his maps and plans and to show the
      connection between the public treasury, the city of Napoleon and
      legislation for the benefit off the whole country.

    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was the guest of Senator Dilworthy. There was scarcely any good
      movement in which the Senator was not interested. His house was open to
      all the laborers in the field of total abstinence, and much of his time
      was taken up in attending the meetings of this cause. He had a Bible class
      in the Sunday school of the church which he attended, and he suggested to
      Harry that he might take a class during the time he remained in
      Washington. Mr. Washington Hawkins had a class. Harry asked the Senator if
      there was a class of young ladies for him to teach, and after that the
      Senator did not press the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip, if the truth must be told, was not well satisfied with his western
      prospects, nor altogether with the people he had fallen in with. The
      railroad contractors held out large but rather indefinite promises.
      Opportunities for a fortune he did not doubt existed in Missouri, but for
      himself he saw no better means for livelihood than the mastery of the
      profession he had rather thoughtlessly entered upon. During the summer he
      had made considerable practical advance in the science of engineering; he
      had been diligent, and made himself to a certain extent necessary to the
      work he was engaged on. The contractors called him into their
      consultations frequently, as to the character of the country he had been
      over, and the cost of constructing the road, the nature of the work, etc.
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Philip felt that if he was going to make either reputation or money
      as an engineer, he had a great deal of hard study before him, and it is to
      his credit that he did not shrink from it. While Harry was in Washington
      dancing attendance upon the national legislature and making the
      acquaintance of the vast lobby that encircled it, Philip devoted himself
      day and night, with an energy and a concentration he was capable of, to
      the learning and theory of his profession, and to the science of railroad
      building. He wrote some papers at this time for the &ldquo;Plow, the Loom and
      the Anvil,&rdquo; upon the strength of materials, and especially upon
      bridge-building, which attracted considerable attention, and were copied
      into the English &ldquo;Practical Magazine.&rdquo; They served at any rate to raise
      Philip in the opinion of his friends the contractors, for practical men
      have a certain superstitious estimation of ability with the pen, and
      though they may a little despise the talent, they are quite ready to make
      use of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip sent copies of his performances to Ruth&rsquo;s father and to other
      gentlemen whose good opinion he coveted, but he did not rest upon his
      laurels. Indeed, so diligently had he applied himself, that when it came
      time for him to return to the West, he felt himself, at least in theory,
      competent to take charge of a division in the field.

      The capital of the Great Republic was a new world to country-bred
      Washington Hawkins. St. Louis was a greater city, but its floating
      population did not hail from great distances, and so it had the general
      family aspect of the permanent population; but Washington gathered its
      people from the four winds of heaven, and so the manners, the faces and
      the fashions there, presented a variety that was infinite. Washington had
      never been in &ldquo;society&rdquo; in St. Louis, and he knew nothing of the ways of
      its wealthier citizens and had never inspected one of their dwellings.
      Consequently, everything in the nature of modern fashion and grandeur was
      a new and wonderful revelation to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington is an interesting city to any of us. It seems to become more
      and more interesting the oftener we visit it. Perhaps the reader has never
      been there? Very well. You arrive either at night, rather too late to do
      anything or see anything until morning, or you arrive so early in the
      morning that you consider it best to go to your hotel and sleep an hour or
      two while the sun bothers along over the Atlantic. You cannot well arrive
      at a pleasant intermediate hour, because the railway corporation that
      keeps the keys of the only door that leads into the town or out of it take
      care of that. You arrive in tolerably good spirits, because it is only
      thirty-eight miles from Baltimore to the capital, and so you have only
      been insulted three times (provided you are not in a sleeping car&mdash;the
      average is higher there): once when you renewed your ticket after stopping
      over in Baltimore; once when you were about to enter the &ldquo;ladies&rsquo; car&rdquo;
       without knowing it was a lady&rsquo;s car; and once when you asked the conductor
      at what hour you would reach Washington.

      You reach your hotel, presently&mdash;and here let us draw the curtain of
      charity&mdash;because of course you have gone to the wrong one. You being
      a stranger, how could you do otherwise? There are a hundred and eighteen
      bad hotels, and only one good one. The most renowned and popular hotel of
      them all is perhaps the worst one known to history.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is winter, and night. When you arrived, it was snowing. When you
      reached the hotel, it was sleeting. When you went to bed, it was raining.
      During the night it froze hard, and the wind blew some chimneys down. When
      you got up in the morning, it was foggy. When you finished your breakfast
      at ten o&rsquo;clock and went out, the sunshine was brilliant, the weather balmy
      and delicious, and the mud and slush deep and all-pervading. You will like
      the climate when you get used to it.

    </p>
    <p>
      You naturally wish to view the city; so you take an umbrella, an overcoat,
      and a fan, and go forth. The prominent features you soon locate and get
      familiar with; first you glimpse the ornamental upper works of a long,
      snowy palace projecting above a grove of trees, and a tall, graceful white
      dome with a statue on it surmounting the palace and pleasantly contrasting
      with the background of blue sky. That building is the capitol; gossips
      will tell you that by the original estimates it was to cost $12,000,000,
      and that the government did come within $21,200,000 of building it for
      that sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      You stand at the back of the capitol to treat yourself to a view, and it
      is a very noble one. You understand, the capitol stands upon the verge of
      a high piece of table land, a fine commanding position, and its front
      looks out over this noble situation for a city&mdash;but it don&rsquo;t see it,
      for the reason that when the capitol extension was decided upon, the
      property owners at once advanced their prices to such inhuman figures that
      the people went down and built the city in the muddy low marsh behind the
      temple of liberty; so now the lordly front of the building, with, its
      imposing colonades, its projecting graceful wings, its picturesque groups
      of statuary, and its long terraced ranges of steps, flowing down in white
      marble waves to the ground, merely looks out upon a sorrowful little
      desert of cheap boarding houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      So you observe, that you take your view from the back of the capitol. And
      yet not from the airy outlooks of the dome, by the way, because to get
      there you must pass through the great rotunda: and to do that, you would
      have to see the marvelous Historical Paintings that hang there, and the
      bas-reliefs&mdash;and what have you done that you should suffer thus? And
      besides, you might have to pass through the old part of the building, and
      you could not help seeing Mr. Lincoln, as petrified by a young lady artist
      for $10,000&mdash;and you might take his marble emancipation proclamation,
      which he holds out in his hand and contemplates, for a folded napkin; and
      you might conceive from his expression and his attitude, that he is
      finding fault with the washing. Which is not the case. Nobody knows what
      is the matter with him; but everybody feels for him. Well, you ought not
      to go into the dome anyhow, because it would be utterly impossible to go
      up there without seeing the frescoes in it&mdash;and why should you be
      interested in the delirium tremens of art?
    </p>
    <p>
      The capitol is a very noble and a very beautiful building, both within and
      without, but you need not examine it now. Still, if you greatly prefer
      going into the dome, go. Now your general glance gives you picturesque
      stretches of gleaming water, on your left, with a sail here and there and
      a lunatic asylum on shore; over beyond the water, on a distant elevation,
      you see a squat yellow temple which your eye dwells upon lovingly through
      a blur of unmanly moisture, for it recalls your lost boyhood and the
      Parthenons done in molasses candy which made it blest and beautiful. Still
      in the distance, but on this side of the water and close to its edge, the
      Monument to the Father of his Country towers out of the mud&mdash;sacred
      soil is the customary term. It has the aspect of a factory chimney with
      the top broken off. The skeleton of a decaying scaffolding lingers about
      its summit, and tradition says that the spirit of Washington often comes
      down and sits on those rafters to enjoy this tribute of respect which the
      nation has reared as the symbol of its unappeasable gratitude.<br /> <br />
      <br /> <br />

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Monument is to be finished, some day, and at that time our Washington
      will have risen still higher in the nation&rsquo;s veneration, and will be known
      as the Great-Great-Grandfather of his Country. The memorial Chimney stands
      in a quiet pastoral locality that is full of reposeful expression. With a
      glass you can see the cow-sheds about its base, and the contented sheep
      nimbling pebbles in the desert solitudes that surround it, and the tired
      pigs dozing in the holy calm of its protecting shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you wrench your gaze loose, and you look down in front of you and see
      the broad Pennsylvania Avenue stretching straight ahead for a mile or more
      till it brings up against the iron fence in front of a pillared granite
      pile, the Treasury building-an edifice that would command respect in any
      capital. The stores and hotels that wall in this broad avenue are mean,
      and cheap, and dingy, and are better left without comment. Beyond the
      Treasury is a fine large white barn, with wide unhandsome grounds about
      it. The President lives there. It is ugly enough outside, but that is
      nothing to what it is inside. Dreariness, flimsiness, bad taste reduced to
      mathematical completeness is what the inside offers to the eye, if it
      remains yet what it always has been.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front and right hand views give you the city at large. It is a wide
      stretch of cheap little brick houses, with here and there a noble
      architectural pile lifting itself out of the midst&mdash;government
      buildings, these. If the thaw is still going on when you come down and go
      about town, you will wonder at the short-sightedness of the city fathers,
      when you come to inspect the streets, in that they do not dilute the mud a
      little more and use them for canals.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you inquire around a little, you will find that there are more
      boardinghouses to the square acre in Washington than there are in any
      other city in the land, perhaps. If you apply for a home in one of them,
      it will seem odd to you to have the landlady inspect you with a severe eye
      and then ask you if you are a member of Congress. Perhaps, just as a
      pleasantry, you will say yes. And then she will tell you that she is
      &ldquo;full.&rdquo; Then you show her her advertisement in the morning paper, and
      there she stands, convicted and ashamed. She will try to blush, and it
      will be only polite in you to take the effort for the deed. She shows you
      her rooms, now, and lets you take one&mdash;but she makes you pay in
      advance for it. That is what you will get for pretending to be a member of
      Congress. If you had been content to be merely a private citizen, your
      trunk would have been sufficient security for your board. If you are
      curious and inquire into this thing, the chances are that your landlady
      will be ill-natured enough to say that the person and property of a
      Congressman are exempt from arrest or detention, and that with the tears
      in her eyes she has seen several of the people&rsquo;s representatives walk off
      to their several States and Territories carrying her unreceipted board
      bills in their pockets for keepsakes. And before you have been in
      Washington many weeks you will be mean enough to believe her, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course you contrive to see everything and find out everything. And one
      of the first and most startling things you find out is, that every
      individual you encounter in the City of Washington almost&mdash;and
      certainly every separate and distinct individual in the public employment,
      from the highest bureau chief, clear down to the maid who scrubs
      Department halls, the night watchmen of the public buildings and the
      darkey boy who purifies the Department spittoons&mdash;represents
      Political Influence. Unless you can get the ear of a Senator, or a
      Congressman, or a Chief of a Bureau or Department, and persuade him to use
      his &ldquo;influence&rdquo; in your behalf, you cannot get an employment of the most
      trivial nature in Washington. Mere merit, fitness and capability, are
      useless baggage to you without &ldquo;influence.&rdquo; The population of Washington
      consists pretty much entirely of government employees and the people who
      board them. There are thousands of these employees, and they have gathered
      there from every corner of the Union and got their berths through the
      intercession (command is nearer the word) of the Senators and
      Representatives of their respective States. It would be an odd
      circumstance to see a girl get employment at three or four dollars a week
      in one of the great public cribs without any political grandee to back
      her, but merely because she was worthy, and competent, and a good citizen
      of a free country that &ldquo;treats all persons alike.&rdquo; Washington would be
      mildly thunderstruck at such a thing as that. If you are a member of
      Congress, (no offence,) and one of your constituents who doesn&rsquo;t know
      anything, and does not want to go into the bother of learning something,
      and has no money, and no employment, and can&rsquo;t earn a living, comes
      besieging you for help, do you say, &ldquo;Come, my friend, if your services
      were valuable you could get employment elsewhere&mdash;don&rsquo;t want you
      here?&rdquo; Oh, no: You take him to a Department and say, &ldquo;Here, give this
      person something to pass away the time at&mdash;and a salary&rdquo;&mdash;and
      the thing is done. You throw him on his country. He is his country&rsquo;s
      child, let his country support him. There is something good and motherly
      about Washington, the grand old benevolent National Asylum for the
      Helpless.

      The wages received by this great hive of employees are placed at the
      liberal figure meet and just for skilled and competent labor. Such of them
      as are immediately employed about the two Houses of Congress, are not only
      liberally paid also, but are remembered in the customary Extra
      Compensation bill which slides neatly through, annually, with the general
      grab that signalizes the last night of a session, and thus twenty per
      cent. is added to their wages, for&mdash;for fun, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington Hawkins&rsquo; new life was an unceasing delight to him. Senator
      Dilworthy lived sumptuously, and Washington&rsquo;s quarters were charming&mdash;gas;
      running water, hot and cold; bath-room, coal-fires, rich carpets,
      beautiful pictures on the walls; books on religion, temperance, public
      charities and financial schemes; trim colored servants, dainty food&mdash;everything
      a body could wish for. And as for stationery, there was no end to it; the
      government furnished it; postage stamps were not needed&mdash;the
      Senator&rsquo;s frank could convey a horse through the mails, if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he saw such dazzling company. Renowned generals and admirals who
      had seemed but colossal myths when he was in the far west, went in and out
      before him or sat at the Senator&rsquo;s table, solidified into palpable flesh
      and blood; famous statesmen crossed his path daily; that once rare and
      awe-inspiring being, a Congressman, was become a common spectacle&mdash;a
      spectacle so common, indeed, that he could contemplate it without
      excitement, even without embarrassment; foreign ministers were visible to
      the naked eye at happy intervals; he had looked upon the President
      himself, and lived. And more; this world of enchantment teemed with
      speculation&mdash;the whole atmosphere was thick with it&mdash;and that
      indeed was Washington Hawkins&rsquo; native air; none other refreshed his lungs
      so gratefully. He had found paradise at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he saw of his chief the Senator, the more he honored him, and the
      more conspicuously the moral grandeur of his character appeared to stand
      out. To possess the friendship and the kindly interest of such a man,
      Washington said in a letter to Louise, was a happy fortune for a young man
      whose career had been so impeded and so clouded as his.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weeks drifted by;&mdash;Harry Brierly flirted, danced, added lustre to
      the brilliant Senatorial receptions, and diligently &ldquo;buzzed&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;button-holed&rdquo; Congressmen in the interest of the Columbus River scheme;
      meantime Senator Dilworthy labored hard in the same interest&mdash;and in
      others of equal national importance. Harry wrote frequently to Sellers,
      and always encouragingly; and from these letters it was easy to see that
      Harry was a pet with all Washington, and was likely to carry the thing
      through; that the assistance rendered him by &ldquo;old Dilworthy&rdquo; was pretty
      fair&mdash;pretty fair; &ldquo;and every little helps, you know,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington wrote Sellers officially, now and then. In one of his letters
      it appeared that whereas no member of the House committee favored the
      scheme at first, there was now needed but one more vote to compass a
      majority report. Closing sentence:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <br /> &ldquo;Providence seems to further our efforts."<br /> (Signed,) &ldquo;ABNER
        DILWORTHY, U. S. S.,<br /> <br /> per WASHINGTON HAWKINS, P. S."<br />
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      At the end of a week, Washington was able to send the happy news,
      officially, as usual,&mdash;that the needed vote had been added and the
      bill favorably reported from the Committee. Other letters recorded its
      perils in Committee of the whole, and by and by its victory, by just the
      skin of its teeth, on third reading and final passage. Then came letters
      telling of Mr. Dilworthy&rsquo;s struggles with a stubborn majority in his own
      Committee in the Senate; of how these gentlemen succumbed, one by one,
      till a majority was secured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a hiatus. Washington watched every move on the board, and
      he was in a good position to do this, for he was clerk of this committee,
      and also one other. He received no salary as private secretary, but these
      two clerkships, procured by his benefactor, paid him an aggregate of
      twelve dollars a day, without counting the twenty percent extra
      compensation which would of course be voted to him on the last night of
      the session.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the bill go into Committee of the whole and struggle for its life
      again, and finally worry through. In the fullness of time he noted its
      second reading, and by and by the day arrived when the grand ordeal came,
      and it was put upon its final passage. Washington listened with bated
      breath to the &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; of the voters, for a few dread
      minutes, and then could bear the suspense no longer. He ran down from the
      gallery and hurried home to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of two or three hours the Senator arrived in the bosom of his
      family, and dinner was waiting. Washington sprang forward, with the eager
      question on his lips, and the Senator said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may rejoice freely, now, my son&mdash;Providence has crowned our
      efforts with success.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Washington sent grand good news to Col. Sellers that night. To Louise he
      wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is beautiful to hear him talk when his heart is full of thankfulness
      for some manifestation of the Divine favor. You shall know him, some day
      my Louise, and knowing him you will honor him, as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pulled it through, Colonel, but it was a tough job, there is no
      question about that. There was not a friend to the measure in the House
      committee when I began, and not a friend in the Senate committee except
      old Dil himself, but they were all fixed for a majority report when I
      hauled off my forces. Everybody here says you can&rsquo;t get a thing like this
      through Congress without buying committees for straight-out cash on
      delivery, but I think I&rsquo;ve taught them a thing or two&mdash;if I could
      only make them believe it. When I tell the old residenters that this thing
      went through without buying a vote or making a promise, they say, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
      rather too thin.&rsquo; And when I say thin or not thin it&rsquo;s a fact, anyway,
      they say, &lsquo;Come, now, but do you really believe that?&rsquo; and when I say I
      don&rsquo;t believe anything about it, I know it, they smile and say, &lsquo;Well, you
      are pretty innocent, or pretty blind, one or the other&mdash;there&rsquo;s no
      getting around that.&rsquo; Why they really do believe that votes have been
      bought&mdash;they do indeed. But let them keep on thinking so. I have
      found out that if a man knows how to talk to women, and has a little gift
      in the way of argument with men, he can afford to play for an
      appropriation against a money bag and give the money bag odds in the game.
      We&rsquo;ve raked in $200,000 of Uncle Sam&rsquo;s money, say what they will&mdash;and
      there is more where this came from, when we want it, and I rather fancy I
      am the person that can go in and occupy it, too, if I do say it myself,
      that shouldn&rsquo;t, perhaps. I&rsquo;ll be with you within a week. Scare up all the
      men you can, and put them to work at once. When I get there I propose to
      make things hum.&rdquo;

      The great news lifted Sellers into the clouds. He went to work on the
      instant. He flew hither and thither making contracts, engaging men, and
      steeping his soul in the ecstasies of business. He was the happiest man in
      Missouri. And Louise was the happiest woman; for presently came a letter
      from Washington which said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rejoice with me, for the long agony is over! We have waited patiently and
      faithfully, all these years, and now at last the reward is at hand. A man
      is to pay our family $40,000 for the Tennessee Land! It is but a little
      sum compared to what we could get by waiting, but I do so long to see the
      day when I can call you my own, that I have said to myself, better take
      this and enjoy life in a humble way than wear out our best days in this
      miserable separation. Besides, I can put this money into operations here
      that will increase it a hundred fold, yes, a thousand fold, in a few
      months. The air is full of such chances, and I know our family would
      consent in a moment that I should put in their shares with mine. Without a
      doubt we shall be worth half a million dollars in a year from this time&mdash;I
      put it at the very lowest figure, because it is always best to be on the
      safe side&mdash;half a million at the very lowest calculation, and then
      your father will give his consent and we can marry at last. Oh, that will
      be a glorious day. Tell our friends the good news&mdash;I want all to
      share it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she did tell her father and mother, but they said, let it be kept
      still for the present. The careful father also told her to write
      Washington and warn him not to speculate with the money, but to wait a
      little and advise with one or two wise old heads. She did this. And she
      managed to keep the good news to herself, though it would seem that the
      most careless observer might have seen by her springing step and her
      radiant countenance that some fine piece of good fortune had descended
      upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry joined the Colonel at Stone&rsquo;s Landing, and that dead place sprang
      into sudden life. A swarm of men were hard at work, and the dull air was
      filled with the cheery music of labor. Harry had been constituted
      engineer-in-general, and he threw the full strength of his powers into his
      work. He moved among his hirelings like a king. Authority seemed to invest
      him with a new splendor. Col. Sellers, as general superintendent of a
      great public enterprise, was all that a mere human being could be&mdash;and
      more. These two grandees went at their imposing &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; with the air
      of men who had been charged with the work of altering the foundations of
      the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned their first attention to straightening the river just above
      the Landing, where it made a deep bend, and where the maps and plans
      showed that the process of straightening would not only shorten distance
      but increase the &ldquo;fall.&rdquo; They started a cut-off canal across the peninsula
      formed by the bend, and such another tearing up of the earth and slopping
      around in the mud as followed the order to the men, had never been seen in
      that region before. There was such a panic among the turtles that at the
      end of six hours there was not one to be found within three miles of
      Stone&rsquo;s Landing. They took the young and the aged, the decrepit and the
      sick upon their backs and left for tide-water in disorderly procession,
      the tadpoles following and the bull-frogs bringing up the rear.

      Saturday night came, but the men were obliged to wait, because the
      appropriation had not come. Harry said he had written to hurry up the
      money and it would be along presently. So the work continued, on Monday.
      Stone&rsquo;s Landing was making quite a stir in the vicinity, by this time.
      Sellers threw a lot or two on the market, &ldquo;as a feeler,&rdquo; and they sold
      well. He re-clothed his family, laid in a good stock of provisions, and
      still had money left. He started a bank account, in a small way&mdash;and
      mentioned the deposit casually to friends; and to strangers, too; to
      everybody, in fact; but not as a new thing&mdash;on the contrary, as a
      matter of life-long standing. He could not keep from buying trifles every
      day that were not wholly necessary, it was such a gaudy thing to get out
      his bank-book and draw a check, instead of using his old customary
      formula, &ldquo;Charge it!&rdquo; Harry sold a lot or two, also&mdash;and had a dinner
      party or two at Hawkeye and a general good time with the money. Both men
      held on pretty strenuously for the coming big prices, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a month things were looking bad. Harry had besieged the New
      York headquarters of the Columbus River Slack-water Navigation Company
      with demands, then commands, and finally appeals, but to no purpose; the
      appropriation did not come; the letters were not even answered. The
      workmen were clamorous, now. The Colonel and Harry retired to consult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; said the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang&rsquo;d if I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Company say anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You telegraphed yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the day before, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None-confound them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a long pause. Finally both spoke at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the boys thirty-day orders on the Company for the back pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it-that&rsquo;s my own idea to a dot. But then&mdash;but then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said the Colonel; &ldquo;I know they can&rsquo;t wait for the orders to
      go to New York and be cashed, but what&rsquo;s the reason they can&rsquo;t get them
      discounted in Hawkeye?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course they can. That solves the difficulty. Everybody knows the
      appropriation&rsquo;s been made and the Company&rsquo;s perfectly good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the orders were given and the men appeased, though they grumbled a
      little at first. The orders went well enough for groceries and such things
      at a fair discount, and the work danced along gaily for a time. Two or
      three purchasers put up frame houses at the Landing and moved in, and of
      course a far-sighted but easy-going journeyman printer wandered along and
      started the &ldquo;Napoleon Weekly Telegraph and Literary Repository&rdquo;&mdash;a
      paper with a Latin motto from the Unabridged dictionary, and plenty of
      &ldquo;fat&rdquo; conversational tales and double-leaded poetry&mdash;all for two
      dollars a year, strictly in advance. Of course the merchants forwarded the
      orders at once to New York&mdash;and never heard of them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of some weeks Harry&rsquo;s orders were a drug in the market&mdash;nobody
      would take them at any discount whatever. The second month closed with a
      riot.&mdash;Sellers was absent at the time, and Harry began an active
      absence himself with the mob at his heels. But being on horseback, he had
      the advantage. He did not tarry in Hawkeye, but went on, thus missing
      several appointments with creditors. He was far on his flight eastward,
      and well out of danger when the next morning dawned. He telegraphed the
      Colonel to go down and quiet the laborers&mdash;he was bound east for
      money&mdash;everything would be right in a week&mdash;tell the men so&mdash;tell
      them to rely on him and not be afraid.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Sellers found the mob quiet enough when he reached the Landing. They had
      gutted the Navigation office, then piled the beautiful engraved
      stock-books and things in the middle of the floor and enjoyed the bonfire
      while it lasted. They had a liking for the Colonel, but still they had
      some idea of hanging him, as a sort of make-shift that might answer, after
      a fashion, in place of more satisfactory game.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p234" id="p234"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But they made the mistake of waiting to hear what he had to say first.
      Within fifteen minutes his tongue had done its work and they were all rich
      men.&mdash;He gave every one of them a lot in the suburbs of the city of
      Stone&rsquo;s Landing, within a mile and a half of the future post office and
      railway station, and they promised to resume work as soon as Harry got
      east and started the money along. Now things were blooming and pleasant
      again, but the men had no money, and nothing to live on. The Colonel
      divided with them the money he still had in bank&mdash;an act which had
      nothing surprising about it because he was generally ready to divide
      whatever he had with anybody that wanted it, and it was owing to this very
      trait that his family spent their days in poverty and at times were
      pinched with famine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the men&rsquo;s minds had cooled and Sellers was gone, they hated
      themselves for letting him beguile them with fine speeches, but it was too
      late, now&mdash;they agreed to hang him another time&mdash;such time as
      Providence should appoint.

    <p>
      Rumors of Ruth&rsquo;s frivolity and worldliness at Fallkill traveled to
      Philadelphia in due time, and occasioned no little undertalk among the
      Bolton relatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hannah Shoecraft told another cousin that, for her part, she never
      believed that Ruth had so much more &ldquo;mind&rdquo; than other people; and Cousin
      Hulda added that she always thought Ruth was fond of admiration, and that
      was the reason she was unwilling to wear plain clothes and attend Meeting.
      The story that Ruth was &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; to a young gentleman of fortune in
      Fallkill came with the other news, and helped to give point to the little
      satirical remarks that went round about Ruth&rsquo;s desire to be a doctor!
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Bolton was too wise to be either surprised or alarmed by these
      rumors. They might be true; she knew a woman&rsquo;s nature too well to think
      them improbable, but she also knew how steadfast Ruth was in her purposes,
      and that, as a brook breaks into ripples and eddies and dances and sports
      by the way, and yet keeps on to the sea, it was in Ruth&rsquo;s nature to give
      back cheerful answer to the solicitations of friendliness and pleasure, to
      appear idly delaying even, and sporting in the sunshine, while the current
      of her resolution flowed steadily on.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Ruth had this delight in the mere surface play of life that she
      could, for instance, be interested in that somewhat serious by-play called
      &ldquo;flirtation,&rdquo; or take any delight in the exercise of those little arts of
      pleasing and winning which are none the less genuine and charming because
      they are not intellectual, Ruth, herself, had never suspected until she
      went to Fallkill. She had believed it her duty to subdue her gaiety of
      temperament, and let nothing divert her from what are called serious
      pursuits: In her limited experience she brought everything to the judgment
      of her own conscience, and settled the affairs of all the world in her own
      serene judgment hall. Perhaps her mother saw this, and saw also that there
      was nothing in the Friends&rsquo; society to prevent her from growing more and
      more opinionated.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ruth returned to Philadelphia, it must be confessed&mdash;though it
      would not have been by her&mdash;that a medical career did seem a little
      less necessary for her than formerly; and coming back in a glow of
      triumph, as it were, and in the consciousness of the freedom and life in a
      lively society and in new and sympathetic friendship, she anticipated
      pleasure in an attempt to break up the stiffness and levelness of the
      society at home, and infusing into it something of the motion and sparkle
      which were so agreeable at Fallkill. She expected visits from her new
      friends, she would have company, the new books and the periodicals about
      which all the world was talking, and, in short, she would have life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a little while she lived in this atmosphere which she had brought with
      her. Her mother was delighted with this change in her, with the
      improvement in her health and the interest she exhibited in home affairs.
      Her father enjoyed the society of his favorite daughter as he did few
      things besides; he liked her mirthful and teasing ways, and not less a
      keen battle over something she had read. He had been a great reader all
      his life, and a remarkable memory had stored his mind with encyclopaedic
      information. It was one of Ruth&rsquo;s delights to cram herself with some out
      of the way subject and endeavor to catch her father; but she almost always
      failed. Mr. Bolton liked company, a house full of it, and the mirth of
      young people, and he would have willingly entered into any revolutionary
      plans Ruth might have suggested in relation to Friends&rsquo; society.
    </p>
    <p>
      But custom and the fixed order are stronger than the most enthusiastic and
      rebellious young lady, as Ruth very soon found. In spite of all her brave
      efforts, her frequent correspondence, and her determined animation, her
      books and her music, she found herself settling into the clutches of the
      old monotony, and as she realized the hopelessness of her endeavors, the
      medical scheme took new hold of her, and seemed to her the only method of
      escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, thee does not know how different it is in Fallkill, how much more
      interesting the people are one meets, how much more life there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But thee will find the world, child, pretty much all the same, when thee
      knows it better. I thought once as thee does now, and had as little
      thought of being a Friend as thee has. Perhaps when thee has seen more,
      thee will better appreciate a quiet life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thee married young. I shall not marry young, and perhaps not at all,&rdquo;
       said Ruth, with a look of vast experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps thee doesn&rsquo;t know thee own mind; I have known persons of thy age
      who did not. Did thee see anybody whom thee would like to live with always
      in Fallkill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not always,&rdquo; replied Ruth with a little laugh. &ldquo;Mother, I think I
      wouldn&rsquo;t say &lsquo;always&rsquo; to any one until I have a profession and am as
      independent as he is. Then my love would be a free act, and not in any way
      a necessity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret Bolton smiled at this new-fangled philosophy. &ldquo;Thee will find
      that love, Ruth, is a thing thee won&rsquo;t reason about, when it comes, nor
      make any bargains about. Thee wrote that Philip Sterling was at Fallkill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and Henry Brierly, a friend of his; a very amusing young fellow and
      not so serious-minded as Philip, but a bit of a fop maybe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thee preferred the fop to the serious-minded?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t prefer anybody; but Henry Brierly was good company, which Philip
      wasn&rsquo;t always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did thee know thee father had been in correspondence with Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth looked up surprised and with a plain question in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not about thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then?&rdquo; and if there was any shade of disappointment in her tone,
      probably Ruth herself did not know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about some land up in the country. That man Bigler has got father
      into another speculation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That odious man! Why will father have anything to do with him? Is it that
      railroad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Father advanced money and took land as security, and whatever has
      gone with the money and the bonds, he has on his hands a large tract of
      wild land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what has Philip to do with that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has good timber, if it could ever be got out, and father says that
      there must be coal in it; it&rsquo;s in a coal region. He wants Philip to survey
      it, and examine it for indications of coal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s another of father&rsquo;s fortunes, I suppose,&rdquo; said Ruth. &ldquo;He has put
      away so many fortunes for us that I&rsquo;m afraid we never shall find them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth was interested in it nevertheless, and perhaps mainly because Philip
      was to be connected with the enterprise. Mr. Bigler came to dinner with
      her father next day, and talked a great deal about Mr. Bolton&rsquo;s
      magnificent tract of land, extolled the sagacity that led him to secure
      such a property, and led the talk along to another railroad which would
      open a northern communication to this very land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pennybacker says it&rsquo;s full of coal, he&rsquo;s no doubt of it, and a railroad
      to strike the Erie would make it a fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you take the land and work the thing up, Mr. Bigler; you may have
      the tract for three dollars an acre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d throw it away, then,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bigler, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not the man to
      take advantage of a friend. But if you&rsquo;ll put a mortgage on it for the
      northern road, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind taking an interest, if Pennybacker is
      willing; but Pennybacker, you know, don&rsquo;t go much on land, he sticks to
      the legislature.&rdquo; And Mr. Bigler laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Bigler had gone, Ruth asked her father about Philip&rsquo;s connection
      with the land scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing definite,&rdquo; said Mr. Bolton. &ldquo;Philip is showing aptitude
      for his profession. I hear the best reports of him in New York, though
      those sharpers don&rsquo;t intend to do anything but use him. I&rsquo;ve written and
      offered him employment in surveying and examining the land. We want to
      know what it is. And if there is anything in it that his enterprise can
      dig out, he shall have an interest. I should be glad to give the young
      fellow a lift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All his life Eli Bolton had been giving young fellows a lift, and
      shouldering the loses when things turned out unfortunately. His ledger,
      take-it-altogether, would not show a balance on the right side; but
      perhaps the losses on his books will turn out to be credits in a world
      where accounts are kept on a different basis. The left hand of the ledger
      will appear the right, looked at from the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip, wrote to Ruth rather a comical account of the bursting up of the
      city of Napoleon and the navigation improvement scheme, of Harry&rsquo;s flight
      and the Colonel&rsquo;s discomfiture. Harry left in such a hurry that he hadn&rsquo;t
      even time to bid Miss Laura Hawkins good-bye, but he had no doubt that
      Harry would console himself with the next pretty face he saw&mdash;a
      remark which was thrown in for Ruth&rsquo;s benefit. Col. Sellers had in all
      probability, by this time, some other equally brilliant speculation in his
      brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the railroad, Philip had made up his mind that it was merely kept on
      foot for speculative purposes in Wall street, and he was about to quit it.
      Would Ruth be glad to hear, he wondered, that he was coming East? For he
      was coming, in spite of a letter from Harry in New York, advising him to
      hold on until he had made some arrangements in regard to contracts, he to
      be a little careful about Sellers, who was somewhat visionary, Harry said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer went on without much excitement for Ruth. She kept up a
      correspondence with Alice, who promised a visit in the fall, she read, she
      earnestly tried to interest herself in home affairs and such people as
      came to the house; but she found herself falling more and more into
      reveries, and growing weary of things as they were. She felt that
      everybody might become in time like two relatives from a Shaker
      establishment in Ohio, who visited the Boltons about this time, a father
      and son, clad exactly alike, and alike in manners. The son; however, who
      was not of age, was more unworldly and sanctimonious than his father; he
      always addressed his parent as &ldquo;Brother Plum,&rdquo; and bore himself,
      altogether in such a superior manner that Ruth longed to put bent pins in
      his chair. Both father and son wore the long, single breasted collarless
      coats of their society, without buttons, before or behind, but with a row
      of hooks and eyes on either side in front. It was Ruth&rsquo;s suggestion that
      the coats would be improved by a single hook and eye sewed on in the small
      of the back where the buttons usually are.

    </p>
    <p>
      Amusing as this Shaker caricature of the Friends was, it oppressed Ruth
      beyond measure; and increased her feeling of being stifled.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a most unreasonable feeling. No home could be pleasanter than
      Ruth&rsquo;s. The house, a little out of the city; was one of those elegant
      country residences which so much charm visitors to the suburbs of
      Philadelphia. A modern dwelling and luxurious in everything that wealth
      could suggest for comfort, it stood in the midst of exquisitely kept
      lawns, with groups of trees, parterres of flowers massed in colors, with
      greenhouse, grapery and garden; and on one side, the garden sloped away in
      undulations to a shallow brook that ran over a pebbly bottom and sang
      under forest trees. The country about was the perfection of cultivated
      landscape, dotted with cottages, and stately mansions of Revolutionary
      date, and sweet as an English country-side, whether seen in the soft bloom
      of May or in the mellow ripeness of late October.

    <p>
      It needed only the peace of the mind within, to make it a paradise. One
      riding by on the Old Germantown road, and seeing a young girl swinging in
      the hammock on the piazza and, intent upon some volume of old poetry or
      the latest novel, would no doubt have envied a life so idyllic. He could
      not have imagined that the young girl was reading a volume of reports of
      clinics and longing to be elsewhere.
    </p>

      Ruth could not have been more discontented if all the wealth about her had
      been as unsubstantial as a dream. Perhaps she so thought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; she once said to her father, &ldquo;as if I were living in a house of
      cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thee would like to turn it into a hospital?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. But tell me father,&rdquo; continued Ruth, not to be put off, &ldquo;is thee
      still going on with that Bigler and those other men who come here and
      entice thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bolton smiled, as men do when they talk with women about &ldquo;business&rdquo;.
      &ldquo;Such men have their uses, Ruth. They keep the world active, and I owe a
      great many of my best operations to such men. Who knows, Ruth, but this
      new land purchase, which I confess I yielded a little too much to Bigler
      in, may not turn out a fortune for thee and the rest of the children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, father, thee sees every thing in a rose-colored light. I do believe
      thee wouldn&rsquo;t have so readily allowed me to begin the study of medicine,
      if it hadn&rsquo;t had the novelty of an experiment to thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is thee satisfied with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If thee means, if I have had enough of it, no. I just begin to see what I
      can do in it, and what a noble profession it is for a woman. Would thee
      have me sit here like a bird on a bough and wait for somebody to come and
      put me in a cage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bolton was not sorry to divert the talk from his own affairs, and he
      did not think it worth while to tell his family of a performance that very
      day which was entirely characteristic of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth might well say that she felt as if she were living in a house of
      cards, although the Bolton household had no idea of the number of perils
      that hovered over them, any more than thousands of families in America
      have of the business risks and contingences upon which their prosperity
      and luxury hang.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden call upon Mr. Bolton for a large sum of money, which must be
      forthcoming at once, had found him in the midst of a dozen ventures, from
      no one of which a dollar could be realized. It was in vain that he applied
      to his business acquaintances and friends; it was a period of sudden panic
      and no money. &ldquo;A hundred thousand! Mr. Bolton,&rdquo; said Plumly. &ldquo;Good God, if
      you should ask me for ten, I shouldn&rsquo;t know where to get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And yet that day Mr. Small (Pennybacker, Bigler and Small) came to Mr.
      Bolton with a piteous story of ruin in a coal operation, if he could not
      raise ten thousand dollars. Only ten, and he was sure of a fortune.
      Without it he was a beggar. Mr. Bolton had already Small&rsquo;s notes for a
      large amount in his safe, labeled &ldquo;doubtful;&rdquo; he had helped him again and
      again, and always with the same result. But Mr. Small spoke with a
      faltering voice of his family, his daughter in school, his wife ignorant
      of his calamity, and drew such a picture of their agony, that Mr. Bolton
      put by his own more pressing necessity, and devoted the day to scraping
      together, here and there, ten thousand dollars for this brazen beggar, who
      had never kept a promise to him nor paid a debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful credit! The foundation of modern society. Who shall say that
      this is not the golden age of mutual trust, of unlimited reliance upon
      human promises? That is a peculiar condition of society which enables a
      whole nation to instantly recognize point and meaning in the familiar
      newspaper anecdote, which puts into the mouth of a distinguished
      speculator in lands and mines this remark:&mdash;&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t worth a cent
      two years ago, and now I owe two millions of dollars.&rdquo;

      It was a hard blow to poor Sellers to see the work on his darling
      enterprise stop, and the noise and bustle and confusion that had been such
      refreshment to his soul, sicken and die out. It was hard to come down to
      humdrum ordinary life again after being a General Superintendent and the
      most conspicuous man in the community. It was sad to see his name
      disappear from the newspapers; sadder still to see it resurrected at
      intervals, shorn of its aforetime gaudy gear of compliments and clothed on
      with rhetorical tar and feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his friends suffered more on his account than he did. He was a cork
      that could not be kept under the water many moments at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to bolster up his wife&rsquo;s spirits every now and then. On one of
      these occasions he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, my dear, all right; it will all come right in a little
      while. There&rsquo;s $200,000 coming, and that will set things booming again:
      Harry seems to be having some difficulty, but that&rsquo;s to be expected&mdash;you
      can&rsquo;t move these big operations to the tune of Fisher&rsquo;s Hornpipe, you
      know. But Harry will get it started along presently, and then you&rsquo;ll see!
      I expect the news every day now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Beriah, you&rsquo;ve been expecting it every day, all along, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes; yes&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know but I have. But anyway, the longer it&rsquo;s
      delayed, the nearer it grows to the time when it will start&mdash;same as
      every day you live brings you nearer to&mdash;nearer&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The grave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no&mdash;not that exactly; but you can&rsquo;t understand these things,
      Polly dear&mdash;women haven&rsquo;t much head for business, you know. You make
      yourself perfectly comfortable, old lady, and you&rsquo;ll see how we&rsquo;ll trot
      this right along. Why bless you, let the appropriation lag, if it wants to&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      no great matter&mdash;there&rsquo;s a bigger thing than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bigger than $200,000, Beriah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bigger, child?&mdash;why, what&rsquo;s $200,000? Pocket money! Mere pocket
      money! Look at the railroad! Did you forget the railroad? It ain&rsquo;t many
      months till spring; it will be coming right along, and the railroad
      swimming right along behind it. Where&rsquo;ll it be by the middle of summer?
      Just stop and fancy a moment&mdash;just think a little&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      anything suggest itself? Bless your heart, you dear women live right in
      the present all the time&mdash;but a man, why a man lives&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the future, Beriah? But don&rsquo;t we live in the future most too much,
      Beriah? We do somehow seem to manage to live on next year&rsquo;s crop of corn
      and potatoes as a general thing while this year is still dragging along,
      but sometimes it&rsquo;s not a robust diet,&mdash;Beriah. But don&rsquo;t look that
      way, dear&mdash;don&rsquo;t mind what I say. I don&rsquo;t mean to fret, I don&rsquo;t mean
      to worry; and I don&rsquo;t, once a month, do I, dear? But when I get a little
      low and feel bad, I get a bit troubled and worrisome, but it don&rsquo;t mean
      anything in the world. It passes right away. I know you&rsquo;re doing all you
      can, and I don&rsquo;t want to seem repining and ungrateful&mdash;for I&rsquo;m not,
      Beriah&mdash;you know I&rsquo;m not, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless you, child, I know you are the very best little woman that
      ever lived&mdash;that ever lived on the whole face of the Earth! And I
      know that I would be a dog not to work for you and think for you and
      scheme for you with all my might. And I&rsquo;ll bring things all right yet,
      honey&mdash;cheer up and don&rsquo;t you fear. The railroad&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I had forgotten the railroad, dear, but when a body gets blue, a body
      forgets everything. Yes, the railroad&mdash;tell me about the railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha, my girl, don&rsquo;t you see? Things ain&rsquo;t so dark, are they? Now I didn&rsquo;t
      forget the railroad. Now just think for a moment&mdash;just figure up a
      little on the future dead moral certainties. For instance, call this
      waiter St. Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll lay this fork (representing the railroad) from St. Louis to
      this potato, which is Slouchburg:

    <p>
      &ldquo;Then with this carving knife we&rsquo;ll continue the railroad from Slouchburg
      to Doodleville, shown by the black pepper:

    <p>
      &ldquo;Thence to Hail Columbia&mdash;snuffers, Polly, please move that cup and
      saucer close up, that&rsquo;s Hail Columbia:

      &ldquo;Then&mdash;let me open my knife&mdash;to Hark-from-the-Tomb, where we&rsquo;ll

      Hark-from-the-Tomb&mdash;down-grade all the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there we strike Columbus River&mdash;pass me two or three skeins of
      thread to stand for the river; the sugar bowl will do for Hawkeye, and the
      rat trap for Stone&rsquo;s Landing&mdash;Napoleon, I mean&mdash;and you can see
      how much better Napoleon is located than Hawkeye. Now here you are with
      your railroad complete, and showing its continuation to Hallelujah and
      thence to Corruptionville.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then&mdash;there you are! It&rsquo;s a beautiful road, beautiful. Jeff
      Thompson can out-engineer any civil engineer that ever sighted through an
      aneroid, or a theodolite, or whatever they call it&mdash;he calls it
      sometimes one and sometimes the other just whichever levels off his
      sentence neatest, I reckon. But ain&rsquo;t it a ripping road, though? I tell
      you, it&rsquo;ll make a stir when it gets along. Just see what a country it goes
      through. There&rsquo;s your onions at Slouchburg&mdash;noblest onion country
      that graces God&rsquo;s footstool; and there&rsquo;s your turnip country all around
      Doodleville&mdash;bless my life, what fortunes are going to be made there
      when they get that contrivance perfected for extracting olive oil out of
      turnips&mdash;if there&rsquo;s any in them; and I reckon there is, because
      Congress has made an appropriation of money to test the thing, and they
      wouldn&rsquo;t have done that just on conjecture, of course. And now we come to
      the Brimstone region&mdash;cattle raised there till you can&rsquo;t rest&mdash;and
      corn, and all that sort of thing. Then you&rsquo;ve got a little stretch along
      through Belshazzar that don&rsquo;t produce anything now&mdash;at least nothing
      but rocks&mdash;but irrigation will fetch it. Then from Catfish to Babylon
      it&rsquo;s a little swampy, but there&rsquo;s dead loads of peat down under there
      somewhere. Next is the Bloody Run and Hail Columbia country&mdash;tobacco
      enough can be raised there to support two such railroads. Next is the
      sassparilla region. I reckon there&rsquo;s enough of that truck along in there
      on the line of the pocket-knife, from Hail Columbia to Hark-from-the Tomb
      to fat up all the consumptives in all the hospitals from Halifax to the
      Holy Land. It just grows like weeds! I&rsquo;ve got a little belt of sassparilla
      land in there just tucked away unobstrusively waiting for my little
      Universal Expectorant to get into shape in my head. And I&rsquo;ll fix that, you
      know. One of these days I&rsquo;ll have all the nations of the earth expecto&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Beriah, dear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me; Polly&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want you to lose the run of the
      map&mdash;well, take your toy-horse, James Fitz-James, if you must have it&mdash;and
      run along with you. Here, now&mdash;the soap will do for Babylon. Let me
      see&mdash;where was I? Oh yes&mdash;now we run down to Stone&rsquo;s Lan&mdash;Napoleon&mdash;now
      we run down to Napoleon. Beautiful road. Look at that, now. Perfectly
      straight line-straight as the way to the grave.

      And see where it leaves Hawkeye-clear out in the cold, my dear, clear out
      in the cold. That town&rsquo;s as bound to die as&mdash;well if I owned it I&rsquo;d
      get its obituary ready, now, and notify the mourners. Polly, mark my words&mdash;in
      three years from this, Hawkeye&rsquo;ll be a howling wilderness. You&rsquo;ll see. And
      just look at that river&mdash;noblest stream that meanders over the
      thirsty earth!&mdash;calmest, gentlest artery that refreshes her weary
      bosom! Railroad goes all over it and all through it&mdash;wades right
      along on stilts. Seventeen bridges in three miles and a half&mdash;forty-nine
      bridges from Hark-from-the-Tomb to Stone&rsquo;s Landing altogether&mdash;forty
      nine bridges, and culverts enough to culvert creation itself! Hadn&rsquo;t
      skeins of thread enough to represent them all&mdash;but you get an idea&mdash;perfect
      trestle-work of bridges for seventy two miles: Jeff Thompson and I fixed
      all that, you know; he&rsquo;s to get the contracts and I&rsquo;m to put them through
      on the divide. Just oceans of money in those bridges. It&rsquo;s the only part
      of the railroad I&rsquo;m interested in,&mdash;down along the line&mdash;and
      it&rsquo;s all I want, too. It&rsquo;s enough, I should judge. Now here we are at
      Napoleon. Good enough country plenty good enough&mdash;all it wants is
      population. That&rsquo;s all right&mdash;that will come. And it&rsquo;s no bad country
      now for calmness and solitude, I can tell you&mdash;though there&rsquo;s no
      money in that, of course. No money, but a man wants rest, a man wants
      peace&mdash;a man don&rsquo;t want to rip and tear around all the time. And here
      we go, now, just as straight as a string for Hallelujah&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
      beautiful angle&mdash;handsome up grade all the way&mdash;and then away
      you go to Corruptionville, the gaudiest country for early carrots and
      cauliflowers that ever&mdash;good missionary field, too. There ain&rsquo;t such
      another missionary field outside the jungles of Central Africa. And
      patriotic?&mdash;why they named it after Congress itself. Oh, I warn you,
      my dear, there&rsquo;s a good time coming, and it&rsquo;ll be right along before you
      know what you&rsquo;re about, too. That railroad&rsquo;s fetching it. You see what it
      is as far as I&rsquo;ve got, and if I had enough bottles and soap and boot-jacks
      and such things to carry it along to where it joins onto the Union
      Pacific, fourteen hundred miles from here, I should exhibit to you in that
      little internal improvement a spectacle of inconceivable sublimity. So,
      don&rsquo;t you see? We&rsquo;ve got the rail road to fall back on; and in the
      meantime, what are we worrying about that $200,000 appropriation for?
      That&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;d be willing to bet anything that the very next letter
      that comes from Harry will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eldest boy entered just in the nick of time and brought a letter, warm
      from the post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Things do look bright, after all, Beriah. I&rsquo;m sorry I was blue, but it

      Whatever may have been the language of Harry&rsquo;s letter to the Colonel, the
      information it conveyed was condensed or expanded, one or the other, from
      the following episode of his visit to New York:
    </p>
    <p>
      He called, with official importance in his mien, at No.&mdash; Wall
      street, where a great gilt sign betokened the presence of the
      head-quarters of the &ldquo;Columbus River Slack-Water Navigation Company.&rdquo; He
      entered and gave a dressy porter his card, and was requested to wait a
      moment in a sort of ante-room. The porter returned in a minute; and asked
      whom he would like to see?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The president of the company, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is busy with some gentlemen, sir; says he will be done with them
      directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That a copper-plate card with &ldquo;Engineer-in-Chief&rdquo; on it should be received
      with such tranquility as this, annoyed Mr. Brierly not a little. But he
      had to submit. Indeed his annoyance had time to augment a good deal; for
      he was allowed to cool his heels a full half hour in the ante-room before
      those gentlemen emerged and he was ushered into the presence. He found a
      stately dignitary occupying a very official chair behind a long green
      morocco-covered table, in a room sumptuously carpeted and furnished, and
      well garnished with pictures.

      &ldquo;We perceive by your reports and the reports of the Chief Superintendent,

    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, very well then. Now we begin to understand each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see that we do. There&rsquo;s two months&rsquo; wages due the men, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How? Haven&rsquo;t you paid the men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paid them! How are we going to pay them when you don&rsquo;t honor our drafts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, my dear sir, I cannot see how you can find any fault with us. I am
      sure we have acted in a perfectly straight forward business way.&mdash;Now
      let us look at the thing a moment. You subscribed for 100 shares of the
      capital stock, at $1,000 a share, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mr. Sellers took a like amount?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. No concern can get along without money. We levied a ten per
      cent. assessment. It was the original understanding that you and Mr.
      Sellers were to have the positions you now hold, with salaries of $600 a
      month each, while in active service. You were duly elected to these
      places, and you accepted them. Am I right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. You were given your instructions and put to work. By your
      reports it appears that you have expended the sum of $9,610 upon the said
      work. Two months salary to you two officers amounts altogether to $2,400&mdash;about
      one-eighth of your ten per cent. assessment, you see; which leaves you in
      debt to the company for the other seven-eighths of the assessment&mdash;viz,
      something over $8,000 apiece. Now instead of requiring you to forward this
      aggregate of $16,000 or $17,000 to New York, the company voted unanimously
      to let you pay it over to the contractors, laborers from time to time, and
      give you credit on the books for it. And they did it without a murmur,
      too, for they were pleased with the progress you had made, and were glad
      to pay you that little compliment&mdash;and a very neat one it was, too, I
      am sure. The work you did fell short of $10,000, a trifle. Let me see&mdash;$9,640
      from $20,000&mdash;salary $2,400 added&mdash;ah yes, the balance due the
      company from yourself and Mr. Sellers is $7,960, which I will take the
      responsibility of allowing to stand for the present, unless you prefer to
      draw a check now, and thus&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, do you mean to say that instead of the company owing us
      $2,400, we owe the company $7,960?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that we owe the men and the contractors nearly ten thousand dollars
      besides?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Owe them! Oh bless my soul, you can&rsquo;t mean that you have not paid these
      people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do mean it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president rose and walked the floor like a man in bodily pain. His
      brows contracted, he put his hand up and clasped his forehead, and kept
      saying, &ldquo;Oh, it is, too bad, too bad, too bad! Oh, it is bound to be found
      out&mdash;nothing can prevent it&mdash;nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he threw himself into his chair and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Brierson, this is dreadful&mdash;perfectly dreadful. It will
      be found out. It is bound to tarnish the good name of the company; our
      credit will be seriously, most seriously impaired. How could you be so
      thoughtless&mdash;the men ought to have been paid though it beggared us
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They ought, ought they? Then why the devil&mdash;my name is not Bryerson,
      by the way&mdash;why the mischief didn&rsquo;t the compa&mdash;why what in the
      nation ever became of the appropriation? Where is that appropriation?&mdash;if
      a stockholder may make so bold as to ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The appropriation?&mdash;that paltry $200,000, do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t know that $200,000 was so very paltry.
      Though I grant, of course, that it is not a large sum, strictly speaking.
      But where is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, you surprise me. You surely cannot have had a large
      acquaintance with this sort of thing. Otherwise you would not have
      expected much of a result from a mere INITIAL appropriation like that. It
      was never intended for anything but a mere nest egg for the future and
      real appropriations to cluster around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? Well, was it a myth, or was it a reality? Whatever become of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the&mdash;matter is simple enough. A Congressional appropriation
      costs money. Just reflect, for instance&mdash;a majority of the House
      Committee, say $10,000 apiece&mdash;$40,000; a majority of the Senate
      Committee, the same each&mdash;say $40,000; a little extra to one or two
      chairman of one or two such committees, say $10,000 each&mdash;$20,000;
      and there&rsquo;s $100,000 of the money gone, to begin with. Then, seven male
      lobbyists, at $3,000 each&mdash;$21,000; one female lobbyist, $10,000; a
      high moral Congressman or Senator here and there&mdash;the high moral ones
      cost more, because they. give tone to a measure&mdash;say ten of these at
      $3,000 each, is $30,000; then a lot of small-fry country members who won&rsquo;t
      vote for anything whatever without pay&mdash;say twenty at $500 apiece, is
      $10,000; a lot of dinners to members&mdash;say $10,000 altogether; lot of
      jimcracks for Congressmen&rsquo;s wives and children&mdash;those go a long way&mdash;you
      can&rsquo;t spend too much money in that line&mdash;well, those things cost in a
      lump, say $10,000&mdash;along there somewhere; and then comes your printed
      documents&mdash;your maps, your tinted engravings, your pamphlets, your
      illuminated show cards, your advertisements in a hundred and fifty papers
      at ever so much a line&mdash;because you&rsquo;ve got to keep the papers all
      right or you are gone up, you know. Oh, my dear sir, printing bills are
      destruction itself. Ours so far amount to&mdash;let me see&mdash;10; 52;
      22; 13;&mdash;and then there&rsquo;s 11; 14; 33&mdash;well, never mind the
      details, the total in clean numbers foots up $118,254.42 thus far!&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes indeed. Printing&rsquo;s no bagatelle, I can tell you. And then there&rsquo;s
      your contributions, as a company, to Chicago fires and Boston fires, and
      orphan asylums and all that sort of thing&mdash;head the list, you see,
      with the company&rsquo;s full name and a thousand dollars set opposite&mdash;great
      card, sir&mdash;one of the finest advertisements in the world&mdash;the
      preachers mention it in the pulpit when it&rsquo;s a religious charity&mdash;one
      of the happiest advertisements in the world is your benevolent donation.
      Ours have amounted to sixteen thousand dollars and some cents up to this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Perhaps the biggest thing we&rsquo;ve done in the advertising line was
      to get an officer of the U. S. government, of perfectly Himmalayan
      official altitude, to write up our little internal improvement for a
      religious paper of enormous circulation&mdash;I tell you that makes our
      bonds go handsomely among the pious poor. Your religious paper is by far
      the best vehicle for a thing of this kind, because they&rsquo;ll &lsquo;lead&rsquo; your
      article and put it right in the midst of the reading matter; and if it&rsquo;s
      got a few Scripture quotations in it, and some temperance platitudes and a
      bit of gush here and there about Sunday Schools, and a sentimental snuffle
      now and then about &lsquo;God&rsquo;s precious ones, the honest hard-handed poor,&rsquo; it
      works the nation like a charm, my dear sir, and never a man suspects that
      it is an advertisement; but your secular paper sticks you right into the
      advertising columns and of course you don&rsquo;t take a trick. Give me a
      religious paper to advertise in, every time; and if you&rsquo;ll just look at
      their advertising pages, you&rsquo;ll observe that other people think a good
      deal as I do&mdash;especially people who have got little financial schemes
      to make everybody rich with. Of course I mean your great big metropolitan
      religious papers that know how to serve God and make money at the same
      time&mdash;that&rsquo;s your sort, sir, that&rsquo;s your sort&mdash;a religious paper
      that isn&rsquo;t run to make money is no use to us, sir, as an advertising
      medium&mdash;no use to anybody&mdash;in our line of business. I guess our
      next best dodge was sending a pleasure trip of newspaper reporters out to
      Napoleon. Never paid them a cent; just filled them up with champagne and
      the fat of the land, put pen, ink and paper before them while they were
      red-hot, and bless your soul when you come to read their letters you&rsquo;d
      have supposed they&rsquo;d been to heaven. And if a sentimental squeamishness
      held one or two of them back from taking a less rosy view of Napoleon, our
      hospitalities tied his tongue, at least, and he said nothing at all and so
      did us no harm. Let me see&mdash;have I stated all the expenses I&rsquo;ve been
      at? No, I was near forgetting one or two items. There&rsquo;s your official
      salaries&mdash;you can&rsquo;t get good men for nothing. Salaries cost pretty
      lively. And then there&rsquo;s your big high-sounding millionaire names stuck
      into your advertisements as stockholders&mdash;another card, that&mdash;and
      they are stockholders, too, but you have to give them the stock and
      non-assessable at that&mdash;so they&rsquo;re an expensive lot. Very, very
      expensive thing, take it all around, is a big internal improvement concern&mdash;but
      you see that yourself, Mr. Bryerman&mdash;you see that, yourself, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But look here. I think you are a little mistaken about it&rsquo;s ever having
      cost anything for Congressional votes. I happen to know something about
      that. I&rsquo;ve let you say your say&mdash;now let me say mine. I don&rsquo;t wish to
      seem to throw any suspicion on anybody&rsquo;s statements, because we are all
      liable to be mistaken. But how would it strike you if I were to say that I
      was in Washington all the time this bill was pending? and what if I added
      that I put the measure through myself? Yes, sir, I did that little thing.
      And moreover, I never paid a dollar for any man&rsquo;s vote and never promised
      one. There are some ways of doing a thing that are as good as others which
      other people don&rsquo;t happen to think about, or don&rsquo;t have the knack of
      succeeding in, if they do happen to think of them. My dear sir, I am
      obliged to knock some of your expenses in the head&mdash;for never a cent
      was paid a Congressman or Senator on the part of this Navigation Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president smiled blandly, even sweetly, all through this harangue, and
      then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every word of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well it does seem to alter the complexion of things a little. You are
      acquainted with the members down there, of course, else you could not have
      worked to such advantage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know them all, sir. I know their wives, their children, their babies&mdash;I
      even made it a point to be on good terms with their lackeys. I know every
      Congressman well&mdash;even familiarly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good. Do you know any of their signatures? Do you know their
      handwriting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I know their handwriting as well as I know my own&mdash;have had
      correspondence enough with them, I should think. And their signatures&mdash;why
      I can tell their initials, even.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president went to a private safe, unlocked it and got out some letters
      and certain slips of paper. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now here, for instance; do you believe that that is a genuine letter? Do
      you know this signature here?&mdash;and this one? Do you know who those
      initials represent&mdash;and are they forgeries?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry was stupefied. There were things there that made his brain swim.
      Presently, at the bottom of one of the letters he saw a signature that
      restored his equilibrium; it even brought the sunshine of a smile to his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The president said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That one amuses you. You never suspected him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I ought to have suspected him, but I don&rsquo;t believe it ever
      really occurred to me. Well, well, well&mdash;how did you ever have the
      nerve to approach him, of all others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why my friend, we never think of accomplishing anything without his help.
      He is our mainstay. But how do those letters strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They strike me dumb! What a stone-blind idiot I have been!&rdquo;

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take it all around, I suppose you had a pleasant time in
      Washington,&rdquo; said the president, gathering up the letters; &ldquo;of course you
      must have had. Very few men could go there and get a money bill through
      without buying a single&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, now, Mr. President, that&rsquo;s plenty of that! I take back everything I
      said on that head. I&rsquo;m a wiser man to-day than I was yesterday, I can tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are. In fact I am satisfied you are. But now I showed you
      these things in confidence, you understand. Mention facts as much as you
      want to, but don&rsquo;t mention names to anybody. I can depend on you for that,
      can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course. I understand the necessity of that. I will not betray the
      names. But to go back a bit, it begins to look as if you never saw any of
      that appropriation at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We saw nearly ten thousand dollars of it&mdash;and that was all. Several
      of us took turns at log-rolling in Washington, and if we had charged
      anything for that service, none of that $10,000 would ever have reached
      New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t levied the assessment you would have been in a close place
      I judge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Close? Have you figured up the total of the disbursements I told you of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t think of that.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;Bother the appropriations. They cost more than they come to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the next one. We&rsquo;ll call for half a million&mdash;get it and go for a
      million the very next month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the cost of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The president smiled, and patted his secret letters affectionately. He
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these people are in the next Congress. We shan&rsquo;t have to pay them a
      cent. And what is more, they will work like beavers for us&mdash;perhaps
      it might be to their advantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry reflected profoundly a while. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We send many missionaries to lift up the benighted races of other lands.
      How much cheaper and better it would be if those people could only come
      here and drink of our civilization at its fountain head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I perfectly agree with you, Mr. Beverly. Must you go? Well, good morning.
      Look in, when you are passing; and whenever I can give you any information
      about our affairs and prospects, I shall be glad to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry&rsquo;s letter was not a long one, but it contained at least the
      calamitous figures that came out in the above conversation. The Colonel
      found himself in a rather uncomfortable place&mdash;no $1,200 salary
      forthcoming; and himself held responsible for half of the $9,640 due the
      workmen, to say nothing of being in debt to the company to the extent of
      nearly $4,000. Polly&rsquo;s heart was nearly broken; the &ldquo;blues&rdquo; returned in
      fearful force, and she had to go out of the room to hide the tears that
      nothing could keep back now.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was mourning in another quarter, too, for Louise had a letter.
      Washington had refused, at the last moment, to take $40,000 for the
      Tennessee Land, and had demanded $150,000! So the trade fell through, and
      now Washington was wailing because he had been so foolish. But he wrote
      that his man might probably return to the city soon, and then he meant to
      sell to him, sure, even if he had to take $10,000. Louise had a good cry&mdash;several
      of them, indeed&mdash;and the family charitably forebore to make any
      comments that would increase her grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spring blossomed, summer came, dragged its hot weeks by, and the Colonel&rsquo;s
      spirits rose, day by day, for the railroad was making good progress. But
      by and by something happened. Hawkeye had always declined to subscribe
      anything toward the railway, imagining that her large business would be a
      sufficient compulsory influence; but now Hawkeye was frightened; and
      before Col. Sellers knew what he was about, Hawkeye, in a panic, had
      rushed to the front and subscribed such a sum that Napoleon&rsquo;s attractions
      suddenly sank into insignificance and the railroad concluded to follow a
      comparatively straight coarse instead of going miles out of its way to
      build up a metropolis in the muddy desert of Stone&rsquo;s Landing.

      The thunderbolt fell. After all the Colonel&rsquo;s deep planning; after all his
      brain work and tongue work in drawing public attention to his pet project
      and enlisting interest in it; after all his faithful hard toil with his
      hands, and running hither and thither on his busy feet; after all his high
      hopes and splendid prophecies, the fates had turned their backs on him at
      last, and all in a moment his air-castles crumbled to ruins about him.
      Hawkeye rose from her fright triumphant and rejoicing, and down went
      Stone&rsquo;s Landing! One by one its meagre parcel of inhabitants packed up and
      moved away, as the summer waned and fall approached. Town lots were no
      longer salable, traffic ceased, a deadly lethargy fell upon the place once
      more, the &ldquo;Weekly Telegraph&rdquo; faded into an early grave, the wary tadpole
      returned from exile, the bullfrog resumed his ancient song, the tranquil
      turtle sunned his back upon bank and log and drowsed his grateful life
      away as in the old sweet days of yore.

    </p>
    <p>
      Philip Sterling was on his way to Ilium, in the state of Pennsylvania.
      Ilium was the railway station nearest to the tract of wild land which Mr.
      Bolton had commissioned him to examine.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last day of the journey as the railway train Philip was on was
      leaving a large city, a lady timidly entered the drawing-room car, and
      hesitatingly took a chair that was at the moment unoccupied. Philip saw
      from the window that a gentleman had put her upon the car just as it was
      starting. In a few moments the conductor entered, and without waiting an
      explanation, said roughly to the lady,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you can&rsquo;t sit there. That seat&rsquo;s taken. Go into the other car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not intend to take the seat,&rdquo; said the lady rising, &ldquo;I only sat
      down a moment till the conductor should come and give me a seat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There aint any. Car&rsquo;s full. You&rsquo;ll have to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; said the lady, appealingly, &ldquo;I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help what you thought&mdash;you must go into the other car.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The train is going very fast, let me stand here till we stop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lady can have my seat,&rdquo; cried Philip, springing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor turned towards Philip, and coolly and deliberately surveyed
      him from head to foot, with contempt in every line of his face, turned his
      back upon him without a word, and said to the lady,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, I&rsquo;ve got no time to talk. You must go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p265" id="p265"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p265.jpg (50K)" src="images/p265.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, entirely disconcerted by such rudeness, and frightened, moved
      towards the door, opened it and stepped out. The train was swinging along
      at a rapid rate, jarring from side to side; the step was a long one
      between the cars and there was no protecting grating. The lady attempted
      it, but lost her balance, in the wind and the motion of the car, and fell!
      She would inevitably have gone down under the wheels, if Philip, who had
      swiftly followed her, had not caught her arm and drawn her up. He then
      assisted her across, found her a seat, received her bewildered thanks, and
      returned to his car.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor was still there, taking his tickets, and growling something
      about imposition. Philip marched up to him, and burst out with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a brute, an infernal brute, to treat a woman that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to make a fuss about it,&rdquo; sneered the conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip&rsquo;s reply was a blow, given so suddenly and planted so squarely in
      the conductor&rsquo;s face, that it sent him reeling over a fat passenger, who
      was looking up in mild wonder that any one should dare to dispute with a
      conductor, and against the side of the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recovered himself, reached the bell rope, &ldquo;Damn you, I&rsquo;ll learn you,&rdquo;
       stepped to the door and called a couple of brakemen, and then, as the
      speed slackened; roared out,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get off this train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not get off. I have as much right here as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said the conductor, advancing with the brakemen. The
      passengers protested, and some of them said to each other, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s too
      bad,&rdquo; as they always do in such cases, but none of them offered to take a
      hand with Philip. The men seized him, wrenched him from his seat, dragged
      him along the aisle, tearing his clothes, thrust him from the car, and,
      then flung his carpet-bag, overcoat and umbrella after him. And the train
      went on.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor, red in the face and puffing from his exertion, swaggered
      through the car, muttering &ldquo;Puppy, I&rsquo;ll learn him.&rdquo; The passengers, when
      he had gone, were loud in their indignation, and talked about signing a
      protest, but they did nothing more than talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the Hooverville Patriot and Clarion had this &ldquo;item&rdquo;:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SLIGHTUALLY OVERBOARD.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We learn that as the down noon express was leaving H&mdash;&mdash;
        yesterday a lady! (God save the mark) attempted to force herself into
        the already full palatial car. Conductor Slum, who is too old a bird to
        be caught with chaff, courteously informed her that the car was full,
        and when she insisted on remaining, he persuaded her to go into the car
        where she belonged. Thereupon a young sprig, from the East, blustered
        like a Shanghai rooster, and began to sass the conductor with his chin
        music. That gentleman delivered the young aspirant for a muss one of his
        elegant little left-handers, which so astonished him that he began to
        feel for his shooter. Whereupon Mr. Slum gently raised the youth,
        carried him forth, and set him down just outside the car to cool off.
        Whether the young blood has yet made his way out of Bascom&rsquo;s swamp, we
        have not learned. Conductor Slum is one of the most gentlemanly and
        efficient officers on the road; but he ain&rsquo;t trifled with, not much. We
        learn that the company have put a new engine on the seven o&rsquo;clock train,
        and newly upholstered the drawing-room car throughout. It spares no
        effort for the comfort of the traveling public.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Philip never had been before in Bascom&rsquo;s swamp, and there was nothing
      inviting in it to detain him. After the train got out of the way he
      crawled out of the briars and the mud, and got upon the track. He was
      somewhat bruised, but he was too angry to mind that. He plodded along over
      the ties in a very hot condition of mind and body. In the scuffle, his
      railway check had disappeared, and he grimly wondered, as he noticed the
      loss, if the company would permit him to walk over their track if they
      should know he hadn&rsquo;t a ticket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had to walk some five miles before he reached a little station,
      where he could wait for a train, and he had ample time for reflection. At
      first he was full of vengeance on the company. He would sue it. He would
      make it pay roundly. But then it occurred to him that he did not know the
      name of a witness he could summon, and that a personal fight against a
      railway corporation was about the most hopeless in the world. He then
      thought he would seek out that conductor, lie in wait for him at some
      station, and thrash him, or get thrashed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he got cooler, that did not seem to him a project worthy of a
      gentleman exactly. Was it possible for a gentleman to get even with such a
      fellow as that conductor on the letter&rsquo;s own plane? And when he came to
      this point, he began to ask himself, if he had not acted very much like a
      fool. He didn&rsquo;t regret striking the fellow&mdash;he hoped he had left a
      mark on him. But, after all, was that the best way? Here was he, Philip
      Sterling, calling himself a gentleman, in a brawl with a vulgar conductor,
      about a woman he had never seen before. Why should he have put himself in
      such a ridiculous position? Wasn&rsquo;t it enough to have offered the lady his
      seat, to have rescued her from an accident, perhaps from death? Suppose he
      had simply said to the conductor, &ldquo;Sir, your conduct is brutal, I shall
      report you.&rdquo; The passengers, who saw the affair, might have joined in a
      report against the conductor, and he might really have accomplished
      something. And, now! Philip looked at his torn clothes, and thought with
      disgust of his haste in getting into a fight with such an autocrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the little station where Philip waited for the next train, he met a man&mdash;who
      turned out to be a justice of the peace in that neighborhood, and told him
      his adventure. He was a kindly sort of man, and seemed very much
      interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dum &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said he, when he had heard the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think any thing can be done, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I guess tain&rsquo;t no use. I hain&rsquo;t a mite of doubt of every word you
      say. But suin&rsquo;s no use. The railroad company owns all these people along
      here, and the judges on the bench too. Spiled your clothes! Wal, &lsquo;least
      said&rsquo;s soonest mended.&rsquo; You haint no chance with the company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p268" id="p268"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p268.jpg (11K)" src="images/p268.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When next morning, he read the humorous account in the Patriot and
      Clarion, he saw still more clearly what chance he would have had before
      the public in a fight with the railroad company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Philip&rsquo;s conscience told him that it was his plain duty to carry the
      matter into the courts, even with the certainty of defeat. He confessed
      that neither he nor any citizen had a right to consult his own feelings or
      conscience in a case where a law of the land had been violated before his
      own eyes. He confessed that every citizen&rsquo;s first duty in such case is to
      put aside his own business and devote his time and his best efforts to
      seeing that the infraction is promptly punished; and he knew that no
      country can be well governed unless its citizens as a body keep
      religiously before their minds that they are the guardians of the law, and
      that the law officers are only the machinery for its execution, nothing
      more. As a finality he was obliged to confess that he was a bad citizen,
      and also that the general laxity of the time, and the absence of a sense
      of duty toward any part of the community but the individual himself were
      ingrained in him, and he was no better than the rest of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this little adventure was that Philip did not reach Ilium
      till daylight the next morning, when he descended sleepy and sore, from a
      way train, and looked about him. Ilium was in a narrow mountain gorge,
      through which a rapid stream ran. It consisted of the plank platform on
      which he stood, a wooden house, half painted, with a dirty piazza
      (unroofed) in front, and a sign board hung on a slanting pole&mdash;bearing
      the legend, &ldquo;Hotel. P. Dusenheimer,&rdquo; a sawmill further down the stream, a
      blacksmith-shop, and a store, and three or four unpainted dwellings of the
      slab variety.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p269" id="p269"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p269.jpg (21K)" src="images/p269.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      As Philip approached the hotel he saw what appeared to be a wild beast
      crouching on the piazza. It did not stir, however, and he soon found that
      it was only a stuffed skin. This cheerful invitation to the tavern was the
      remains of a huge panther which had been killed in the region a few weeks
      before. Philip examined his ugly visage and strong crooked fore-arm, as he
      was waiting admittance, having pounded upon the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yait a bit. I&rsquo;ll shoost&mdash;put on my trowsers,&rdquo; shouted a voice from
      the window, and the door was soon opened by the yawning landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morgen! Didn&rsquo;t hear d&rsquo; drain oncet. Dem boys geeps me up zo spate. Gom
      right in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was shown into a dirty bar-room. It was a small room, with a stove
      in the middle, set in a long shallow box of sand, for the benefit of the
      &ldquo;spitters,&rdquo; a bar across one end&mdash;a mere counter with a sliding
      glass-case behind it containing a few bottles having ambitious labels, and
      a wash-sink in one corner. On the walls were the bright yellow and black
      handbills of a traveling circus, with pictures of acrobats in human
      pyramids, horses flying in long leaps through the air, and sylph-like
      women in a paradisaic costume, balancing themselves upon the tips of their
      toes on the bare backs of frantic and plunging steeds, and kissing their
      hands to the spectators meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Philip did not desire a room at that hour, he was invited to wash
      himself at the nasty sink, a feat somewhat easier than drying his face,
      for the towel that hung in a roller over the sink was evidently as much a
      fixture as the sink itself, and belonged, like the suspended brush and
      comb, to the traveling public. Philip managed to complete his toilet by
      the use of his pocket-handkerchief, and declining the hospitality of the
      landlord, implied in the remark, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;d dake notin&rsquo;?&rdquo; he went into the
      open air to wait for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country he saw was wild but not picturesque. The mountain before him
      might be eight hundred feet high, and was only a portion of a long
      unbroken range, savagely wooded, which followed the stream. Behind the
      hotel, and across the brawling brook, was another level-topped, wooded
      range exactly like it. Ilium itself, seen at a glance, was old enough to
      be dilapidated, and if it had gained anything by being made a wood and
      water station of the new railroad, it was only a new sort of grime and
      rawness. P. Dusenheimer, standing in the door of his uninviting groggery,
      when the trains stopped for water; never received from the traveling
      public any patronage except facetious remarks upon his personal
      appearance. Perhaps a thousand times he had heard the remark, &ldquo;Ilium
      fuit,&rdquo; followed in most instances by a hail to himself as &ldquo;AEneas,&rdquo; with
      the inquiry &ldquo;Where is old Anchises?&rdquo; At first he had replied, &ldquo;Dere ain&rsquo;t
      no such man;&rdquo; but irritated by its senseless repetition, he had latterly
      dropped into the formula of, &ldquo;You be dam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip was recalled from the contemplation of Ilium by the rolling and
      growling of the gong within the hotel, the din and clamor increasing till
      the house was apparently unable to contain it; when it burst out of the
      front door and informed the world that breakfast was on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dining room was long, low and narrow, and a narrow table extended its
      whole length. Upon this was spread a cloth which from appearance might
      have been as long in use as the towel in the barroom. Upon the table was
      the usual service, the heavy, much nicked stone ware, the row of plated
      and rusty castors, the sugar bowls with the zinc tea-spoons sticking up in
      them, the piles of yellow biscuits, the discouraged-looking plates of
      butter. The landlord waited, and Philip was pleased to observe the change
      in his manner. In the barroom he was the conciliatory landlord. Standing
      behind his guests at table, he had an air of peremptory patronage, and the
      voice in which he shot out the inquiry, as he seized Philip&rsquo;s plate,
      &ldquo;Beefsteak or liver?&rdquo; quite took away Philip&rsquo;s power of choice. He begged
      for a glass of milk, after trying that green hued compound called coffee,
      and made his breakfast out of that and some hard crackers which seemed to
      have been imported into Ilium before the introduction of the iron horse,
      and to have withstood a ten years siege of regular boarders, Greeks and
      others.

      The land that Philip had come to look at was at least five miles distant
      from Ilium station. A corner of it touched the railroad, but the rest was
      pretty much an unbroken wilderness, eight or ten thousand acres of rough
      country, most of it such a mountain range as he saw at Ilium.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first step was to hire three woodsmen to accompany him. By their help
      he built a log hut, and established a camp on the land, and then began his
      explorations, mapping down his survey as he went along, noting the timber,
      and the lay of the land, and making superficial observations as to the
      prospect of coal.

    <p>
      The landlord at Ilium endeavored to persuade Philip to hire the services
      of a witch-hazel professor of that region, who could walk over the land
      with his wand and tell him infallibly whether it contained coal, and
      exactly where the strata ran. But Philip preferred to trust to his own
      study of the country, and his knowledge of the geological formation. He
      spent a month in traveling over the land and making calculations; and made
      up his mind that a fine vein of coal ran through the mountain about a mile
      from the railroad, and that the place to run in a tunnel was half way
      towards its summit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting with his usual promptness, Philip, with the consent of Mr. Bolton,
      broke ground there at once, and, before snow came, had some rude buildings
      up, and was ready for active operations in the spring. It was true that
      there were no outcroppings of coal at the place, and the people at Ilium
      said he &ldquo;mought as well dig for plug terbaccer there;&rdquo; but Philip had
      great faith in the uniformity of nature&rsquo;s operations in ages past, and he
      had no doubt that he should strike at this spot the rich vein that had
      made the fortune of the Golden Briar Company.

      Once more Louise had good news from her Washington&mdash;Senator Dilworthy
      was going to sell the Tennessee Land to the government! Louise told Laura
      in confidence. She had told her parents, too, and also several bosom
      friends; but all of these people had simply looked sad when they heard the
      news, except Laura. Laura&rsquo;s face suddenly brightened under it&mdash;only
      for an instant, it is true, but poor Louise was grateful for even that
      fleeting ray of encouragement. When next Laura was alone, she fell into a
      train of thought something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Senator has really taken hold of this matter, I may look for that
      invitation to his house at any moment. I am perishing to go! I do long to
      know whether I am only simply a large-sized pigmy among these pigmies
      here, who tumble over so easily when one strikes them, or whether I am
      really&mdash;.&rdquo; Her thoughts drifted into other channels, for a season.
      Then she continued:&mdash;&ldquo;He said I could be useful in the great cause of
      philanthropy, and help in the blessed work of uplifting the poor and the
      ignorant, if he found it feasible to take hold of our Land. Well, that is
      neither here nor there; what I want, is to go to Washington and find out
      what I am. I want money, too; and if one may judge by what she hears,
      there are chances there for a&mdash;.&rdquo; For a fascinating woman, she was
      going to say, perhaps, but she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along in the fall the invitation came, sure enough. It came officially
      through brother Washington, the private Secretary, who appended a
      postscript that was brimming with delight over the prospect of seeing the
      Duchess again. He said it would be happiness enough to look upon her face
      once more&mdash;it would be almost too much happiness when to it was added
      the fact that she would bring messages with her that were fresh from
      Louise&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Washington&rsquo;s letter were several important enclosures. For instance,
      there was the Senator&rsquo;s check for $2,000&mdash;&ldquo;to buy suitable clothing
      in New York with!&rdquo; It was a loan to be refunded when the Land was sold.
      Two thousand&mdash;this was fine indeed. Louise&rsquo;s father was called rich,
      but Laura doubted if Louise had ever had $400 worth of new clothing at one
      time in her life. With the check came two through tickets&mdash;good on
      the railroad from Hawkeye to Washington via New York&mdash;and they were
      &ldquo;dead-head&rdquo; tickets, too, which had been given to Senator Dilworthy by the
      railway companies. Senators and representatives were paid thousands of
      dollars by the government for traveling expenses, but they always traveled
      &ldquo;deadhead&rdquo; both ways, and then did as any honorable, high-minded men would
      naturally do&mdash;declined to receive the mileage tendered them by the
      government. The Senator had plenty of railway passes, and could easily
      spare two to Laura&mdash;one for herself and one for a male escort.
      Washington suggested that she get some old friend of the family to come
      with her, and said the Senator would &ldquo;deadhead&rdquo; him home again as soon as
      he had grown tired of the sights of the capital. Laura thought the thing
      over. At first she was pleased with the idea, but presently she began to
      feel differently about it. Finally she said, &ldquo;No, our staid, steady-going
      Hawkeye friends&rsquo; notions and mine differ about some things&mdash;they
      respect me, now, and I respect them&mdash;better leave it so&mdash;I will
      go alone; I am not afraid to travel by myself.&rdquo; And so communing with
      herself, she left the house for an afternoon walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost at the door she met Col. Sellers. She told him about her invitation
      to Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me!&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;I have about made up my mind to go there
      myself. You see we&rsquo;ve got to get another appropriation through, and the
      Company want me to come east and put it through Congress. Harry&rsquo;s there,
      and he&rsquo;ll do what he can, of course; and Harry&rsquo;s a good fellow and always
      does the very best he knows how, but then he&rsquo;s young&mdash;rather young
      for some parts of such work, you know&mdash;and besides he talks too much,
      talks a good deal too much; and sometimes he appears to be a little bit
      visionary, too, I think the worst thing in the world for a business man. A
      man like that always exposes his cards, sooner or later. This sort of
      thing wants an old, quiet, steady hand&mdash;wants an old cool head, you
      know, that knows men, through and through, and is used to large
      operations. I&rsquo;m expecting my salary, and also some dividends from the
      company, and if they get along in time, I&rsquo;ll go along with you Laura&mdash;take
      you under my wing&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t travel alone. Lord I wish I had the
      money right now. &mdash;But there&rsquo;ll be plenty soon&mdash;plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura reasoned with herself that if the kindly, simple-hearted Colonel was
      going anyhow, what could she gain by traveling alone and throwing away his
      company? So she told him she accepted his offer gladly, gratefully. She
      said it would be the greatest of favors if he would go with her and
      protect her&mdash;not at his own expense as far as railway fares were
      concerned, of course; she could not expect him to put himself to so much
      trouble for her and pay his fare besides. But he wouldn&rsquo;t hear of her
      paying his fare&mdash;it would be only a pleasure to him to serve her.
      Laura insisted on furnishing the tickets; and finally, when argument
      failed, she said the tickets cost neither her nor any one else a cent&mdash;she
      had two of them&mdash;she needed but one&mdash;and if he would not take
      the other she would not go with him. That settled the matter. He took the
      ticket. Laura was glad that she had the check for new clothing, for she
      felt very certain of being able to get the Colonel to borrow a little of
      the money to pay hotel bills with, here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote Washington to look for her and Col. Sellers toward the end of
      November; and at about the time set the two travelers arrived safe in the
      capital of the nation, sure enough.

      Mr. Henry Brierly was exceedingly busy in New York, so he wrote Col.
      Sellers, but he would drop everything and go to Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel believed that Harry was the prince of lobbyists, a little too
      sanguine, may be, and given to speculation, but, then, he knew everybody;
      the Columbus River navigation scheme was got through almost entirely by
      his aid. He was needed now to help through another scheme, a benevolent
      scheme in which Col. Sellers, through the Hawkinses, had a deep interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, you know,&rdquo; he wrote to Harry, &ldquo;so much about the niggroes.
      But if the government will buy this land, it will set up the Hawkins
      family&mdash;make Laura an heiress&mdash;and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if Beriah
      Sellers would set up his carriage again. Dilworthy looks at it different,
      of course. He&rsquo;s all for philanthropy, for benefiting the colored race.
      There&rsquo;s old Balsam, was in the Interior&mdash;used to be the Rev. Orson
      Balsam of Iowa&mdash;he&rsquo;s made the riffle on the Injun; great Injun
      pacificator and land dealer. Balaam&rsquo;a got the Injun to himself, and I
      suppose that Senator Dilworthy feels that there is nothing left him but
      the colored man. I do reckon he is the best friend the colored man has got
      in Washington.&rdquo;

      Though Harry was in a hurry to reach Washington, he stopped in
      Philadelphia; and prolonged his visit day after day, greatly to the
      detriment of his business both in New York and Washington. The society at
      the Bolton&rsquo;s might have been a valid excuse for neglecting business much
      more important than his. Philip was there; he was a partner with Mr.
      Bolton now in the new coal venture, concerning which there was much to be
      arranged in preparation for the Spring work, and Philip lingered week
      after week in the hospitable house. Alice was making a winter visit. Ruth
      only went to town twice a week to attend lectures, and the household was
      quite to Mr. Bolton&rsquo;s taste, for he liked the cheer of company and
      something going on evenings. Harry was cordially asked to bring his
      traveling-bag there, and he did not need urging to do so. Not even the
      thought of seeing Laura at the capital made him restless in the society of
      the two young ladies; two birds in hand are worth one in the bush
      certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was at home&mdash;he sometimes wished he were not so much so. He
      felt that too much or not enough was taken for granted. Ruth had met him,
      when he first came, with a cordial frankness, and her manner continued
      entirely unrestrained. She neither sought his company nor avoided it, and
      this perfectly level treatment irritated him more than any other could
      have done. It was impossible to advance much in love-making with one who
      offered no obstacles, had no concealments and no embarrassments, and whom
      any approach to sentimentality would be quite likely to set into a fit of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Phil,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;what puts you in the dumps to day? You are as
      solemn as the upper bench in Meeting. I shall have to call Alice to raise
      your spirits; my presence seems to depress you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your presence, but your absence when you are present,&rdquo; began
      Philip, dolefully, with the idea that he was saying a rather deep thing.
      &ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t understand me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I confess I cannot. If you really are so low, as to think I am absent
      when I am present, it&rsquo;s a frightful case of aberration; I shall ask father
      to bring out Dr. Jackson. Does Alice appear to be present when she is
      absent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alice has some human feeling, anyway. She cares for something besides
      musty books and dry bones. I think, Ruth, when I die,&rdquo; said Philip,
      intending to be very grim and sarcastic, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you my skeleton. You
      might like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be more cheerful than you are at times,&rdquo; Ruth replied with a
      laugh. &ldquo;But you mustn&rsquo;t do it without consulting Alice. She might not like
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you should bring Alice up on every occasion. Do you
      think I am in love with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, no. It never entered my head. Are you? The thought of Philip
      Sterling in love is too comical. I thought you were only in love with the
      Ilium coal mine, which you and father talk about half the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This is a specimen of Philip&rsquo;s wooing. Confound the girl, he would say to
      himself, why does she never tease Harry and that young Shepley who comes
      here?
    </p>
    <p>
      How differently Alice treated him. She at least never mocked him, and it
      was a relief to talk with one who had some sympathy with him. And he did
      talk to her, by the hour, about Ruth. The blundering fellow poured all his
      doubts and anxieties into her ear, as if she had been the impassive
      occupant of one of those little wooden confessionals in the Cathedral on
      Logan Square. Has a confessor, if she is young and pretty, any feeling?
      Does it mend the matter by calling her your sister?
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip called Alice his good sister, and talked to her about love and
      marriage, meaning Ruth, as if sisters could by no possibility have any
      personal concern in such things. Did Ruth ever speak of him? Did she think
      Ruth cared for him? Did Ruth care for anybody at Fallkill? Did she care
      for anything except her profession? And so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice was loyal to Ruth, and if she knew anything she did not betray her
      friend. She did not, at any rate, give Philip too much encouragement. What
      woman, under the circumstances, would?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you one thing, Philip,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if ever Ruth Bolton loves,
      it will be with her whole soul, in a depth of passion that will sweep
      everything before it and surprise even herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A remark that did not much console Philip, who imagined that only some
      grand heroism could unlock the sweetness of such a heart; and Philip
      feared that he wasn&rsquo;t a hero. He did not know out of what materials a
      woman can construct a hero, when she is in the creative mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry skipped into this society with his usual lightness and gaiety. His
      good nature was inexhaustible, and though he liked to relate his own
      exploits, he had a little tact in adapting himself to the tastes of his
      hearers. He was not long in finding out that Alice liked to hear about
      Philip, and Harry launched out into the career of his friend in the West,
      with a prodigality of invention that would have astonished the chief
      actor. He was the most generous fellow in the world, and picturesque
      conversation was the one thing in which he never was bankrupt. With Mr.
      Bolton he was the serious man of business, enjoying the confidence of many
      of the monied men in New York, whom Mr. Bolton knew, and engaged with them
      in railway schemes and government contracts. Philip, who had so long known
      Harry, never could make up his mind that Harry did not himself believe
      that he was a chief actor in all these large operations of which he talked
      so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry did not neglect to endeavor to make himself agreeable to Mrs.
      Bolton, by paying great attention to the children, and by professing the
      warmest interest in the Friends&rsquo; faith. It always seemed to him the most
      peaceful religion; he thought it must be much easier to live by an
      internal light than by a lot of outward rules; he had a dear Quaker aunt
      in Providence of whom Mrs. Bolton constantly reminded him. He insisted
      upon going with Mrs. Bolton and the children to the Friends Meeting on
      First Day, when Ruth and Alice and Philip, &ldquo;world&rsquo;s people,&rdquo; went to a
      church in town, and he sat through the hour of silence with his hat on, in
      most exemplary patience. In short, this amazing actor succeeded so well
      with Mrs. Bolton, that she said to Philip one day,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy friend, Henry Brierly, appears to be a very worldly minded young man.
      Does he believe in anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Philip laughing, &ldquo;he believes in more things than any
      other person I ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Ruth, Harry seemed to be very congenial. He was never moody for one
      thing, but lent himself with alacrity to whatever her fancy was. He was
      gay or grave as the need might be. No one apparently could enter more
      fully into her plans for an independent career.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;was bred a physician, and practiced a little
      before he went into Wall street. I always had a leaning to the study.
      There was a skeleton hanging in the closet of my father&rsquo;s study when I was
      a boy, that I used to dress up in old clothes. Oh, I got quite familiar
      with the human frame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have,&rdquo; said Philip. &ldquo;Was that where you learned to play the
      bones? He is a master of those musical instruments, Ruth; he plays well
      enough to go on the stage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip hates science of any kind, and steady application,&rdquo; retorted
      Harry. He didn&rsquo;t fancy Philip&rsquo;s banter, and when the latter had gone out,
      and Ruth asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take up medicine, Mr. Brierly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry said, &ldquo;I have it in mind. I believe I would begin attending lectures
      this winter if it weren&rsquo;t for being wanted in Washington. But medicine is
      particularly women&rsquo;s province.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked Ruth, rather amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the treatment of disease is a good deal a matter of sympathy. A
      woman&rsquo;s intuition is better than a man&rsquo;s. Nobody knows anything, really,
      you know, and a woman can guess a good deal nearer than a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very complimentary to my sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Harry frankly; &ldquo;I should want to choose my doctor; an ugly
      woman would ruin me, the disease would be sure to strike in and kill me at
      sight of her. I think a pretty physician, with engaging manners, would
      coax a fellow to live through almost anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you are a scoffer, Mr. Brierly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I am quite sincere. Wasn&rsquo;t it old what&rsquo;s his name that
      said only the beautiful is useful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether Ruth was anything more than diverted with Harry&rsquo;s company, Philip
      could not determine. He scorned at any rate to advance his own interest by
      any disparaging communications about Harry, both because he could not help
      liking the fellow himself, and because he may have known that he could not
      more surely create a sympathy for him in Ruth&rsquo;s mind. That Ruth was in no
      danger of any serious impression he felt pretty sure, felt certain of it
      when he reflected upon her severe occupation with her profession. Hang it,
      he would say to himself, she is nothing but pure intellect anyway. And he
      only felt uncertain of it when she was in one of her moods of raillery,
      with mocking mischief in her eyes. At such times she seemed to prefer
      Harry&rsquo;s society to his. When Philip was miserable about this, he always
      took refuge with Alice, who was never moody, and who generally laughed him
      out of his sentimental nonsense. He felt at his ease with Alice, and was
      never in want of something to talk about; and he could not account for the
      fact that he was so often dull with Ruth, with whom, of all persons in the
      world, he wanted to appear at his best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was entirely satisfied with his own situation. A bird of passage is
      always at its ease, having no house to build, and no responsibility. He
      talked freely with Philip about Ruth, an almighty fine girl, he said, but
      what the deuce she wanted to study medicine for, he couldn&rsquo;t see.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a concert one night at the Musical Fund Hall and the four had
      arranged to go in and return by the Germantown cars. It was Philip&rsquo;s plan,
      who had engaged the seats, and promised himself an evening with Ruth,
      walking with her, sitting by her in the hall, and enjoying the feeling of
      protecting that a man always has of a woman in a public place. He was fond
      of music, too, in a sympathetic way; at least, he knew that Ruth&rsquo;s delight
      in it would be enough for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he meant to take advantage of the occasion to say some very
      serious things. His love for Ruth was no secret to Mrs. Bolton, and he
      felt almost sure that he should have no opposition in the family. Mrs.
      Bolton had been cautious in what she said, but Philip inferred everything
      from her reply to his own questions, one day, &ldquo;Has thee ever spoken thy
      mind to Ruth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Why shouldn&rsquo;t he speak his mind, and end his doubts? Ruth had been more
      tricksy than usual that day, and in a flow of spirits quite inconsistent,
      it would seem, in a young lady devoted to grave studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Ruth a premonition of Philip&rsquo;s intention, in his manner? It may be,
      for when the girls came down stairs, ready to walk to the cars; and met
      Philip and Harry in the hall, Ruth said, laughing,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The two tallest must walk together&rdquo; and before Philip knew how it
      happened Ruth had taken Harry&rsquo;s arm, and his evening was spoiled. He had
      too much politeness and good sense and kindness to show in his manner that
      he was hit. So he said to Harry,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your disadvantage in being short.&rdquo; And he gave Alice no reason to
      feel during the evening that she would not have been his first choice for
      the excursion. But he was none the less chagrined, and not a little angry
      at the turn the affair took.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hall was crowded with the fashion of the town. The concert was one of
      those fragmentary drearinesses that people endure because they are
      fashionable; tours de force on the piano, and fragments from operas, which
      have no meaning without the setting, with weary pauses of waiting between;
      there is the comic basso who is so amusing and on such familiar terms with
      the audience, and always sings the Barber; the attitudinizing tenor, with
      his languishing &ldquo;Oh, Summer Night;&rdquo; the soprano with her &ldquo;Batti Batti,&rdquo;
       who warbles and trills and runs and fetches her breath, and ends with a
      noble scream that brings down a tempest of applause in the midst of which
      she backs off the stage smiling and bowing. It was this sort of concert,
      and Philip was thinking that it was the most stupid one he ever sat
      through, when just as the soprano was in the midst of that touching
      ballad, &ldquo;Comin&rsquo; thro&rsquo; the Rye&rdquo; (the soprano always sings &ldquo;Comin&rsquo; thro&rsquo; the
      Rye&rdquo; on an encore)&mdash;the Black Swan used to make it irresistible,
      Philip remembered, with her arch, &ldquo;If a body kiss a body&rdquo; there was a cry
      of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hall is long and narrow, and there is only one place of egress.
      Instantly the audience was on its feet, and a rush began for the door. Men
      shouted, women screamed, and panic seized the swaying mass. A second&rsquo;s
      thought would have convinced every one that getting out was impossible,
      and that the only effect of a rush would be to crash people to death. But
      a second&rsquo;s thought was not given. A few cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, sit down,&rdquo; but the mass was turned towards the door. Women were
      down and trampled on in the aisles, and stout men, utterly lost to
      self-control, were mounting the benches, as if to run a race over the mass
      to the entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip who had forced the girls to keep their seats saw, in a flash, the
      new danger, and sprang to avert it. In a second more those infuriated men
      would be over the benches and crushing Ruth and Alice under their boots.
      He leaped upon the bench in front of them and struck out before him with
      all his might, felling one man who was rushing on him, and checking for an
      instant the movement, or rather parting it, and causing it to flow on
      either side of him. But it was only for an instant; the pressure behind
      was too great, and, the next Philip was dashed backwards over the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p286" id="p286"></a>
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet that instant of arrest had probably saved the girls, for as Philip
      fell, the orchestra struck up &ldquo;Yankee Doodle&rdquo; in the liveliest manner. The
      familiar tune caught the ear of the mass, which paused in wonder, and gave
      the conductor&rsquo;s voice a chance to be heard&mdash;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a false alarm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tumult was over in a minute, and the next, laughter was heard, and not
      a few said, &ldquo;I knew it wasn&rsquo;t anything.&rdquo; &ldquo;What fools people are at such a
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The concert was over, however. A good many people were hurt, some of them
      seriously, and among them Philip Sterling was found bent across the seat,
      insensible, with his left arm hanging limp and a bleeding wound on his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was carried into the air he revived, and said it was nothing. A
      surgeon was called, and it was thought best to drive at once to the
      Bolton&rsquo;s, the surgeon supporting Philip, who did not speak the whole way.
      His arm was set and his head dressed, and the surgeon said he would come
      round all right in his mind by morning; he was very weak. Alice who was
      not much frightened while the panic lasted in the hall, was very much
      unnerved by seeing Philip so pale and bloody. Ruth assisted the surgeon
      with the utmost coolness and with skillful hands helped to dress Philip&rsquo;s
      wounds. And there was a certain intentness and fierce energy in what she
      did that might have revealed something to Philip if he had been in his
      senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not, or he would not have murmured &ldquo;Let Alice do it, she is not
      too tall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Ruth&rsquo;s first case.

    </p>
    <p>
      Washington&rsquo;s delight in his beautiful sister was measureless. He said that
      she had always been the queenliest creature in the land, but that she was
      only commonplace before, compared to what she was now, so extraordinary
      was the improvement wrought by rich fashionable attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your criticisms are too full of brotherly partiality to be depended
      on, Washington. Other people will judge differently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed they won&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll see. There will never be a woman in Washington
      that can compare with you. You&rsquo;ll be famous within a fortnight, Laura.
      Everybody will want to know you. You wait&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura wished in her heart that the prophecy might come true; and privately
      she even believed it might&mdash;for she had brought all the women whom
      she had seen since she left home under sharp inspection, and the result
      had not been unsatisfactory to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a week or two Washington drove about the city every day with her
      and familiarized her with all of its salient features. She was beginning
      to feel very much at home with the town itself, and she was also fast
      acquiring ease with the distinguished people she met at the Dilworthy
      table, and losing what little of country timidity she had brought with her
      from Hawkeye. She noticed with secret pleasure the little start of
      admiration that always manifested itself in the faces of the guests when
      she entered the drawing-room arrayed in evening costume: she took
      comforting note of the fact that these guests directed a very liberal
      share of their conversation toward her; she observed with surprise, that
      famous statesmen and soldiers did not talk like gods, as a general thing,
      but said rather commonplace things for the most part; and she was filled
      with gratification to discover that she, on the contrary, was making a
      good many shrewd speeches and now and then a really brilliant one, and
      furthermore, that they were beginning to be repeated in social circles
      about the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Congress began its sittings, and every day or two Washington escorted her
      to the galleries set apart for lady members of the households of Senators
      and Representatives. Here was a larger field and a wider competition, but
      still she saw that many eyes were uplifted toward her face, and that first
      one person and then another called a neighbor&rsquo;s attention to her; she was
      not too dull to perceive that the speeches of some of the younger
      statesmen were delivered about as much and perhaps more at her than to the
      presiding officer; and she was not sorry to see that the dapper young
      Senator from Iowa came at once and stood in the open space before the
      president&rsquo;s desk to exhibit his feet as soon as she entered the gallery,
      whereas she had early learned from common report that his usual custom was
      to prop them on his desk and enjoy them himself with a selfish disregard
      of other people&rsquo;s longings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Invitations began to flow in upon her and soon she was fairly &ldquo;in
      society.&rdquo; &ldquo;The season&rdquo; was now in full bloom, and the first select
      reception was at hand&mdash;that is to say, a reception confined to invited
      guests. Senator Dilworthy had become well convinced, by this time, that
      his judgment of the country-bred Missouri girl had not deceived him&mdash;it
      was plain that she was going to be a peerless missionary in the field of
      labor he designed her for, and therefore it would be perfectly safe and
      likewise judicious to send her forth well panoplied for her work.&mdash;So
      he had added new and still richer costumes to her wardrobe, and assisted
      their attractions with costly jewelry&mdash;loans on the future land sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      This first select reception took place at a cabinet minister&rsquo;s&mdash;or
      rather a cabinet secretary&rsquo;s mansion. When Laura and the Senator arrived,
      about half past nine or ten in the evening, the place was already pretty
      well crowded, and the white-gloved negro servant at the door was still
      receiving streams of guests.&mdash;The drawing-rooms were brilliant with
      gaslight, and as hot as ovens. The host and hostess stood just within the
      door of entrance; Laura was presented, and then she passed on into the
      maelstrom of be-jeweled and richly attired low-necked ladies and
      white-kid-gloved and steel pen-coated gentlemen and wherever she moved she
      was followed by a buzz of admiration that was grateful to all her senses&mdash;so
      grateful, indeed, that her white face was tinged and its beauty heightened
      by a perceptible suffusion of color. She caught such remarks as, &ldquo;Who is
      she?&rdquo; &ldquo;Superb woman!&rdquo; &ldquo;That is the new beauty from the west,&rdquo; etc., etc.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever she halted, she was presently surrounded by Ministers, Generals,
      Congressmen, and all manner of aristocratic people. Introductions
      followed, and then the usual original question, &ldquo;How do you like
      Washington, Miss Hawkins?&rdquo; supplemented by that other usual original
      question, &ldquo;Is this your first visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These two exciting topics being exhausted, conversation generally drifted
      into calmer channels, only to be interrupted at frequent intervals by new
      introductions and new inquiries as to how Laura liked the capital and
      whether it was her first visit or not. And thus for an hour or more the
      Duchess moved through the crush in a rapture of happiness, for her doubts
      were dead and gone, now she knew she could conquer here. A familiar face
      appeared in the midst of the multitude and Harry Brierly fought his
      difficult way to her side, his eyes shouting their gratification, so to
      speak:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is a happiness! Tell me, my dear Miss Hawkins&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh! I know what you are going to ask. I do like Washington&mdash;I like
      it ever so much!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I was going to ask&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am coming to it, coming to it as fast as I can. It is my first
      visit. I think you should know that yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And straightway a wave of the crowd swept her beyond his reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what can the girl mean? Of course she likes Washington&mdash;I&rsquo;m not
      such a dummy as to have to ask her that. And as to its being her first
      visit, why bang it, she knows that I knew it was. Does she think I have
      turned idiot? Curious girl, anyway. But how they do swarm about her! She
      is the reigning belle of Washington after this night. She&rsquo;ll know five
      hundred of the heaviest guns in the town before this night&rsquo;s nonsense is
      over. And this isn&rsquo;t even the beginning. Just as I used to say&mdash;she&rsquo;ll
      be a card in the matter of&mdash;yes sir! She shall turn the men&rsquo;s heads
      and I&rsquo;ll turn the women&rsquo;s! What a team that will be in politics here. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t take a quarter of a million for what I can do in this present
      session&mdash;no indeed I wouldn&rsquo;t. Now, here&mdash;I don&rsquo;t altogether
      like this. That insignificant secretary of legation is&mdash;why, she&rsquo;s
      smiling on him as if he&mdash;and now on the Admiral! Now she&rsquo;s
      illuminating that stuffy Congressman from Massachusetts&mdash;vulgar
      ungrammatcal shovel-maker&mdash;greasy knave of spades. I don&rsquo;t like this
      sort of thing. She doesn&rsquo;t appear to be much distressed about me&mdash;she
      hasn&rsquo;t looked this way once. All right, my bird of Paradise, if it suits
      you, go on. But I think I know your sex. I&rsquo;ll go to smiling around a
      little, too, and see what effect that will have on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he did &ldquo;smile around a little,&rdquo; and got as near to her as he could to
      watch the effect, but the scheme was a failure&mdash;he could not get her
      attention. She seemed wholly unconscious of him, and so he could not flirt
      with any spirit; he could only talk disjointedly; he could not keep his
      eyes on the charmers he talked to; he grew irritable, jealous, and very
      unhappy. He gave up his enterprise, leaned his shoulder against a fluted
      pilaster and pouted while he kept watch upon Laura&rsquo;s every movement. His
      other shoulder stole the bloom from many a lovely cheek that brushed him
      in the surging crush, but he noted it not. He was too busy cursing himself
      inwardly for being an egotistical imbecile. An hour ago he had thought to
      take this country lass under his protection and show her &ldquo;life&rdquo; and enjoy
      her wonder and delight&mdash;and here she was, immersed in the marvel up
      to her eyes, and just a trifle more at home in it than he was himself. And
      now his angry comments ran on again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now she&rsquo;s sweetening old Brother Balaam; and he&mdash;well he is inviting
      her to the Congressional prayer-meeting, no doubt&mdash;better let old
      Dilworthy alone to see that she doesn&rsquo;t overlook that. And now its
      Splurge, of New York; and now its Batters of New Hampshire&mdash;and now
      the Vice President! Well I may as well adjourn. I&rsquo;ve got enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he hadn&rsquo;t. He got as far as the door&mdash;and then struggled back to
      take one more look, hating himself all the while for his weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward midnight, when supper was announced, the crowd thronged to the
      supper room where a long table was decked out with what seemed a rare
      repast, but which consisted of things better calculated to feast the eye
      than the appetite. The ladies were soon seated in files along the wall,
      and in groups here and there, and the colored waiters filled the plates
      and glasses and the male guests moved hither and thither conveying them to
      the privileged sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry took an ice and stood up by the table with other gentlemen, and
      listened to the buzz of conversation while he ate.
    </p>
    <p>
      From these remarks he learned a good deal about Laura that was news to
      him. For instance, that she was of a distinguished western family; that
      she was highly educated; that she was very rich and a great landed
      heiress; that she was not a professor of religion, and yet was a Christian
      in the truest and best sense of the word, for her whole heart was devoted
      to the accomplishment of a great and noble enterprise&mdash;none other
      than the sacrificing of her landed estates to the uplifting of the
      down-trodden negro and the turning of his erring feet into the way of
      light and righteousness. Harry observed that as soon as one listener had
      absorbed the story, he turned about and delivered it to his next neighbor
      and the latter individual straightway passed it on. And thus he saw it
      travel the round of the gentlemen and overflow rearward among the ladies.
      He could not trace it backward to its fountain head, and so he could not
      tell who it was that started it.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing annoyed Harry a great deal; and that was the reflection that he
      might have been in Washington days and days ago and thrown his
      fascinations about Laura with permanent effect while she was new and
      strange to the capital, instead of dawdling in Philadelphia to no purpose.
      He feared he had &ldquo;missed a trick,&rdquo; as he expressed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only found one little opportunity of speaking again with Laura before
      the evening&rsquo;s festivities ended, and then, for the first time in years,
      his airy self-complacency failed him, his tongue&rsquo;s easy confidence forsook
      it in a great measure, and he was conscious of an unheroic timidity. He
      was glad to get away and find a place where he could despise himself in
      private and try to grow his clipped plumes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Laura reached home she was tired but exultant, and Senator Dilworthy
      was pleased and satisfied. He called Laura &ldquo;my daughter,&rdquo; next morning,
      and gave her some &ldquo;pin money,&rdquo; as he termed it, and she sent a hundred and
      fifty dollars of it to her mother and loaned a trifle to Col. Sellers.
      Then the Senator had a long private conference with Laura, and unfolded
      certain plans of his for the good of the country, and religion, and the
      poor, and temperance, and showed her how she could assist him in
      developing these worthy and noble enterprises.

    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura soon discovered that there were three distinct aristocracies in
      Washington. One of these, (nick-named the Antiques,) consisted of
      cultivated, high-bred old families who looked back with pride upon an
      ancestry that had been always great in the nation&rsquo;s councils and its wars
      from the birth of the republic downward. Into this select circle it was
      difficult to gain admission. No. 2 was the aristocracy of the middle
      ground&mdash;of which, more anon. No. 3 lay beyond; of it we will say a
      word here. We will call it the Aristocracy of the Parvenus&mdash;as,
      indeed, the general public did. Official position, no matter how obtained,
      entitled a man to a place in it, and carried his family with him, no
      matter whence they sprang. Great wealth gave a man a still higher and
      nobler place in it than did official position. If this wealth had been
      acquired by conspicuous ingenuity, with just a pleasant little spice of
      illegality about it, all the better. This aristocracy was &ldquo;fast,&rdquo; and not
      averse to ostentation.
    </p>

      The aristocracy of the Antiques ignored the aristocracy of the Parvenus;
      the Parvenus laughed at the Antiques, (and secretly envied them.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There were certain important &ldquo;society&rdquo; customs which one in Laura&rsquo;s
      position needed to understand. For instance, when a lady of any prominence
      comes to one of our cities and takes up her residence, all the ladies of
      her grade favor her in turn with an initial call, giving their cards to
      the servant at the door by way of introduction. They come singly,
      sometimes; sometimes in couples; and always in elaborate full dress. They
      talk two minutes and a quarter and then go. If the lady receiving the call
      desires a further acquaintance, she must return the visit within two
      weeks; to neglect it beyond that time means &ldquo;let the matter drop.&rdquo; But if
      she does return the visit within two weeks, it then becomes the other
      party&rsquo;s privilege to continue the acquaintance or drop it. She signifies
      her willingness to continue it by calling again any time within
      twelve-months; after that, if the parties go on calling upon each other
      once a year, in our large cities, that is sufficient, and the
      acquaintanceship holds good. The thing goes along smoothly, now. The
      annual visits are made and returned with peaceful regularity and bland
      satisfaction, although it is not necessary that the two ladies shall
      actually see each other oftener than once every few years. Their cards
      preserve the intimacy and keep the acquaintanceship intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, Mrs. A. pays her annual visit, sits in her carriage and
      sends in her card with the lower right hand corner turned down, which
      signifies that she has &ldquo;called in person;&rdquo; Mrs. B: sends down word that
      she is &ldquo;engaged&rdquo; or &ldquo;wishes to be excused&rdquo;&mdash;or if she is a Parvenu
      and low-bred, she perhaps sends word that she is &ldquo;not at home.&rdquo; Very good;
      Mrs. A. drives on happy and content. If Mrs. A.&lsquo;s daughter marries, or a
      child is born to the family, Mrs. B. calls, sends in her card with the
      upper left hand corner turned down, and then goes along about her affairs&mdash;for
      that inverted corner means &ldquo;Congratulations.&rdquo; If Mrs. B.&lsquo;s husband falls
      downstairs and breaks his neck, Mrs. A. calls, leaves her card with the
      upper right hand corner turned down, and then takes her departure; this
      corner means &ldquo;Condolence.&rdquo; It is very necessary to get the corners right,
      else one may unintentionally condole with a friend on a wedding or
      congratulate her upon a funeral. If either lady is about to leave the
      city, she goes to the other&rsquo;s house and leaves her card with &ldquo;P. P. C.&rdquo;
       engraved under the name&mdash;which signifies, &ldquo;Pay Parting Call.&rdquo; But
      enough of etiquette. Laura was early instructed in the mysteries of
      society life by a competent mentor, and thus was preserved from
      troublesome mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first fashionable call she received from a member of the ancient
      nobility, otherwise the Antiques, was of a pattern with all she received
      from that limb of the aristocracy afterward. This call was paid by Mrs.
      Major-General Fulke-Fulkerson and daughter. They drove up at one in the
      afternoon in a rather antiquated vehicle with a faded coat of arms on the
      panels, an aged white-wooled negro coachman on the box and a younger
      darkey beside him&mdash;the footman. Both of these servants were dressed
      in dull brown livery that had seen considerable service.

      The ladies entered the drawing-room in full character; that is to say,
      with Elizabethan stateliness on the part of the dowager, and an easy grace
      and dignity on the part of the young lady that had a nameless something
      about it that suggested conscious superiority. The dresses of both ladies
      were exceedingly rich, as to material, but as notably modest as to color
      and ornament. All parties having seated themselves, the dowager delivered
      herself of a remark that was not unusual in its form, and yet it came from
      her lips with the impressiveness of Scripture:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The weather has been unpropitious of late, Miss Hawkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has indeed,&rdquo; said Laura. &ldquo;The climate seems to be variable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is its nature of old, here,&rdquo; said the daughter&mdash;stating it
      apparently as a fact, only, and by her manner waving aside all personal
      responsibility on account of it. &ldquo;Is it not so, mamma?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, my child. Do you like winter, Miss Hawkins?&rdquo; She said &ldquo;like&rdquo; as
      if she had an idea that its dictionary meaning was &ldquo;approve of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not as well as summer&mdash;though I think all seasons have their
      charms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very just remark. The general held similar views. He considered
      snow in winter proper; sultriness in summer legitimate; frosts in the
      autumn the same, and rains in spring not objectionable. He was not an
      exacting man. And I call to mind now that he always admired thunder. You
      remember, child, your father always admired thunder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He adored it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt it reminded him of battle,&rdquo; said Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think perhaps it did. He had a great respect for Nature. He often
      said there was something striking about the ocean. You remember his saying
      that, daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, often, Mother. I remember it very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And hurricanes... He took a great interest in hurricanes. And animals.
      Dogs, especially&mdash;hunting dogs. Also comets. I think we all have our
      predilections. I think it is this that gives variety to our tastes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura coincided with this view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you find it hard and lonely to be so far from your home and friends,
      Miss Hawkins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do find it depressing sometimes, but then there is so much about me
      here that is novel and interesting that my days are made up more of
      sunshine than shadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washington is not a dull city in the season,&rdquo; said the young lady. &ldquo;We
      have some very good society indeed, and one need not be at a loss for
      means to pass the time pleasantly. Are you fond of watering-places, Miss
      Hawkins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have really had no experience of them, but I have always felt a strong
      desire to see something of fashionable watering-place life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We of Washington are unfortunately situated in that respect,&rdquo; said the
      dowager. &ldquo;It is a tedious distance to Newport. But there is no help for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura said to herself, &ldquo;Long Branch and Cape May are nearer than Newport;
      doubtless these places are low; I&rsquo;ll feel my way a little and see.&rdquo; Then
      she said aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I thought that Long Branch&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no need to &ldquo;feel&rdquo; any further&mdash;there was that in both faces
      before her which made that truth apparent. The dowager said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody goes there, Miss Hawkins&mdash;at least only persons of no
      position in society. And the President.&rdquo; She added that with tranquility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Newport is damp, and cold, and windy and excessively disagreeable,&rdquo; said
      the daughter, &ldquo;but it is very select. One cannot be fastidious about minor
      matters when one has no choice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visit had spun out nearly three minutes, now. Both ladies rose with
      grave dignity, conferred upon Laura a formal invitation to call, and then
      retired from the conference. Laura remained in the drawing-room and left
      them to pilot themselves out of the house&mdash;an inhospitable thing, it
      seemed to her, but then she was following her instructions. She stood,
      steeped in reverie, a while, and then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could always enjoy icebergs&mdash;as scenery but not as
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still, she knew these two people by reputation, and was aware that they
      were not ice-bergs when they were in their own waters and amid their
      legitimate surroundings, but on the contrary were people to be respected
      for their stainless characters and esteemed for their social virtues and
      their benevolent impulses. She thought it a pity that they had to be such
      changed and dreary creatures on occasions of state.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first call Laura received from the other extremity of the Washington
      aristocracy followed close upon the heels of the one we have just been
      describing. The callers this time were the Hon. Mrs. Oliver Higgins, the
      Hon. Mrs. Patrique Oreille (pronounced O-relay,) Miss Bridget (pronounced
      Breezhay) Oreille, Mrs. Peter Gashly, Miss Gashly, and Miss Emmeline
      Gashly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three carriages arrived at the same moment from different directions.
      They were new and wonderfully shiny, and the brasses on the harness were
      highly polished and bore complicated monograms. There were showy coats of
      arms, too, with Latin mottoes. The coachmen and footmen were clad in
      bright new livery, of striking colors, and they had black rosettes with
      shaving-brushes projecting above them, on the sides of their stove-pipe
      hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the visitors swept into the drawing-room they filled the place with a
      suffocating sweetness procured at the perfumer&rsquo;s. Their costumes, as to
      architecture, were the latest fashion intensified; they were rainbow-hued;
      they were hung with jewels&mdash;chiefly diamonds. It would have been
      plain to any eye that it had cost something to upholster these women.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Mrs. Oliver Higgins was the wife of a delegate from a distant
      territory&mdash;a gentleman who had kept the principal &ldquo;saloon,&rdquo; and sold
      the best whiskey in the principal village in his wilderness, and so, of
      course, was recognized as the first man of his commonwealth and its
      fittest representative.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of paramount influence at home, for he was public spirited,
      he was chief of the fire department, he had an admirable command of
      profane language, and had killed several &ldquo;parties.&rdquo; His shirt fronts were
      always immaculate; his boots daintily polished, and no man could lift a
      foot and fire a dead shot at a stray speck of dirt on it with a white
      handkerchief with a finer grace than he; his watch chain weighed a pound;
      the gold in his finger ring was worth forty five dollars; he wore a
      diamond cluster-pin and he parted his hair behind. He had always been
      regarded as the most elegant gentleman in his territory, and it was
      conceded by all that no man thereabouts was anywhere near his equal in the
      telling of an obscene story except the venerable white-haired governor
      himself. The Hon. Higgins had not come to serve his country in Washington
      for nothing. The appropriation which he had engineered through Congress
      for the maintenance of the Indians in his Territory would have made all
      those savages rich if it had ever got to them.

      The Hon. Mrs. Higgins was a picturesque woman, and a fluent talker, and
      she held a tolerably high station among the Parvenus. Her English was fair
      enough, as a general thing&mdash;though, being of New York origin, she had
      the fashion peculiar to many natives of that city of pronouncing saw and
      law as if they were spelt sawr and lawr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petroleum was the agent that had suddenly transformed the Gashlys from
      modest hard-working country village folk into &ldquo;loud&rdquo; aristocrats and
      ornaments of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Patrique Oreille was a wealthy Frenchman from Cork. Not that he
      was wealthy when he first came from Cork, but just the reverse. When he
      first landed in New York with his wife, he had only halted at Castle
      Garden for a few minutes to receive and exhibit papers showing that he had
      resided in this country two years&mdash;and then he voted the democratic
      ticket and went up town to hunt a house. He found one and then went to
      work as assistant to an architect and builder, carrying a hod all day and
      studying politics evenings. Industry and economy soon enabled him to start
      a low rum shop in a foul locality, and this gave him political influence.
      In our country it is always our first care to see that our people have the
      opportunity of voting for their choice of men to represent and govern them&mdash;we
      do not permit our great officials to appoint the little officials. We
      prefer to have so tremendous a power as that in our own hands. We hold it
      safest to elect our judges and everybody else. In our cities, the ward
      meetings elect delegates to the nominating conventions and instruct them
      whom to nominate. The publicans and their retainers rule the ward meetings
      (for everybody else hates the worry of politics and stays at home); the
      delegates from the ward meetings organize as a nominating convention and
      make up a list of candidates&mdash;one convention offering a democratic
      and another a republican list of incorruptibles; and then the great meek
      public come forward at the proper time and make unhampered choice and
      bless Heaven that they live in a free land where no form of despotism can
      ever intrude.

      Patrick O&rsquo;Riley (as his name then stood) created friends and influence
      very fast, for he was always on hand at the police courts to give straw
      bail for his customers or establish an alibi for them in case they had
      been beating anybody to death on his premises. Consequently he presently
      became a political leader, and was elected to a petty office under the
      city government. Out of a meager salary he soon saved money enough to open
      quite a stylish liquor saloon higher up town, with a faro bank attached
      and plenty of capital to conduct it with. This gave him fame and great
      respectability. The position of alderman was forced upon him, and it was
      just the same as presenting him a gold mine. He had fine horses and
      carriages, now, and closed up his whiskey mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by he became a large contractor for city work, and was a bosom
      friend of the great and good Wm. M. Weed himself, who had stolen
      $20,600,000 from the city and was a man so envied, so honored,&mdash;so
      adored, indeed, that when the sheriff went to his office to arrest him as
      a felon, that sheriff blushed and apologized, and one of the illustrated
      papers made a picture of the scene and spoke of the matter in such a way
      as to show that the editor regretted that the offense of an arrest had
      been offered to so exalted a personage as Mr. Weed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. O&rsquo;Riley furnished shingle nails to the new Court House at three
      thousand dollars a keg, and eighteen gross of 60-cent thermometers at
      fifteen hundred dollars a dozen; the controller and the board of audit
      passed the bills, and a mayor, who was simply ignorant but not criminal,
      signed them. When they were paid, Mr. O&rsquo;Riley&rsquo;s admirers gave him a
      solitaire diamond pin of the size of a filbert, in imitation of the
      liberality of Mr. Weed&rsquo;s friends, and then Mr. O&rsquo;Riley retired from active
      service and amused himself with buying real estate at enormous figures and
      holding it in other people&rsquo;s names. By and by the newspapers came out with
      exposures and called Weed and O&rsquo;Riley &ldquo;thieves,&rdquo;&mdash;whereupon the
      people rose as one man (voting repeatedly) and elected the two gentlemen
      to their proper theatre of action, the New York legislature. The
      newspapers clamored, and the courts proceeded to try the new legislators
      for their small irregularities. Our admirable jury system enabled the
      persecuted ex-officials to secure a jury of nine gentlemen from a
      neighboring asylum and three graduates from Sing-Sing, and presently they
      walked forth with characters vindicated. The legislature was called upon
      to spew them forth&mdash;a thing which the legislature declined to do. It
      was like asking children to repudiate their own father. It was a
      legislature of the modern pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being now wealthy and distinguished, Mr. O&rsquo;Riley, still bearing the
      legislative &ldquo;Hon.&rdquo; attached to his name (for titles never die in America,
      although we do take a republican pride in poking fun at such trifles),
      sailed for Europe with his family. They traveled all about, turning their
      noses up at every thing, and not finding it a difficult thing to do,
      either, because nature had originally given those features a cast in that
      direction; and finally they established themselves in Paris, that Paradise
      of Americans of their sort.&mdash;They staid there two years and learned
      to speak English with a foreign accent&mdash;not that it hadn&rsquo;t always had
      a foreign accent (which was indeed the case) but now the nature of it was
      changed. Finally they returned home and became ultra fashionables. They
      landed here as the Hon. Patrique Oreille and family, and so are known unto
      this day.

      Laura provided seats for her visitors and they immediately launched forth
      into a breezy, sparkling conversation with that easy confidence which is
      to be found only among persons accustomed to high life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been intending to call sooner, Miss Hawkins,&rdquo; said the Hon. Mrs.
      Oreille, &ldquo;but the weather&rsquo;s been so horrid. How do you like Washington?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura liked it very well indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gashly&mdash;&ldquo;Is it your first visit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was her first.
    </p>
    <p>
      All&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Oreille&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll despise the weather, Miss Hawkins.
      It&rsquo;s perfectly awful. It always is. I tell Mr. Oreille I can&rsquo;t and I won&rsquo;t
      put up with any such a climate. If we were obliged to do it, I wouldn&rsquo;t
      mind it; but we are not obliged to, and so I don&rsquo;t see the use of it.
      Sometimes its real pitiful the way the childern pine for Parry&mdash;don&rsquo;t
      look so sad, Bridget, &lsquo;ma chere&rsquo;&mdash;poor child, she can&rsquo;t hear Parry
      mentioned without getting the blues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gashly&mdash;&ldquo;Well I should think so, Mrs. Oreille. A body lives in
      Paris, but a body, only stays here. I dote on Paris; I&rsquo;d druther scrimp
      along on ten thousand dollars a year there, than suffer and worry here on
      a real decent income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Gashly&mdash;&ldquo;Well then, I wish you&rsquo;d take us back, mother; I&rsquo;m sure
      I hate this stoopid country enough, even if it is our dear native land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Emmeline Gashly&mdash;&ldquo;What and leave poor Johnny Peterson behind?&rdquo;
       [An airy genial laugh applauded this sally].
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Gashly&mdash;&ldquo;Sister, I should think you&rsquo;d be ashamed of yourself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Emmeline&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t ruffle your feathers so: I was only
      joking. He don&rsquo;t mean anything by coming to the house every evening&mdash;only
      comes to see mother. Of course that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; [General laughter].
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss G. prettily confused&mdash;&ldquo;Emmeline, how can you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. G.&mdash;&ldquo;Let your sister alone, Emmeline. I never saw such a tease!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Oreille&mdash;&ldquo;What lovely corals you have, Miss Hawkins! Just look
      at them, Bridget, dear. I&rsquo;ve a great passion for corals&mdash;it&rsquo;s a pity
      they&rsquo;re getting a little common. I have some elegant ones&mdash;not as
      elegant as yours, though&mdash;but of course I don&rsquo;t wear them now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose they are rather common, but still I have a great
      affection for these, because they were given to me by a dear old friend of
      our family named Murphy. He was a very charming man, but very eccentric.
      We always supposed he was an Irishman, but after he got rich he went
      abroad for a year or two, and when he came back you would have been amused
      to see how interested he was in a potato.

      He asked what it was! Now you know that when Providence shapes a mouth
      especially for the accommodation of a potato you can detect that fact at a
      glance when that mouth is in repose&mdash;foreign travel can never remove
      that sign. But he was a very delightful gentleman, and his little foible
      did not hurt him at all. We all have our shams&mdash;I suppose there is a
      sham somewhere about every individual, if we could manage to ferret it
      out. I would so like to go to France. I suppose our society here compares
      very favorably with French society does it not, Mrs. Oreille?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O.&mdash;&ldquo;Not by any means, Miss Hawkins! French society is much more
      elegant&mdash;much more so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura&mdash;&ldquo;I am sorry to hear that. I suppose ours has deteriorated of
      late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O.&mdash;&ldquo;Very much indeed. There are people in society here that
      have really no more money to live on than what some of us pay for servant
      hire. Still I won&rsquo;t say but what some of them are very good people&mdash;and
      respectable, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura&mdash;&ldquo;The old families seem to be holding themselves aloof, from
      what I hear. I suppose you seldom meet in society now, the people you used
      to be familiar with twelve or fifteen years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O.&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, no-hardly ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. O&rsquo;Riley kept his first rum-mill and protected his customers from the
      law in those days, and this turn of the conversation was rather
      uncomfortable to madame than otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hon. Mrs. Higgins&mdash;&ldquo;Is Francois&rsquo; health good now, Mrs. Oreille?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O.&mdash;(Thankful for the intervention)&mdash;&ldquo;Not very. A body
      couldn&rsquo;t expect it. He was always delicate&mdash;especially his lungs&mdash;and
      this odious climate tells on him strong, now, after Parry, which is so
      mild.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. H:&mdash;&ldquo;I should think so. Husband says Percy&rsquo;ll die if he don&rsquo;t
      have a change; and so I&rsquo;m going to swap round a little and see what can be
      done. I saw a lady from Florida last week, and she recommended Key West. I
      told her Percy couldn&rsquo;t abide winds, as he was threatened with a pulmonary
      affection, and then she said try St. Augustine. It&rsquo;s an awful distance&mdash;ten
      or twelve hundred mile, they say but then in a case of this kind&mdash;a
      body can&rsquo;t stand back for trouble, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O.&mdash;&ldquo;No, of course that&rsquo;s off. If Francois don&rsquo;t get better soon
      we&rsquo;ve got to look out for some other place, or else Europe. We&rsquo;ve thought
      some of the Hot Springs, but I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a great responsibility and
      a body wants to go cautious. Is Hildebrand about again, Mrs. Gashly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. G.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, but that&rsquo;s about all. It was indigestion, you know,
      and it looks as if it was chronic. And you know I do dread dyspepsia.
      We&rsquo;ve all been worried a good deal about him. The doctor recommended baked
      apple and spoiled meat, and I think it done him good. It&rsquo;s about the only
      thing that will stay on his stomach now-a-days. We have Dr. Shovel now.
      Who&rsquo;s your doctor, Mrs. Higgins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. H.&mdash;&ldquo;Well, we had Dr. Spooner a good while, but he runs so much
      to emetics, which I think are weakening, that we changed off and took Dr.
      Leathers. We like him very much. He has a fine European reputation, too.
      The first thing he suggested for Percy was to have him taken out in the
      back yard for an airing, every afternoon, with nothing at all on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O. and Mrs. G.&mdash;&ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. H.&mdash;&ldquo;As true as I&rsquo;m sitting here. And it actually helped him for
      two or three days; it did indeed. But after that the doctor said it seemed
      to be too severe and so he has fell back on hot foot-baths at night and
      cold showers in the morning. But I don&rsquo;t think there can be any good sound
      help for him in such a climate as this. I believe we are going to lose him
      if we don&rsquo;t make a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O. &ldquo;I suppose you heard of the fright we had two weeks ago last
      Saturday? No? Why that is strange&mdash;but come to remember, you&rsquo;ve all
      been away to Richmond. Francois tumbled from the sky light&mdash;in the
      second-story hall clean down to the first floor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody&mdash;&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes indeed&mdash;and broke two of his ribs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody&mdash;&ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O. &ldquo;Just as true as you live. First we thought he must be injured
      internally. It was fifteen minutes past 8 in the evening. Of course we
      were all distracted in a moment&mdash;everybody was flying everywhere, and
      nobody doing anything worth anything. By and by I flung out next door and
      dragged in Dr. Sprague; President of the Medical University no time to go
      for our own doctor of course&mdash;and the minute he saw Francois he said,
      &lsquo;Send for your own physician, madam;&rsquo; said it as cross as a bear, too, and
      turned right on his heel, and cleared out without doing a thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody&mdash;&ldquo;The mean, contemptible brute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O&mdash;&ldquo;Well you may say it. I was nearly out of my wits by this
      time. But we hurried off the servants after our own doctor and telegraphed
      mother&mdash;she was in New York and rushed down on the first train; and
      when the doctor got there, lo and behold you he found Francois had broke
      one of his legs, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everybody&mdash;&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O.&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. So he set his leg and bandaged it up, and fixed his
      ribs and gave him a dose of something to quiet down his excitement and put
      him to sleep&mdash;poor thing he was trembling and frightened to death and
      it was pitiful to see him. We had him in my bed&mdash;Mr. Oreille slept in
      the guest room and I laid down beside Francois&mdash;but not to sleep
      bless you no. Bridget and I set up all night, and the doctor staid till
      two in the morning, bless his old heart.&mdash;When mother got there she
      was so used up with anxiety, that she had to go to bed and have the
      doctor; but when she found that Francois was not in immediate danger she
      rallied, and by night she was able to take a watch herself. Well for three
      days and nights we three never left that bedside only to take an hour&rsquo;s
      nap at a time. And then the doctor said Francois was out of danger and if
      ever there was a thankful set, in this world, it was us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s respect for these women had augmented during this conversation,
      naturally enough; affection and devotion are qualities that are able to
      adorn and render beautiful a character that is otherwise unattractive, and
      even repulsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Gashly&mdash;&ldquo;I do believe I should a died if I had been in your
      place, Mrs. Oreille. The time Hildebrand was so low with the pneumonia
      Emmeline and me were all alone with him most of the time and we never took
      a minute&rsquo;s sleep for as much as two days and nights. It was at Newport and
      we wouldn&rsquo;t trust hired nurses. One afternoon he had a fit, and jumped up
      and run out on the portico of the hotel with nothing in the world on and
      the wind a blowing like ice and we after him scared to death; and when the
      ladies and gentlemen saw that he had a fit, every lady scattered for her
      room and not a gentleman lifted his hand to help, the wretches! Well after
      that his life hung by a thread for as much as ten days, and the minute he
      was out of danger Emmeline and me just went to bed sick and worn out. I
      never want to pass through such a time again. Poor dear Francois&mdash;which
      leg did he break, Mrs. Oreille!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O.&mdash;&ldquo;It was his right hand hind leg. Jump down, Francois dear,
      and show the ladies what a cruel limp you&rsquo;ve got yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Francois demurred, but being coaxed and delivered gently upon the floor,
      he performed very satisfactorily, with his &ldquo;right hand hind leg&rdquo; in the
      air. All were affected&mdash;even Laura&mdash;but hers was an affection of
      the stomach. The country-bred girl had not suspected that the little
      whining ten-ounce black and tan reptile, clad in a red embroidered pigmy
      blanket and reposing in Mrs. Oreille&rsquo;s lap all through the visit was the
      individual whose sufferings had been stirring the dormant generosities of
      her nature. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little creature! You might have lost him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. O.&mdash;&ldquo;O pray don&rsquo;t mention it, Miss Hawkins&mdash;it gives me
      such a turn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura&mdash;&ldquo;And Hildebrand and Percy&mdash;are they&mdash;are they like
      this one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. G.&mdash;&ldquo;No, Hilly has considerable Skye blood in him, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. H.&mdash;&ldquo;Percy&rsquo;s the same, only he is two months and ten days older
      and has his ears cropped. His father, Martin Farquhar Tupper, was sickly,
      and died young, but he was the sweetest disposition.&mdash;His mother had
      heart disease but was very gentle and resigned, and a wonderful ratter.&rdquo;
     </p>

        As impossible and exasperating as this conversation may sound to a
        person who is not an idiot, it is scarcely in any respect an
        exaggeration of one which one of us actually listened to in an American
        drawing room&mdash;otherwise we could not venture to put such a chapter
        into a book which, professes to deal with social possibilities.&mdash;THE
        AUTHORS.]

    </blockquote>
    <p>
      So carried away had the visitors become by their interest attaching to
      this discussion of family matters, that their stay had been prolonged to a
      very improper and unfashionable length; but they suddenly recollected
      themselves now and took their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s scorn was boundless. The more she thought of these people and
      their extraordinary talk, the more offensive they seemed to her; and yet
      she confessed that if one must choose between the two extreme
      aristocracies it might be best, on the whole, looking at things from a
      strictly business point of view, to herd with the Parvenus; she was in
      Washington solely to compass a certain matter and to do it at any cost,
      and these people might be useful to her, while it was plain that her
      purposes and her schemes for pushing them would not find favor in the eyes
      of the Antiques. If it came to choice&mdash;and it might come to that,
      sooner or later&mdash;she believed she could come to a decision without
      much difficulty or many pangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the best aristocracy of the three Washington castes, and really the
      most powerful, by far, was that of the Middle Ground: It was made up of
      the families of public men from nearly every state in the Union&mdash;men
      who held positions in both the executive and legislative branches of the
      government, and whose characters had been for years blemishless, both at
      home and at the capital. These gentlemen and their households were
      unostentatious people; they were educated and refined; they troubled
      themselves but little about the two other orders of nobility, but moved
      serenely in their wide orbit, confident in their own strength and well
      aware of the potency of their influence. They had no troublesome
      appearances to keep up, no rivalries which they cared to distress
      themselves about, no jealousies to fret over. They could afford to mind
      their own affairs and leave other combinations to do the same or do
      otherwise, just as they chose. They were people who were beyond reproach,
      and that was sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dilworthy never came into collision with any of these factions. He
      labored for them all and with them all. He said that all men were brethren
      and all were entitled to the honest unselfish help and countenance of a
      Christian laborer in the public vineyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura concluded, after reflection, to let circumstances determine the
      course it might be best for her to pursue as regarded the several
      aristocracies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it might occur to the reader that perhaps Laura had been somewhat
      rudely suggestive in her remarks to Mrs. Oreille when the subject of
      corals was under discussion, but it did not occur to Laura herself. She
      was not a person of exaggerated refinement; indeed, the society and the
      influences that had formed her character had not been of a nature
      calculated to make her so; she thought that &ldquo;give and take was fair play,&rdquo;
       and that to parry an offensive thrust with a sarcasm was a neat and
      legitimate thing to do. She sometimes talked to people in a way which some
      ladies would consider, actually shocking; but Laura rather prided herself
      upon some of her exploits of that character. We are sorry we cannot make
      her a faultless heroine; but we cannot, for the reason that she was human.
    </p>
    <p>
      She considered herself a superior conversationist. Long ago, when the
      possibility had first been brought before her mind that some day she might
      move in Washington society, she had recognized the fact that practiced
      conversational powers would be a necessary weapon in that field; she had
      also recognized the fact that since her dealings there must be mainly with
      men, and men whom she supposed to be exceptionally cultivated and able,
      she would need heavier shot in her magazine than mere brilliant &ldquo;society&rdquo;
       nothings; whereupon she had at once entered upon a tireless and elaborate
      course of reading, and had never since ceased to devote every unoccupied
      moment to this sort of preparation. Having now acquired a happy smattering
      of various information, she used it with good effect&mdash;she passed for
      a singularly well informed woman in Washington. The quality of her
      literary tastes had necessarily undergone constant improvement under this
      regimen, and as necessarily, also the duality of her language had
      improved, though it cannot be denied that now and then her former
      condition of life betrayed itself in just perceptible inelegancies of
      expression and lapses of grammar.

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When Laura had been in Washington three months, she was still the same
      person, in one respect, that she was when she first arrived there&mdash;that
      is to say, she still bore the name of Laura Hawkins. Otherwise she was
      perceptibly changed.&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had arrived in a state of grievous uncertainty as to what manner of
      woman she was, physically and intellectually, as compared with eastern
      women; she was well satisfied, now, that her beauty was confessed, her
      mind a grade above the average, and her powers of fascination rather
      extraordinary. So she was at ease upon those points. When she arrived, she
      was possessed of habits of economy and not possessed of money; now she
      dressed elaborately, gave but little thought to the cost of things, and
      was very well fortified financially. She kept her mother and Washington
      freely supplied with money, and did the same by Col. Sellers&mdash;who
      always insisted upon giving his note for loans&mdash;with interest; he was
      rigid upon that; she must take interest; and one of the Colonel&rsquo;s greatest
      satisfactions was to go over his accounts and note what a handsome sum
      this accruing interest amounted to, and what a comfortable though modest
      support it would yield Laura in case reverses should overtake her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth he could not help feeling that he was an efficient shield for her
      against poverty; and so, if her expensive ways ever troubled him for a
      brief moment, he presently dismissed the thought and said to himself, &ldquo;Let
      her go on&mdash;even if she loses everything she is still safe&mdash;this
      interest will always afford her a good easy income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura was on excellent terms with a great many members of Congress, and
      there was an undercurrent of suspicion in some quarters that she was one
      of that detested class known as &ldquo;lobbyists;&rdquo; but what belle could escape
      slander in such a city? Fairminded people declined to condemn her on mere
      suspicion, and so the injurious talk made no very damaging headway. She
      was very gay, now, and very celebrated, and she might well expect to be
      assailed by many kinds of gossip. She was growing used to celebrity, and
      could already sit calm and seemingly unconscious, under the fire of fifty
      lorgnettes in a theatre, or even overhear the low voice &ldquo;That&rsquo;s she!&rdquo; as
      she passed along the street without betraying annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole air was full of a vague vast scheme which was to eventuate in
      filling Laura&rsquo;s pockets with millions of money; some had one idea of the
      scheme, and some another, but nobody had any exact knowledge upon the
      subject. All that any one felt sure about, was that Laura&rsquo;s landed estates
      were princely in value and extent, and that the government was anxious to
      get hold of them for public purposes, and that Laura was willing to make
      the sale but not at all anxious about the matter and not at all in a
      hurry. It was whispered that Senator Dilworthy was a stumbling block in
      the way of an immediate sale, because he was resolved that the government
      should not have the lands except with the understanding that they should
      be devoted to the uplifting of the negro race; Laura did not care what
      they were devoted to, it was said, (a world of very different gossip to
      the contrary notwithstanding,) but there were several other heirs and they
      would be guided entirely by the Senator&rsquo;s wishes; and finally, many people
      averred that while it would be easy to sell the lands to the government
      for the benefit of the negro, by resorting to the usual methods of
      influencing votes, Senator Dilworthy was unwilling to have so noble a
      charity sullied by any taint of corruption&mdash;he was resolved that not
      a vote should be bought. Nobody could get anything definite from Laura
      about these matters, and so gossip had to feed itself chiefly upon
      guesses. But the effect of it all was, that Laura was considered to be
      very wealthy and likely to be vastly more so in a little while.
      Consequently she was much courted and as much envied: Her wealth attracted
      many suitors. Perhaps they came to worship her riches, but they remained
      to worship her. Some of the noblest men of the time succumbed to her
      fascinations. She frowned upon no lover when he made his first advances,
      but by and by when she was hopelessly enthralled, he learned from her own
      lips that she had formed a resolution never to marry. Then he would go
      away hating and cursing the whole sex, and she would calmly add his scalp
      to her string, while she mused upon the bitter day that Col. Selby
      trampled her love and her pride in the dust. In time it came to be said
      that her way was paved with broken hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Washington gradually woke up to the fact that he too was an
      intellectual marvel as well as his gifted sister. He could not conceive
      how it had come about (it did not occur to him that the gossip about his
      family&rsquo;s great wealth had any thing to do with it). He could not account
      for it by any process of reasoning, and was simply obliged to accept the
      fact and give up trying to solve the riddle. He found himself dragged into
      society and courted, wondered at and envied very much as if he were one of
      those foreign barbers who flit over here now and then with a
      self-conferred title of nobility and marry some rich fool&rsquo;s absurd
      daughter. Sometimes at a dinner party or a reception he would find himself
      the centre of interest, and feel unutterably uncomfortable in the
      discovery. Being obliged to say something, he would mine his brain and put
      in a blast and when the smoke and flying debris had cleared away the
      result would be what seemed to him but a poor little intellectual clod of
      dirt or two, and then he would be astonished to see everybody as lost in
      admiration as if he had brought up a ton or two of virgin gold. Every
      remark he made delighted his hearers and compelled their applause; he
      overheard people say he was exceedingly bright&mdash;they were chiefly
      mammas and marriageable young ladies. He found that some of his good
      things were being repeated about the town. Whenever he heard of an
      instance of this kind, he would keep that particular remark in mind and
      analyze it at home in private. At first he could not see that the remark
      was anything better than a parrot might originate; but by and by he began
      to feel that perhaps he underrated his powers; and after that he used to
      analyze his good things with a deal of comfort, and find in them a
      brilliancy which would have been unapparent to him in earlier days&mdash;and
      then he would make a note of that good thing and say it again the first
      time he found himself in a new company. Presently he had saved up quite a
      repertoire of brilliancies; and after that he confined himself to
      repeating these and ceased to originate any more, lest he might injure his
      reputation by an unlucky effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was constantly having young ladies thrust upon his notice at
      receptions, or left upon his hands at parties, and in time he began to
      feel that he was being deliberately persecuted in this way; and after that
      he could not enjoy society because of his constant dread of these female
      ambushes and surprises. He was distressed to find that nearly every time
      he showed a young lady a polite attention he was straightway reported to
      be engaged to her; and as some of these reports got into the newspapers
      occasionally, he had to keep writing to Louise that they were lies and she
      must believe in him and not mind them or allow them to grieve her.

      Washington was as much in the dark as anybody with regard to the great
      wealth that was hovering in the air and seemingly on the point of tumbling
      into the family pocket. Laura would give him no satisfaction. All she
      would say, was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait. Be patient. You will see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will it be soon, Laura?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be very long, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what makes you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reasons&mdash;and good ones. Just wait, and be patient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is it going to be as much as people say it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do they say it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ever so much. Millions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it will be a great sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how great, Laura? Will it be millions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you may call it that. Yes, it will be millions. There, now&mdash;does
      that satisfy you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid! I can wait. I can wait patiently&mdash;ever so patiently. Once
      I was near selling the land for twenty thousand dollars; once for thirty
      thousand dollars; once after that for seven thousand dollars; and once for
      forty thousand dollars&mdash;but something always told me not to do it.
      What a fool I would have been to sell it for such a beggarly trifle! It is
      the land that&rsquo;s to bring the money, isn&rsquo;t it Laura? You can tell me that
      much, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t mind saying that much. It is the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But mind&mdash;don&rsquo;t ever hint that you got it from me. Don&rsquo;t mention me
      in the matter at all, Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;I won&rsquo;t. Millions! Isn&rsquo;t it splendid! I mean to look
      around for a building lot; a lot with fine ornamental shrubbery and all
      that sort of thing. I will do it to-day. And I might as well see an
      architect, too, and get him to go to work at a plan for a house. I don&rsquo;t
      intend to spare any expense; I mean to have the noblest house that money
      can build.&rdquo; Then after a pause&mdash;he did not notice Laura&rsquo;s smiles
      &ldquo;Laura, would you lay the main hall in encaustic tiles, or just in fancy
      patterns of hard wood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura laughed a good old-fashioned laugh that had more of her former
      natural self about it than any sound that had issued from her mouth in
      many weeks. She said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t change, Washington. You still begin to squander a fortune right
      and left the instant you hear of it in the distance; you never wait till
      the foremost dollar of it arrives within a hundred miles of you,&rdquo; &mdash;and
      she kissed her brother good bye and left him weltering in his dreams, so
      to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and walked the floor feverishly during two hours; and when he
      sat down he had married Louise, built a house, reared a family, married
      them off, spent upwards of eight hundred thousand dollars on mere
      luxuries, and died worth twelve millions.

    </p>
    <p>
      Laura went down stairs, knocked at/the study door, and entered, scarcely
      waiting for the response. Senator Dilworthy was alone&mdash;with an open
      Bible in his hand, upside down. Laura smiled, and said, forgetting her
      acquired correctness of speech,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only me.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, come in, sit down,&rdquo; and the Senator closed the book and laid it down.
      &ldquo;I wanted to see you. Time to report progress from the committee of the
      whole,&rdquo; and the Senator beamed with his own congressional wit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the committee of the whole things are working very well. We have made
      ever so much progress in a week. I believe that you and I together could
      run this government beautifully, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator beamed again. He liked to be called &ldquo;uncle&rdquo; by this beautiful
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see Hopperson last night after the congressional prayer meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He came. He&rsquo;s a kind of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? he is one of my friends, Laura. He&rsquo;s a fine man, a very fine man. I
      don&rsquo;t know any man in congress I&rsquo;d sooner go to for help in any Christian
      work. What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he beat around a little. He said he should like to help the negro,
      his heart went out to the negro, and all that&mdash;plenty of them say
      that but he was a little afraid of the Tennessee Land bill; if Senator
      Dilworthy wasn&rsquo;t in it, he should suspect there was a fraud on the
      government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that, did he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And he said he felt he couldn&rsquo;t vote for it. He was shy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not shy, child, cautious. He&rsquo;s a very cautious man. I have been with him
      a great deal on conference committees. He wants reasons, good ones. Didn&rsquo;t
      you show him he was in error about the bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did. I went over the whole thing. I had to tell him some of the side
      arrangements, some of the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t mention me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. I told him you were daft about the negro and the philanthropy
      part of it, as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daft is a little strong, Laura. But you know that I wouldn&rsquo;t touch this
      bill if it were not for the public good, and for the good of the colored
      race; much as I am interested in the heirs of this property, and would
      like to have them succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura looked a little incredulous, and the Senator proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t misunderstand me, I don&rsquo;t deny that it is for the interest of all
      of us that this bill should go through, and it will. I have no
      concealments from you. But I have one principle in my public life, which I
      should like you to keep in mind; it has always been my guide. I never push
      a private interest if it is not Justified and ennobled by some larger
      public good. I doubt if a Christian would be justified in working for his
      own salvation if it was not to aid in the salvation of his fellow men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator spoke with feeling, and then added,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you showed Hopperson that our motives were pure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he seemed to have a new light on the measure: I think will vote
      for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so; his name will give tone and strength to it. I knew you would
      only have to show him that it was just and pure, in order to secure his
      cordial support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I convinced him. Yes, I am perfectly sure he will vote right
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; said the Senator; smiling, and rubbing his
      hands. &ldquo;Is there anything more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find some changes in that I guess,&rdquo; handing the Senator a printed
      list of names. &ldquo;Those checked off are all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;&lsquo;m&mdash;&lsquo;m,&rdquo; running his eye down the list. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      encouraging. What is the &lsquo;C&rsquo; before some of the names, and the &lsquo;B. B.&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are my private marks. That &lsquo;C&rsquo; stands for &lsquo;convinced,&rsquo; with
      argument. The &lsquo;B. B.&rsquo; is a general sign for a relative. You see it stands
      before three of the Hon. Committee. I expect to see the chairman of the
      committee to-day, Mr. Buckstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, you must, he ought to be seen without any delay. Buckstone is a
      worldly sort of a fellow, but he has charitable impulses. If we secure him
      we shall have a favorable report by the committee, and it will be a great
      thing to be able to state that fact quietly where it will do good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I saw Senator Balloon&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will help us, I suppose? Balloon is a whole-hearted fellow. I can&rsquo;t
      help loving that man, for all his drollery and waggishness. He puts on an
      air of levity sometimes, but there aint a man in the senate knows the
      scriptures as he does. He did not make any objections?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly, he said&mdash;shall I tell you what he said?&rdquo; asked Laura
      glancing furtively at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he had no doubt it was a good thing; if Senator Dilworthy was in
      it, it would pay to look into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator laughed, but rather feebly, and said, &ldquo;Balloon is always full
      of his jokes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I explained it to him. He said it was all right, he only wanted a word
      with you,&rdquo;, continued Laura. &ldquo;He is a handsome old gentleman, and he is
      gallant for an old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; said the Senator, with a grave look, &ldquo;I trust there was
      nothing free in his manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free?&rdquo; repeated Laura, with indignation in her face. &ldquo;With me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, child. I meant nothing, Balloon talks a little freely
      sometimes, with men. But he is right at heart. His term expires next year
      and I fear we shall lose him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He seemed to be packing the day I was there. His rooms were full of dry
      goods boxes, into which his servant was crowding all manner of old clothes
      and stuff: I suppose he will paint &lsquo;Pub. Docs&rsquo; on them and frank them
      home. That&rsquo;s good economy, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, but child, all Congressmen do that. It may not be strictly
      honest, indeed it is not unless he had some public documents mixed in with
      the clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny world. Good-bye, uncle. I&rsquo;m going to see that chairman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And humming a cheery opera air, she departed to her room to dress for
      going out. Before she did that, however, she took out her note book and
      was soon deep in its contents; marking, dashing, erasing, figuring, and
      talking to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free! I wonder what Dilworthy does think of me anyway? One . . . two . .
      . eight . . . seventeen . . . twenty-one . . . &lsquo;m&rsquo;m . . . it takes a heap
      for a majority. Wouldn&rsquo;t Dilworthy open his eyes if he knew some of the
      things Balloon did say to me. There . . . . Hopperson&rsquo;s influence ought to
      count twenty . . . the sanctimonious old curmudgeon. Son-in-law . . .
      sinecure in the negro institution. . . . That about gauges him. . . . The
      three committeemen . . . sons-in-law. Nothing like a son-in-law here in
      Washington or a brother-in-law. . . . And everybody has &lsquo;em. . . .Let&rsquo;s
      see: . . . sixty-one. . . . with places . . . twenty-five . . . persuaded&mdash;it
      is getting on; . . . . we&rsquo;ll have two-thirds of Congress in time . . .
      Dilworthy must surely know I understand him. Uncle Dilworthy . . . . Uncle
      Balloon!&mdash;Tells very amusing stories . . . when ladies are not
      present . . . I should think so . . . .&lsquo;m . . . &lsquo;m. Eighty-five. There. I
      must find that chairman. Queer. . . . Buckstone acts. . . . Seemed to be
      in love . . . . . I was sure of it. He promised to come here . . . and he
      hasn&rsquo;t. . . . Strange. Very strange . . . . I must chance to meet him
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura dressed and went out, thinking she was perhaps too early for Mr.
      Buckstone to come from the house, but as he lodged near the bookstore she
      would drop in there and keep a look out for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Laura is on her errand to find Mr. Buckstone, it may not be out of
      the way to remark that she knew quite as much of Washington life as
      Senator Dilworthy gave her credit for, and more than she thought proper to
      tell him. She was acquainted by this time with a good many of the young
      fellows of Newspaper Row; and exchanged gossip with them to their mutual
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were always talking in the Row, everlastingly gossiping, bantering
      and sarcastically praising things, and going on in a style which was a
      curious commingling of earnest and persiflage. Col. Sellers liked this
      talk amazingly, though he was sometimes a little at sea in it&mdash;and
      perhaps that didn&rsquo;t lessen the relish of the conversation to the
      correspondents.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that they had got hold of the dry-goods box packing story about
      Balloon, one day, and were talking it over when the Colonel came in. The
      Colonel wanted to know all about it, and Hicks told him. And then Hicks
      went on, with a serious air,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel, if you register a letter, it means that it is of value, doesn&rsquo;t
      it? And if you pay fifteen cents for registering it, the government will
      have to take extra care of it and even pay you back its full value if it
      is lost. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I suppose it&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well Senator Balloon put fifteen cents worth of stamps on each of those
      seven huge boxes of old clothes, and shipped that ton of second-hand
      rubbish, old boots and pantaloons and what not through the mails as
      registered matter! It was an ingenious thing and it had a genuine touch of
      humor about it, too. I think there is more real talent among our public
      men of to-day than there was among those of old times&mdash;a far more
      fertile fancy, a much happier ingenuity. Now, Colonel, can you picture
      Jefferson, or Washington or John Adams franking their wardrobes through
      the mails and adding the facetious idea of making the government
      responsible for the cargo for the sum of one dollar and five cents?
      Statesmen were dull creatures in those days. I have a much greater
      admiration for Senator Balloon.&rdquo;

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Balloon is a man of parts, there is no denying it&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. He is spoken of for the post of Minister to China, or
      Austria, and I hope will be appointed. What we want abroad is good
      examples of the national character.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Jay and Benjamin Franklin were well enough in their day, but the
      nation has made progress since then. Balloon is a man we know and can
      depend on to be true to himself.&rdquo;

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and Balloon has had a good deal of public experience. He is an old
      friend of mine. He was governor of one of the territories a while, and was
      very satisfactory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed he was. He was ex-officio Indian agent, too. Many a man would have
      taken the Indian appropriation and devoted the money to feeding and
      clothing the helpless savages, whose land had been taken from them by the
      white man in the interests of civilization; but Balloon knew their needs
      better. He built a government saw-mill on the reservation with the money,
      and the lumber sold for enormous prices&mdash;a relative of his did all
      the work free of charge&mdash;that is to say he charged nothing more than
      the lumber would bring.&rdquo; &ldquo;But the poor Injuns&mdash;not that I care much
      for Injuns&mdash;what did he do for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gave them the outside slabs to fence in the reservation with. Governor
      Balloon was nothing less than a father to the poor Indians. But Balloon is
      not alone, we have many truly noble statesmen in our country&rsquo;s service
      like Balloon. The Senate is full of them. Don&rsquo;t you think so Colonel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I dunno. I honor my country&rsquo;s public servants as much as any one
      can. I meet them, Sir, every day, and the more I see of them the more I
      esteem them and the more grateful I am that our institutions give us the
      opportunity of securing their services. Few lands are so blest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, Colonel. To be sure you can buy now and then a Senator or a
      Representative but they do not know it is wrong, and so they are not
      ashamed of it. They are gentle, and confiding and childlike, and in my
      opinion these are qualities that ennoble them far more than any amount of
      sinful sagacity could. I quite agree with you, Col. Sellers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;hesitated the Colonel&mdash;&ldquo;I am afraid some of them do buy
      their seats&mdash;yes, I am afraid they do&mdash;but as Senator Dilworthy
      himself said to me, it is sinful,&mdash;it is very wrong&mdash;it is
      shameful; Heaven protect me from such a charge. That is what Dilworthy
      said. And yet when you come to look at it you cannot deny that we would
      have to go without the services of some of our ablest men, sir, if the
      country were opposed to&mdash;to&mdash;bribery. It is a harsh term. I do
      not like to use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel interrupted himself at this point to meet an engagement with
      the Austrian minister, and took his leave with his usual courtly bow.

      In due time Laura alighted at the book store, and began to look at the
      titles of the handsome array of books on the counter. A dapper clerk of
      perhaps nineteen or twenty years, with hair accurately parted and
      surprisingly slick, came bustling up and leaned over with a pretty smile
      and an affable&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I&mdash;was there any particular book you wished to see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you Taine&rsquo;s England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taine&rsquo;s Notes on England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman scratched the side of his nose with a cedar pencil
      which he took down from its bracket on the side of his head, and reflected
      a moment:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;I see,&rdquo; [with a bright smile]&mdash;&ldquo;Train, you mean&mdash;not
      Taine. George Francis Train. No, ma&rsquo;m we&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean Taine&mdash;if I may take the liberty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk reflected again&mdash;then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Taine . . . . Taine . . . . Is it hymns?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t hymns. It is a volume that is making a deal of talk just
      now, and is very widely known&mdash;except among parties who sell it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk glanced at her face to see if a sarcasm might not lurk somewhere
      in that obscure speech, but the gentle simplicity of the beautiful eyes
      that met his, banished that suspicion. He went away and conferred with the
      proprietor. Both appeared to be non-plussed. They thought and talked, and
      talked and thought by turns. Then both came forward and the proprietor
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it an American book, ma&rsquo;m?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is an American reprint of an English translation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;I remember, now. We are expecting it every day.
      It isn&rsquo;t out yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you must be mistaken, because you advertised it a week ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no&mdash;can that be so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am sure of it. And besides, here is the book itself, on the
      counter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bought it and the proprietor retired from the field. Then she asked
      the clerk for the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table&mdash;and was pained to
      see the admiration her beauty had inspired in him fade out of his face. He
      said with cold dignity, that cook books were somewhat out of their line,
      but he would order it if she desired it. She said, no, never mind. Then
      she fell to conning the titles again, finding a delight in the inspection
      of the Hawthornes, the Longfellows, the Tennysons, and other favorites of
      her idle hours. Meantime the clerk&rsquo;s eyes were busy, and no doubt his
      admiration was returning again&mdash;or may be he was only gauging her
      probable literary tastes by some sagacious system of admeasurement only
      known to his guild. Now he began to &ldquo;assist&rdquo; her in making a selection;
      but his efforts met with no success&mdash;indeed they only annoyed her and
      unpleasantly interrupted her meditations. Presently, while she was holding
      a copy of &ldquo;Venetian Life&rdquo; in her hand and running over a familiar passage
      here and there, the clerk said, briskly, snatching up a paper-covered
      volume and striking the counter a smart blow with it to dislodge the dust:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now here is a work that we&rsquo;ve sold a lot of. Everybody that&rsquo;s read it
      likes it&rdquo;&mdash;and he intruded it under her nose; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a book that I can
      recommend&mdash;&lsquo;The Pirate&rsquo;s Doom, or the Last of the Buccaneers.&rsquo; I
      think it&rsquo;s one of the best things that&rsquo;s come out this season.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura pushed it gently aside with her hand and went on and went on
      filching from &ldquo;Venetian Life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I do not want it,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk hunted around awhile, glancing at one title and then another,
      but apparently not finding what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, he succeeded at last. Said he:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever read this, ma&rsquo;m? I am sure you&rsquo;ll like it. It&rsquo;s by the
      author of &lsquo;The Hooligans of Hackensack.&rsquo; It is full of love troubles and
      mysteries and all sorts of such things. The heroine strangles her own
      mother. Just glance at the title please,&mdash;&lsquo;Gonderil the Vampire, or
      The Dance of Death.&rsquo; And here is &lsquo;The Jokist&rsquo;s Own Treasury, or, The
      Phunny Phellow&rsquo;s Bosom Phriend.&rsquo; The funniest thing!&mdash;I&rsquo;ve read it
      four times, ma&rsquo;m, and I can laugh at the very sight of it yet. And
      &lsquo;Gonderil,&rsquo;&mdash;I assure you it is the most splendid book I ever read. I
      know you will like these books, ma&rsquo;m, because I&rsquo;ve read them myself and I
      know what they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I was perplexed&mdash;but I see how it is, now. You must have thought
      I asked you to tell me what sort of books I wanted&mdash;for I am apt to
      say things which I don&rsquo;t really mean, when I am absent minded. I suppose I
      did ask you, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No ma&rsquo;m,&mdash;but I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I must have done it, else you would not have offered your services,
      for fear it might be rude. But don&rsquo;t be troubled&mdash;it was all my
      fault. I ought not to have been so heedless&mdash;I ought not to have
      asked you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t ask me, ma&rsquo;m. We always help customers all we can. You see
      our experience&mdash;living right among books all the time&mdash;that sort
      of thing makes us able to help a customer make a selection, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now does it, indeed? It is part of your business, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, we always help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good it is of you. Some people would think it rather obtrusive,
      perhaps, but I don&rsquo;t&mdash;I think it is real kindness&mdash;even charity.
      Some people jump to conclusions without any thought&mdash;you have noticed
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes,&rdquo; said the clerk, a little perplexed as to whether to feel
      comfortable or the reverse; &ldquo;Oh yes, indeed, I&rsquo;ve often noticed that,
      ma&rsquo;m.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they jump to conclusions with an absurd heedlessness. Now some
      people would think it odd that because you, with the budding tastes and
      the innocent enthusiasms natural to your time of life, enjoyed the
      Vampires and the volume of nursery jokes, you should imagine that an older
      person would delight in them too&mdash;but I do not think it odd at all. I
      think it natural&mdash;perfectly natural in you. And kind, too. You look
      like a person who not only finds a deep pleasure in any little thing in
      the way of literature that strikes you forcibly, but is willing and glad
      to share that pleasure with others&mdash;and that, I think, is noble and
      admirable&mdash;very noble and admirable. I think we ought all to share
      our pleasures with others, and do what we can to make each other happy, do
      not you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. Oh, yes, indeed. Yes, you are quite right, ma&rsquo;m.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was getting unmistakably uncomfortable, now, notwithstanding
      Laura&rsquo;s confiding sociability and almost affectionate tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed. Many people would think that what a bookseller&mdash;or
      perhaps his clerk&mdash;knows about literature as literature, in
      contradistinction to its character as merchandise, would hardly, be of
      much assistance to a person&mdash;that is, to an adult, of course&mdash;in
      the selection of food for the mind&mdash;except of course wrapping paper,
      or twine, or wafers, or something like that&mdash;but I never feel that
      way. I feel that whatever service you offer me, you offer with a good
      heart, and I am as grateful for it as if it were the greatest boon to me.
      And it is useful to me&mdash;it is bound to be so. It cannot be otherwise.
      If you show me a book which you have read&mdash;not skimmed over or merely
      glanced at, but read&mdash;and you tell me that you enjoyed it and that
      you could read it three or four times, then I know what book I want&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&mdash;th&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;&ldquo;to avoid. Yes indeed. I think that no information ever comes amiss
      in this world. Once or twice I have traveled in the cars&mdash;and there
      you know, the peanut boy always measures you with his eye, and hands you
      out a book of murders if you are fond of theology; or Tupper or a
      dictionary or T. S. Arthur if you are fond of poetry; or he hands you a
      volume of distressing jokes or a copy of the American Miscellany if you
      particularly dislike that sort of literary fatty degeneration of the heart&mdash;just
      for the world like a pleasant spoken well-meaning gentleman in any
      bookstore. But here I am running on as if business men had nothing to do
      but listen to women talk. You must pardon me, for I was not thinking.&mdash;And
      you must let me thank you again for helping me. I read a good deal, and
      shall be in nearly every day and I would be sorry to have you think me a
      customer who talks too much and buys too little. Might I ask you to give
      me the time? Ah-two-twenty-two. Thank you very much. I will set mine while
      I have the opportunity.&rdquo;

      But she could not get her watch open, apparently. She tried, and tried
      again. Then the clerk, trembling at his own audacity, begged to be allowed
      to assist. She allowed him. He succeeded, and was radiant under the sweet
      influences of her pleased face and her seductively worded acknowledgements
      with gratification. Then he gave her the exact time again, and anxiously
      watched her turn the hands slowly till they reached the precise spot
      without accident or loss of life, and then he looked as happy as a man who
      had helped a fellow being through a momentous undertaking, and was
      grateful to know that he had not lived in vain. Laura thanked him once
      more. The words were music to his ear; but what were they compared to the
      ravishing smile with which she flooded his whole system? When she bowed
      her adieu and turned away, he was no longer suffering torture in the
      pillory where she had had him trussed up during so many distressing
      moments, but he belonged to the list of her conquests and was a flattered
      and happy thrall, with the dawn-light of love breaking over the eastern
      elevations of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about the hour, now, for the chairman of the House Committee on
      Benevolent Appropriations to make his appearance, and Laura stepped to the
      door to reconnoiter. She glanced up the street, and sure enough&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="ch37" id="ch37"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That Chairman was nowhere in sight. Such disappointments seldom occur in
      novels, but are always happening in real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was obliged to make a new plan. She sent him a note, and asked him to
      call in the evening&mdash;which he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      She received the Hon. Mr. Buckstone with a sunny smile, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I ever dared to send you a note, Mr. Buckstone, for you
      have the reputation of not being very partial to our sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I am sure my reputation does me wrong, then, Miss Hawkins. I have
      been married once&mdash;is that nothing in my favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;that is, it may be and it may not be. If you have known
      what perfection is in woman, it is fair to argue that inferiority cannot
      interest you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if that were the case it could not affect you, Miss Hawkins,&rdquo; said
      the chairman gallantly. &ldquo;Fame does not place you in the list of ladies who
      rank below perfection.&rdquo; This happy speech delighted Mr. Buckstone as much
      as it seemed to delight Laura. But it did not confuse him as much as it
      apparently did her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish in all sincerity that I could be worthy of such a felicitous
      compliment as that. But I am a woman, and so I am gratified for it just as
      it is, and would not have it altered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not merely a compliment&mdash;that is, an empty complement&mdash;it
      is the truth. All men will endorse that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura looked pleased, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very kind of you to say it. It is a distinction indeed, for a
      country-bred girl like me to be so spoken of by people of brains and
      culture. You are so kind that I know you will pardon my putting you to the
      trouble to come this evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it was no trouble. It was a pleasure. I am alone in the world
      since I lost my wife, and I often long for the society of your sex, Miss
      Hawkins, notwithstanding what people may say to the contrary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is pleasant to hear you say that. I am sure it must be so. If I feel
      lonely at times, because of my exile from old friends, although surrounded
      by new ones who are already very dear to me, how much more lonely must you
      feel, bereft as you are, and with no wholesome relief from the cares of
      state that weigh you down. For your own sake, as well as for the sake of
      others, you ought to go into society oftener. I seldom see you at a
      reception, and when I do you do not usually give me very much of your
      attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never imagined that you wished it or I would have been very glad to
      make myself happy in that way.&mdash;But one seldom gets an opportunity to
      say more than a sentence to you in a place like that. You are always the
      centre of a group&mdash;a fact which you may have noticed yourself. But if
      one might come here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you would always find a hearty welcome, Mr. Buckstone. I have
      often wished you would come and tell me more about Cairo and the Pyramids,
      as you once promised me you would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you remember that yet, Miss Hawkins? I thought ladies&rsquo; memories
      were more fickle than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they are not so fickle as gentlemen&rsquo;s promises. And besides, if I had
      been inclined to forget, I&mdash;did you not give me something by way of a
      remembrancer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does seem to me that I did; but I have forgotten what it was now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never call a lady&rsquo;s memory fickle again! Do you recognize this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little spray of box! I am beaten&mdash;I surrender. But have you kept
      that all this time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p337" id="p337"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s confusion was very pretty. She tried to hide it, but the more she
      tried the more manifest it became and withal the more captivating to look
      upon. Presently she threw the spray of box from her with an annoyed air,
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot myself. I have been very foolish. I beg that you will forget
      this absurd thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Buckstone picked up the spray, and sitting down by Laura&rsquo;s side on the
      sofa, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please let me keep it, Miss Hawkins. I set a very high value upon it
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me, Mr. Buckstone, and do not speak so. I have been
      sufficiently punished for my thoughtlessness. You cannot take pleasure in
      adding to my distress. Please give it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do not wish to distress you. But do not consider the matter so
      gravely; you have done yourself no wrong. You probably forgot that you had
      it; but if you had given it to me I would have kept it&mdash;and not
      forgotten it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not talk so, Mr. Buckstone. Give it to me, please, and forget the
      matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not be kind to refuse, since it troubles you so, and so I
      restore it. But if you would give me part of it and keep the rest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you might have something to remind you of me when you wished to
      laugh at my foolishness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, by no means, no! Simply that I might remember that I had once
      assisted to discomfort you, and be reminded to do so no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura looked up, and scanned his face a moment. She was about to break the
      twig, but she hesitated and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were sure that you&mdash;&rdquo; She threw the spray away, and continued:
      &ldquo;This is silly! We will change the subject. No, do not insist&mdash;I must
      have my way in this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Buckstone drew off his forces and proceeded to make a wily
      advance upon the fortress under cover of carefully-contrived artifices and
      stratagems of war. But he contended with an alert and suspicious enemy;
      and so at the end of two hours it was manifest to him that he had made but
      little progress. Still, he had made some; he was sure of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura sat alone and communed with herself;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is fairly hooked, poor thing. I can play him at my leisure and land
      him when I choose. He was all ready to be caught, days and days ago&mdash;I
      saw that, very well. He will vote for our bill&mdash;no fear about that;
      and moreover he will work for it, too, before I am done with him. If he
      had a woman&rsquo;s eyes he would have noticed that the spray of box had grown
      three inches since he first gave it to me, but a man never sees anything
      and never suspects. If I had shown him a whole bush he would have thought
      it was the same. Well, it is a good night&rsquo;s work: the committee is safe.
      But this is a desperate game I am playing in these days&mdash;a wearing,
      sordid, heartless game. If I lose, I lose everything&mdash;even myself.
      And if I win the game, will it be worth its cost after all? I do not know.
      Sometimes I doubt. Sometimes I half wish I had not begun. But no matter; I
      have begun, and I will never turn back; never while I live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Buckstone indulged in a reverie as he walked homeward:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is shrewd and deep, and plays her cards with considerable discretion&mdash;but
      she will lose, for all that. There is no hurry; I shall come out winner,
      all in good time. She is the most beautiful woman in the world; and she
      surpassed herself to-night. I suppose I must vote for that bill, in the
      end maybe; but that is not a matter of much consequence the government can
      stand it. She is bent on capturing me, that is plain; but she will find by
      and by that what she took for a sleeping garrison was an ambuscade.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think he is distinguished looking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! That gawky looking person, with Miss Hawkins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There. He&rsquo;s just speaking to Mrs. Schoonmaker. Such high-bred negligence
      and unconsciousness. Nothing studied. See his fine eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very. They are moving this way now. Maybe he is coming here. But he looks
      as helpless as a rag baby. Who is he, Blanche?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is he? And you&rsquo;ve been here a week, Grace, and don&rsquo;t know? He&rsquo;s the
      catch of the season. That&rsquo;s Washington Hawkins&mdash;her brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very old family, old Kentucky family I believe. He&rsquo;s got enormous landed
      property in Tennessee, I think. The family lost everything, slaves and
      that sort of thing, you know, in the war. But they have a great deal of
      land, minerals, mines and all that. Mr. Hawkins and his sister too are
      very much interested in the amelioration of the condition of the colored
      race; they have some plan, with Senator Dilworthy, to convert a large part
      of their property to something another for the freedmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so? I thought he was some guy from Pennsylvania. But he is
      different from others. Probably he has lived all his life on his
      plantation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a day reception of Mrs. Representative Schoonmaker, a sweet woman,
      of simple and sincere manners. Her house was one of the most popular in
      Washington. There was less ostentation there than in some others, and
      people liked to go where the atmosphere reminded them of the peace and
      purity of home. Mrs. Schoonmaker was as natural and unaffected in
      Washington society as she was in her own New York house, and kept up the
      spirit of home-life there, with her husband and children. And that was the
      reason, probably, why people of refinement liked to go there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington is a microcosm, and one can suit himself with any sort of
      society within a radius of a mile. To a large portion of the people who
      frequent Washington or dwell there, the ultra fashion, the shoddy, the
      jobbery are as utterly distasteful as they would be in a refined New
      England City. Schoonmaker was not exactly a leader in the House, but he
      was greatly respected for his fine talents and his honesty. No one would
      have thought of offering to carry National Improvement Directors Relief
      stock for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      These day receptions were attended by more women than men, and those
      interested in the problem might have studied the costumes of the ladies
      present, in view of this fact, to discover whether women dress more for
      the eyes of women or for effect upon men. It is a very important problem,
      and has been a good deal discussed, and its solution would form one fixed,
      philosophical basis, upon which to estimate woman&rsquo;s character. We are
      inclined to take a medium ground, and aver that woman dresses to please
      herself, and in obedience to a law of her own nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are coming this way,&rdquo; said Blanche. People who made way for them to
      pass, turned to look at them. Washington began to feel that the eyes of
      the public were on him also, and his eyes rolled about, now towards the
      ceiling, now towards the floor, in an effort to look unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Miss Hawkins. Delighted. Mr. Hawkins. My friend, Miss
      Medlar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hawkins, who was endeavoring to square himself for a bow, put his foot
      through the train of Mrs. Senator Poplin, who looked round with a scowl,
      which turned into a smile as she saw who it was. In extricating himself,
      Mr. Hawkins, who had the care of his hat as well as the introduction on
      his mind, shambled against Miss Blanche, who said pardon, with the
      prettiest accent, as if the awkwardness were her own. And Mr. Hawkins
      righted himself.

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find it very warm to-day, Mr. Hawkins?&rdquo; said Blanche, by way of
      a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awful hot,&rdquo; said Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s warm for the season,&rdquo; continued Blanche pleasantly. &ldquo;But I suppose
      you are accustomed to it,&rdquo; she added, with a general idea that the
      thermometer always stands at 90 deg. in all parts of the late slave
      states. &ldquo;Washington weather generally cannot be very congenial to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s congenial,&rdquo; said Washington brightening up, &ldquo;when it&rsquo;s not
      congealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s very good. Did you hear, Grace, Mr. Hawkins says it&rsquo;s congenial
      when it&rsquo;s not congealed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is, dear?&rdquo; said Grace, who was talking with Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was now finely under way. Washington launched out an
      observation of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see those Japs, Miss Leavitt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, aren&rsquo;t they queer. But so high-bred, so picturesque. Do you
      think that color makes any difference, Mr. Hawkins? I used to be so
      prejudiced against color.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? I never was. I used to think my old mammy was handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How interesting your life must have been! I should like to hear about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington was about settling himself into his narrative style, when Mrs.
      Gen. McFingal caught his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you been at the Capitol to-day, Mr. Hawkins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington had not. &ldquo;Is anything uncommon going on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say it was very exciting. The Alabama business you know. Gen.
      Sutler, of Massachusetts, defied England, and they say he wants war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to make himself conspicuous more like,&rdquo; said Laura. &ldquo;He always,
      you have noticed, talks with one eye on the gallery, while the other is on
      the speaker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my husband says, its nonsense to talk of war, and wicked. He knows
      what war is. If we do have war, I hope it will be for the patriots of
      Cuba. Don&rsquo;t you think we want Cuba, Mr. Hawkins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we want it bad,&rdquo; said Washington. &ldquo;And Santo Domingo. Senator
      Dilworthy says, we are bound to extend our religion over the isles of the
      sea. We&rsquo;ve got to round out our territory, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington&rsquo;s further observations were broken off by Laura, who whisked
      him off to another part of the room, and reminded him that they must make
      their adieux.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How stupid and tiresome these people are,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were turning to say good-by to the hostess, when Laura&rsquo;s attention
      was arrested by the sight of a gentleman who was just speaking to Mrs.
      Schoonmaker. For a second her heart stopped beating. He was a handsome man
      of forty and perhaps more, with grayish hair and whiskers, and he walked
      with a cane, as if he were slightly lame. He might be less than forty, for
      his face was worn into hard lines, and he was pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. It could not be, she said to herself. It is only a resemblance. But as
      the gentleman turned and she saw his full face, Laura put out her hand and
      clutched Washington&rsquo;s arm to prevent herself from falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington, who was not minding anything, as usual, looked &lsquo;round in
      wonder. Laura&rsquo;s eyes were blazing fire and hatred; he had never seen her
      look so before; and her face, was livid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what is it, sis? Your face is as white as paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s he, it&rsquo;s he. Come, come,&rdquo; and she dragged him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p344" id="p344"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s who?&rdquo; asked Washington, when they had gained the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nobody, it&rsquo;s nothing. Did I say he? I was faint with the heat. Don&rsquo;t
      mention it. Don&rsquo;t you speak of it,&rdquo; she added earnestly, grasping his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had gained her room she went to the glass and saw a pallid and
      haggard face.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p345" id="p345"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p345.jpg (28K)" src="images/p345.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;this will never do. I should have killed him, if I
      could. The scoundrel still lives, and dares to come here. I ought to kill
      him. He has no right to live. How I hate him. And yet I loved him. Oh
      heavens, how I did love that man. And why didn&rsquo;t he kill me? He might
      better. He did kill all that was good in me. Oh, but he shall not escape.
      He shall not escape this time. He may have forgotten. He will find that a
      woman&rsquo;s hate doesn&rsquo;t forget. The law? What would the law do but protect
      him and make me an outcast? How all Washington would gather up its
      virtuous skirts and avoid me, if it knew. I wonder if he hates me as I do
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Laura raved, in tears and in rage by turns, tossed in a tumult of
      passion, which she gave way to with little effort to control.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant came to summon her to dinner. She had a headache. The hour came
      for the President&rsquo;s reception. She had a raving headache, and the Senator
      must go without her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night of agony was like another night she recalled. How vividly it
      all came back to her. And at that time she remembered she thought she
      might be mistaken. He might come back to her. Perhaps he loved her, a
      little, after all. Now, she knew he did not. Now, she knew he was a
      cold-blooded scoundrel, without pity. Never a word in all these years. She
      had hoped he was dead. Did his wife live, she wondered. She caught at that&mdash;and
      it gave a new current to her thoughts. Perhaps, after all&mdash;she must
      see him. She could not live without seeing him. Would he smile as in the
      old days when she loved him so; or would he sneer as when she last saw
      him? If he looked so, she hated him. If he should call her &ldquo;Laura,
      darling,&rdquo; and look SO! She must find him. She must end her doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura kept her room for two days, on one excuse and another&mdash;a
      nervous headache, a cold&mdash;to the great anxiety of the Senator&rsquo;s
      household. Callers, who went away, said she had been too gay&mdash;they
      did not say &ldquo;fast,&rdquo; though some of them may have thought it. One so
      conspicuous and successful in society as Laura could not be out of the way
      two days, without remarks being made, and not all of them complimentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she came down she appeared as usual, a little pale may be, but
      unchanged in manner. If there were any deepened lines about the eyes they
      had been concealed. Her course of action was quite determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      At breakfast she asked if any one had heard any unusual noise during the
      night? Nobody had. Washington never heard any noise of any kind after his
      eyes were shut. Some people thought he never did when they were open
      either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dilworthy said he had come in late. He was detained in a little
      consultation after the Congressional prayer meeting. Perhaps it was his
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Laura said. She heard that. It was later. She might have been nervous,
      but she fancied somebody was trying to get into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brierly humorously suggested that it might be, as none of the members
      were occupied in night session.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator frowned, and said he did not like to hear that kind of
      newspaper slang. There might be burglars about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura said that very likely it was only her nervousness. But she thought
      she would feel safer if Washington would let her take one of his pistols.
      Washington brought her one of his revolvers, and instructed her in the art
      of loading and firing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the morning Laura drove down to Mrs. Schoonmaker&rsquo;s to pay a
      friendly call.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your receptions are always delightful,&rdquo; she said to that lady, &ldquo;the
      pleasant people all seem to come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pleasant to hear you say so, Miss Hawkins. I believe my friends like
      to come here. Though society in Washington is mixed; we have a little of
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, though, you don&rsquo;t see much of the old rebel element?&rdquo; said
      Laura with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this seemed to Mrs. Schoonmaker a singular remark for a lady to make,
      who was meeting &ldquo;rebels&rdquo; in society every day, she did not express it in
      any way, but only said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know we don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;rebel&rsquo; anymore. Before we came to Washington I
      thought rebels would look unlike other people. I find we are very much
      alike, and that kindness and good nature wear away prejudice. And then you
      know there are all sorts of common interests. My husband sometimes says
      that he doesn&rsquo;t see but confederates are just as eager to get at the
      treasury as Unionists. You know that Mr. Schoonmaker is on the
      appropriations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he know many Southerners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. There were several at my reception the other day. Among others a
      confederate Colonel&mdash;a stranger&mdash;handsome man with gray hair,
      probably you didn&rsquo;t notice him, uses a cane in walking. A very agreeable
      man. I wondered why he called. When my husband came home and looked over
      the cards, he said he had a cotton claim. A real southerner. Perhaps you
      might know him if I could think of his name. Yes, here&rsquo;s his card&mdash;Louisiana.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura took the card, looked at it intently till she was sure of the
      address, and then laid it down, with,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he is no friend of ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon, Laura wrote and dispatched the following note. It was in a
      round hand, unlike her flowing style, and it was directed to a number and
      street in Georgetown:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A Lady at Senator Dilworthy&rsquo;s would like to see Col. George Selby, on
        business connected with the Cotton Claims. Can he call Wednesday at
        three o&rsquo;clock P. M.?&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On Wednesday at 3 P. M, no one of the family was likely to be in the house
      except Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="ch39" id="ch39"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Selby had just come to Washington, and taken lodgings in Georgetown.
      His business was to get pay for some cotton that was destroyed during the
      war. There were many others in Washington on the same errand, some of them
      with claims as difficult to establish as his. A concert of action was
      necessary, and he was not, therefore, at all surprised to receive the note
      from a lady asking him to call at Senator Dilworthy&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a little after three on Wednesday he rang the bell of the Senator&rsquo;s
      residence. It was a handsome mansion on the Square opposite the
      President&rsquo;s house. The owner must be a man of great wealth, the Colonel
      thought; perhaps, who knows, said he with a smile, he may have got some of
      my cotton in exchange for salt and quinine after the capture of New
      Orleans. As this thought passed through his mind he was looking at the
      remarkable figure of the Hero of New Orleans, holding itself by main
      strength from sliding off the back of the rearing bronze horse, and
      lifting its hat in the manner of one who acknowledges the playing of that
      martial air: &ldquo;See, the Conquering Hero Comes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Gad,&rdquo; said the Colonel to
      himself, &ldquo;Old Hickory ought to get down and give his seat to Gen. Sutler&mdash;but
      they&rsquo;d have to tie him on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura was in the drawing room. She heard the bell, she heard the steps in
      the hall, and the emphatic thud of the supporting cane. She had risen from
      her chair and was leaning against the piano, pressing her left hand
      against the violent beating of her heart. The door opened and the Colonel
      entered, standing in the full light of the opposite window. Laura was more
      in the shadow and stood for an instant, long enough for the Colonel to
      make the inward observation that she was a magnificent Woman. She then
      advanced a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Col. Selby, is it not?&rdquo;

      The Colonel staggered back, caught himself by a chair, and turned towards
      her a look of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura? My God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your wife!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, it can&rsquo;t be. How came you here? I thought you were&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought I was dead? You thought you were rid of me? Not so long as
      you live, Col. Selby, not so long as you live,&rdquo; Laura in her passion was
      hurried on to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man had ever accused Col. Selby of cowardice. But he was a coward
      before this woman. May be he was not the man he once was. Where was his
      coolness? Where was his sneering, imperturbable manner, with which he
      could have met, and would have met, any woman he had wronged, if he had
      only been forewarned. He felt now that he must temporize, that he must
      gain time. There was danger in Laura&rsquo;s tone. There was something frightful
      in her calmness. Her steady eyes seemed to devour him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have ruined my life,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and I was so young, so ignorant, and
      loved you so. You betrayed me, and left me, mocking me and trampling me
      into the dust, a soiled cast-off. You might better have killed me then.
      Then I should not have hated you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura,&rdquo; said the Colonel, nerving himself, but still pale, and speaking
      appealingly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say that. Reproach me. I deserve it. I was a
      scoundrel. I was everything monstrous. But your beauty made me crazy. You
      are right. I was a brute in leaving you as I did. But what could I do? I
      was married, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your wife still lives?&rdquo; asked Laura, bending a little forward in her
      eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel noticed the action, and he almost said &ldquo;no,&rdquo; but he thought of
      the folly of attempting concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What little color had wandered back into Laura&rsquo;s face forsook it again.
      Her heart stood still, her strength seemed going from her limbs. Her last
      hope was gone. The room swam before her for a moment, and the Colonel
      stepped towards her, but she waved him back, as hot anger again coursed
      through her veins, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you dare come with her, here, and tell me of it, here and mock me
      with it! And you think I will have it; George? You think I will let you
      live with that woman? You think I am as powerless as that day I fell dead
      at your feet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raged now. She was in a tempest of excitement. And she advanced
      towards him with a threatening mien. She would kill me if she could,
      thought the Colonel; but he thought at the same moment, how beautiful she
      is. He had recovered his head now. She was lovely when he knew her, then a
      simple country girl. Now she was dazzling, in the fullness of ripe
      womanhood, a superb creature, with all the fascination that a woman of the
      world has for such a man as Col. Selby. Nothing of this was lost on him.
      He stepped quickly to her, grasped both her hands in his, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura, stop! think! Suppose I loved you yet! Suppose I hated my fate!
      What can I do? I am broken by the war. I have lost everything almost. I
      had as lief be dead and done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel spoke with a low remembered voice that thrilled through Laura.
      He was looking into her eyes as he had looked in those old days, when no
      birds of all those that sang in the groves where they walked sang a note
      of warning. He was wounded. He had been punished. Her strength forsook her
      with her rage, and she sank upon a chair, sobbing,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my God, I thought I hated him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel knelt beside her. He took her hand and she let him keep it.
      She looked down into his face, with a pitiable tenderness, and said in a
      weak voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you do love me a little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel vowed and protested. He kissed her hand and her lips. He swore
      his false soul into perdition.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      She wanted love, this woman. Was not her love for George Selby deeper than
      any other woman&rsquo;s could be? Had she not a right to him? Did he not belong
      to her by virtue of her overmastering passion? His wife&mdash;she was not
      his wife, except by the law. She could not be. Even with the law she could
      have no right to stand between two souls that were one. It was an infamous
      condition in society that George should be tied to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura thought this, believed it; because she desired to believe it. She
      came to it as an original proposition founded on the requirements of her
      own nature. She may have heard, doubtless she had, similar theories that
      were prevalent at that day, theories of the tyranny of marriage and of the
      freedom of marriage. She had even heard women lecturers say, that marriage
      should only continue so long as it pleased either party to it&mdash;for a
      year, or a month, or a day. She had not given much heed to this, but she
      saw its justice now in a dash of revealing desire. It must be right. God
      would not have permitted her to love George Selby as she did, and him to
      love her, if it was right for society to raise up a barrier between them.
      He belonged to her. Had he not confessed it himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even the religious atmosphere of Senator Dilworthy&rsquo;s house had been
      sufficient to instill into Laura that deep Christian principle which had
      been somehow omitted in her training. Indeed in that very house had she
      not heard women, prominent before the country and besieging Congress,
      utter sentiments that fully justified the course she was marking out for
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were seated now, side by side, talking with more calmness. Laura was
      happy, or thought she was. But it was that feverish sort of happiness
      which is snatched out of the black shadow of falsehood, and is at the
      moment recognized as fleeting and perilous, and indulged tremblingly. She
      loved. She was loved. That is happiness certainly. And the black past and
      the troubled present and the uncertain future could not snatch that from
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did they say as they sat there? What nothings do people usually say
      in such circumstances, even if they are three-score and ten? It was enough
      for Laura to hear his voice and be near him. It was enough for him to be
      near her, and avoid committing himself as much as he could. Enough for him
      was the present also. Had there not always been some way out of such
      scrapes?
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet Laura could not be quite content without prying into tomorrow. How
      could the Colonel manage to free himself from his wife? Would it be long?
      Could he not go into some State where it would not take much time? He
      could not say exactly. That they must think of. That they must talk over.
      And so on. Did this seem like a damnable plot to Laura against the life,
      maybe, of a sister, a woman like herself? Probably not. It was right that
      this man should be hers, and there were some obstacles in the way. That
      was all. There are as good reasons for bad actions as for good ones,&mdash;to
      those who commit them. When one has broken the tenth commandment, the
      others are not of much account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it unnatural, therefore, that when George Selby departed, Laura should
      watch him from the window, with an almost joyful heart as he went down the
      sunny square? &ldquo;I shall see him to-morrow,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and the next day,
      and the next. He is mine now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the woman,&rdquo; said the Colonel as he picked his way down the steps.
      &ldquo;Or,&rdquo; he added, as his thoughts took a new turn, &ldquo;I wish my wife was in
      New Orleans.&rdquo;

    <p>
      As may be readily believed, Col. Beriah Sellers was by this time one of
      the best known men in Washington. For the first time in his life his
      talents had a fair field.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now at the centre of the manufacture of gigantic schemes, of
      speculations of all sorts, of political and social gossip. The atmosphere
      was full of little and big rumors and of vast, undefined expectations.
      Everybody was in haste, too, to push on his private plan, and feverish in
      his haste, as if in constant apprehension that tomorrow would be Judgment
      Day. Work while Congress is in session, said the uneasy spirit, for in the
      recess there is no work and no device.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel enjoyed this bustle and confusion amazingly; he thrived in the
      air of indefinite expectation. All his own schemes took larger shape and
      more misty and majestic proportions; and in this congenial air, the
      Colonel seemed even to himself to expand into something large and
      mysterious. If he respected himself before, he almost worshipped Beriah
      Sellers now, as a superior being. If he could have chosen an official
      position out of the highest, he would have been embarrassed in the
      selection. The presidency of the republic seemed too limited and cramped
      in the constitutional restrictions. If he could have been Grand Llama of
      the United States, that might have come the nearest to his idea of a
      position. And next to that he would have luxuriated in the irresponsible
      omniscience of the Special Correspondent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Sellers knew the President very well, and had access to his presence
      when officials were kept cooling their heels in the Waiting-room. The
      President liked to hear the Colonel talk, his voluble ease was a
      refreshment after the decorous dullness of men who only talked business
      and government, and everlastingly expounded their notions of justice and
      the distribution of patronage. The Colonel was as much a lover of farming
      and of horses as Thomas Jefferson was. He talked to the President by the
      hour about his magnificent stud, and his plantation at Hawkeye, a kind of
      principality&mdash;he represented it. He urged the President to pay him a
      visit during the recess, and see his stock farm.
    </p>

    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The President&rsquo;s table is well enough,&rdquo; he used to say, to the loafers who
      gathered about him at Willard&rsquo;s, &ldquo;well enough for a man on a salary, but
      God bless my soul, I should like him to see a little old-fashioned
      hospitality&mdash;open house, you know. A person seeing me at home might
      think I paid no attention to what was in the house, just let things flow
      in and out. He&rsquo;d be mistaken. What I look to is quality, sir. The
      President has variety enough, but the quality! Vegetables of course you
      can&rsquo;t expect here. I&rsquo;m very particular about mine. Take celery, now&mdash;there&rsquo;s
      only one spot in this country where celery will grow. But I am surprised
      about the wines. I should think they were manufactured in the New York
      Custom House. I must send the President some from my cellar. I was really
      mortified the other day at dinner to see Blacque Bey leave his standing in
      the glasses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Colonel first came to Washington he had thoughts of taking the
      mission to Constantinople, in order to be on the spot to look after the
      dissemination of his Eye Water, but as that invention; was not yet quite
      ready, the project shrank a little in the presence of vaster schemes.
      Besides he felt that he could do the country more good by remaining at
      home. He was one of the Southerners who were constantly quoted as heartily
      &ldquo;accepting the situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m whipped,&rdquo; he used to say with a jolly laugh, &ldquo;the government was too
      many for me; I&rsquo;m cleaned out, done for, except my plantation and private
      mansion. We played for a big thing, and lost it, and I don&rsquo;t whine, for
      one. I go for putting the old flag on all the vacant lots. I said to the
      President, says I, &lsquo;Grant, why don&rsquo;t you take Santo Domingo, annex the
      whole thing, and settle the bill afterwards. That&rsquo;s my way. I&rsquo;d take the
      job to manage Congress. The South would come into it. You&rsquo;ve got to
      conciliate the South, consolidate the two debts, pay &lsquo;em off in
      greenbacks, and go ahead. That&rsquo;s my notion. Boutwell&rsquo;s got the right
      notion about the value of paper, but he lacks courage. I should like to
      run the treasury department about six months. I&rsquo;d make things plenty, and
      business look up.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel had access to the departments. He knew all the senators and
      representatives, and especially, the lobby. He was consequently a great
      favorite in Newspaper Row, and was often lounging in the offices there,
      dropping bits of private, official information, which were immediately,
      caught up and telegraphed all over the country. But it used to surprise
      even the Colonel when he read it, it was embellished to that degree that
      he hardly recognized it, and the hint was not lost on him. He began to
      exaggerate his heretofore simple conversation to suit the newspaper
      demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      People used to wonder in the winters of 187- and 187-, where the
      &ldquo;Specials&rdquo; got that remarkable information with which they every morning
      surprised the country, revealing the most secret intentions of the
      President and his cabinet, the private thoughts of political leaders, the
      hidden meaning of every movement. This information was furnished by Col.
      Sellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was asked, afterwards, about the stolen copy of the Alabama Treaty
      which got into the &ldquo;New York Tribune,&rdquo; he only looked mysterious, and said
      that neither he nor Senator Dilworthy knew anything about it. But those
      whom he was in the habit of meeting occasionally felt almost certain that
      he did know.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed that the Colonel in his general patriotic labors
      neglected his own affairs. The Columbus River Navigation Scheme absorbed
      only a part of his time, so he was enabled to throw quite a strong reserve
      force of energy into the Tennessee Land plan, a vast enterprise
      commensurate with his abilities, and in the prosecution of which he was
      greatly aided by Mr. Henry Brierly, who was buzzing about the capitol and
      the hotels day and night, and making capital for it in some mysterious
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must create a public opinion,&rdquo; said Senator Dilworthy. &ldquo;My only
      interest in it is a public one, and if the country wants the institution,
      Congress will have to yield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may have been after a conversation between the Colonel and Senator
      Dilworthy that the following special despatch was sent to a New York
      newspaper:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We understand that a philanthropic plan is on foot in relation to the
        colored race that will, if successful, revolutionize the whole character
        of southern industry. An experimental institution is in contemplation in
        Tennessee which will do for that state what the Industrial School at
        Zurich did for Switzerland. We learn that approaches have been made to
        the heirs of the late Hon. Silas Hawkins of Missouri, in reference to a
        lease of a portion of their valuable property in East Tennessee. Senator
        Dilworthy, it is understood, is inflexibly opposed to any arrangement
        that will not give the government absolute control. Private interests
        must give way to the public good. It is to be hoped that Col. Sellers,
        who represents the heirs, will be led to see the matter in this light.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When Washington Hawkins read this despatch, he went to the Colonel in some
      anxiety. He was for a lease, he didn&rsquo;t want to surrender anything. What
      did he think the government would offer? Two millions?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May be three, may be four,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s worth more than the
      bank of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they will not lease,&rdquo; said Washington, &ldquo;let &lsquo;em make it two millions
      for an undivided half. I&rsquo;m not going to throw it away, not the whole of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry told the Colonel that they must drive the thing through, he couldn&rsquo;t
      be dallying round Washington when Spring opened. Phil wanted him, Phil had
      a great thing on hand up in Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; inquired the Colonel, always ready to interest himself in
      anything large.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A mountain of coal; that&rsquo;s all. He&rsquo;s going to run a tunnel into it in the
      Spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he want any capital?&rdquo;, asked the Colonel, in the tone of a man who
      is given to calculating carefully before he makes an investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Old man Bolton&rsquo;s behind him. He has capital, but I judged that he
      wanted my experience in starting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he wants me, tell him I&rsquo;ll come, after Congress adjourns. I should
      like to give him a little lift. He lacks enterprise&mdash;now, about that
      Columbus River. He doesn&rsquo;t see his chances. But he&rsquo;s a good fellow, and
      you can tell him that Sellers won&rsquo;t go back on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; asked Harry, &ldquo;who is that rather handsome party that&rsquo;s
      hanging &lsquo;round Laura? I see him with her everywhere, at the Capitol, in
      the horse cars, and he comes to Dilworthy&rsquo;s. If he weren&rsquo;t lame, I should
      think he was going to run off with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing. Laura knows her business. He has a cotton claim. Used
      to be at Hawkeye during the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Selby&rsquo;s his name, was a Colonel. Got a wife and family. Very respectable
      people, the Selby&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s business. But if a woman
      looked at me as I&rsquo;ve seen her at Selby, I should understand it. And it&rsquo;s
      talked about, I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jealousy had no doubt sharpened this young gentleman&rsquo;s observation. Laura
      could not have treated him with more lofty condescension if she had been
      the Queen of Sheba, on a royal visit to the great republic. And he
      resented it, and was &ldquo;huffy&rdquo; when he was with her, and ran her errands,
      and brought her gossip, and bragged of his intimacy with the lovely
      creature among the fellows at Newspaper Row.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s life was rushing on now in the full stream of intrigue and
      fashionable dissipation. She was conspicuous at the balls of the fastest
      set, and was suspected of being present at those doubtful suppers that
      began late and ended early. If Senator Dilworthy remonstrated about
      appearances, she had a way of silencing him. Perhaps she had some hold on
      him, perhaps she was necessary to his plan for ameliorating the condition
      of the colored race.

      She saw Col. Selby, when the public knew and when it did not know. She
      would see him, whatever excuses he made, and however he avoided her. She
      was urged on by a fever of love and hatred and jealousy, which alternately
      possessed her. Sometimes she petted him, and coaxed him and tried all her
      fascinations. And again she threatened him and reproached him. What was he
      doing? Why had he taken no steps to free himself? Why didn&rsquo;t he send his
      wife home? She should have money soon. They could go to Europe&mdash;anywhere.
      What did she care for talk?
    </p>
    <p>
      And he promised, and lied, and invented fresh excuses for delay, like a
      cowardly gambler and roue as he was, fearing to break with her, and half
      the time unwilling to give her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That woman doesn&rsquo;t know what fear is,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;and she
      watches me like a hawk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told his wife that this woman was a lobbyist, whom he had to tolerate
      and use in getting through his claims, and that he should pay her and have
      done with her, when he succeeded.

      Henry Brierly was at the Dilworthy&rsquo;s constantly and on such terms of
      intimacy that he came and went without question. The Senator was not an
      inhospitable man, he liked to have guests in his house, and Harry&rsquo;s gay
      humor and rattling way entertained him; for even the most devout men and
      busy statesmen must have hours of relaxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry himself believed that he was of great service in the University
      business, and that the success of the scheme depended upon him to a great
      degree. He spent many hours in talking it over with the Senator after
      dinner. He went so far as to consider whether it would be worth his while
      to take the professorship of civil engineering in the new institution.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not the Senator&rsquo;s society nor his dinners&mdash;at which this
      scapegrace remarked that there was too much grace and too little wine&mdash;which
      attracted him to the house. The fact was the poor fellow hung around there
      day after day for the chance of seeing Laura for five minutes at a time.
      For her presence at dinner he would endure the long bore of the Senator&rsquo;s
      talk afterwards, while Laura was off at some assembly, or excused herself
      on the plea of fatigue. Now and then he accompanied her to some reception,
      and rarely, on off nights, he was blessed with her company in the parlor,
      when he sang, and was chatty and vivacious and performed a hundred little
      tricks of imitation and ventriloquism, and made himself as entertaining as
      a man could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      It puzzled him not a little that all his fascinations seemed to go for so
      little with Laura; it was beyond his experience with women. Sometimes
      Laura was exceedingly kind and petted him a little, and took the trouble
      to exert her powers of pleasing, and to entangle him deeper and deeper.
      But this, it angered him afterwards to think, was in private; in public
      she was beyond his reach, and never gave occasion to the suspicion that
      she had any affair with him. He was never permitted to achieve the dignity
      of a serious flirtation with her in public.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you treat me so?&rdquo; he once said, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Treat you how?&rdquo; asked Laura in a sweet voice, lifting her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well enough. You let other fellows monopolize you in society,
      and you are as indifferent to me as if we were strangers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I help it if they are attentive, can I be rude? But we are such old
      friends, Mr. Brierly, that I didn&rsquo;t suppose you would be jealous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I must be a very old friend, then, by your conduct towards me. By
      the same rule I should judge that Col. Selby must be very new.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura looked up quickly, as if about to return an indignant answer to such
      impertinence, but she only said, &ldquo;Well, what of Col. Selby, sauce-box?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, probably, you&rsquo;ll care for. Your being with him so much is the
      town talk, that&rsquo;s all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do people say?&rdquo; asked Laura calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they say a good many things. You are offended, though, to have me
      speak of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. You are my true friend. I feel that I can trust you.
      You wouldn&rsquo;t deceive me, Harry?&rdquo; throwing into her eyes a look of trust
      and tenderness that melted away all his petulance and distrust. &ldquo;What do
      they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some say that you&rsquo;ve lost your head about him; others that you don&rsquo;t care
      any more for him than you do for a dozen others, but that he is completely
      fascinated with you and about to desert his wife; and others say it is
      nonsense to suppose you would entangle yourself with a married man, and
      that your intimacy only arises from the matter of the cotton, claims, for
      which he wants your influence with Dilworthy. But you know everybody is
      talked about more or less in Washington. I shouldn&rsquo;t care; but I wish you
      wouldn&rsquo;t have so much to do with Selby, Laura,&rdquo; continued Harry, fancying
      that he was now upon such terms that his, advice, would be heeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you believed these slanders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe anything against you, Laura, but Col. Selby does not mean
      you any good. I know you wouldn&rsquo;t be seen with him if you knew his
      reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know him?&rdquo; Laura asked, as indifferently as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a little. I was at his lodgings&rsquo; in Georgetown a day or two ago,
      with Col. Sellers. Sellers wanted to talk with him about some patent
      remedy he has, Eye Water, or something of that sort, which he wants to
      introduce into Europe. Selby is going abroad very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura started; in spite of her self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And his wife!&mdash;Does he take his family? Did you see his wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. A dark little woman, rather worn&mdash;must have been pretty once
      though. Has three or four children, one of them a baby. They&rsquo;ll all go of
      course. She said she should be glad enough to get away from Washington.
      You know Selby has got his claim allowed, and they say he has had a run of
      luck lately at Morrissey&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura heard all this in a kind of stupor, looking straight at Harry,
      without seeing him. Is it possible, she was thinking, that this base
      wretch, after all his promises, will take his wife and children and leave
      me? Is it possible the town is saying all these things about me? And a
      look of bitterness coming into her face&mdash;does the fool think he can
      escape so?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are angry with me, Laura,&rdquo; said Harry, not comprehending in the least
      what was going on in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Angry?&rdquo; she said, forcing herself to come back to his presence. &ldquo;With
      you? Oh no. I&rsquo;m angry with the cruel world, which, pursues an independent
      woman as it never does a man. I&rsquo;m grateful to you Harry; I&rsquo;m grateful to
      you for telling me of that odious man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she rose from her chair and gave him her pretty hand, which the silly
      fellow took, and kissed and clung to. And he said many silly things,
      before she disengaged herself gently, and left him, saying it was time to
      dress, for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Harry went away, excited, and a little hopeful, but only a little. The
      happiness was only a gleam, which departed and left him thoroughly
      miserable. She never would love him, and she was going to the devil,
      besides. He couldn&rsquo;t shut his eyes to what he saw, nor his ears to what he
      heard of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      What had come over this thrilling young lady-killer? It was a pity to see
      such a gay butterfly broken on a wheel. Was there something good in him,
      after all, that had been touched? He was in fact madly in love with this
      woman.

      It is not for us to analyze the passion and say whether it was a worthy
      one. It absorbed his whole nature and made him wretched enough. If he
      deserved punishment, what more would you have? Perhaps this love was
      kindling a new heroism in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the road on which Laura was going clearly enough, though he did not
      believe the worst he heard of her. He loved her too passionately to credit
      that for a moment. And it seemed to him that if he could compel her to
      recognize her position, and his own devotion, she might love him, and that
      he could save her. His love was so far ennobled, and become a very
      different thing from its beginning in Hawkeye. Whether he ever thought
      that if he could save her from ruin, he could give her up himself, is
      doubtful. Such a pitch of virtue does not occur often in real life,
      especially in such natures as Harry&rsquo;s, whose generosity and unselfishness
      were matters of temperament rather than habits or principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote a long letter to Laura, an incoherent, passionate letter, pouring
      out his love as he could not do in her presence, and warning her as
      plainly as he dared of the dangers that surrounded her, and the risks she
      ran of compromising herself in many ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura read the letter, with a little sigh may be, as she thought of other
      days, but with contempt also, and she put it into the fire with the
      thought, &ldquo;They are all alike.&rdquo;

      Harry was in the habit of writing to Philip freely, and boasting also
      about his doings, as he could not help doing and remain himself. Mixed up
      with his own exploits, and his daily triumphs as a lobbyist, especially in
      the matter of the new University, in which Harry was to have something
      handsome, were amusing sketches of Washington society, hints about
      Dilworthy, stories about Col. Sellers, who had become a well-known
      character, and wise remarks upon the machinery of private legislation for
      the public-good, which greatly entertained Philip in his convalescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s name occurred very often in these letters, at first in casual
      mention as the belle of the season, carrying everything before her with
      her wit and beauty, and then more seriously, as if Harry did not exactly
      like so much general admiration of her, and was a little nettled by her
      treatment of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was so different from Harry&rsquo;s usual tone about women, that Philip
      wondered a good deal over it. Could it be possible that he was seriously
      affected? Then came stories about Laura, town talk, gossip which Harry
      denied the truth of indignantly; but he was evidently uneasy, and at
      length wrote in such miserable spirits that Philip asked him squarely what
      the trouble was; was he in love?
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this, Harry made a clean breast of it, and told Philip all he knew
      about the Selby affair, and Laura&rsquo;s treatment of him, sometimes
      encouraging him&mdash;and then throwing him off, and finally his belief
      that she would go to the bad if something was not done to arouse her from
      her infatuation. He wished Philip was in Washington. He knew Laura, and
      she had a great respect for his character, his opinions, his judgment.
      Perhaps he, as an uninterested person in whom she would have some
      confidence, and as one of the public, could say some thing to her that
      would show her where she stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip saw the situation clearly enough. Of Laura he knew not much, except
      that she was a woman of uncommon fascination, and he thought from what he
      had seen of her in Hawkeye, her conduct towards him and towards Harry, of
      not too much principle. Of course he knew nothing of her history; he knew
      nothing seriously against her, and if Harry was desperately enamored of
      her, why should he not win her if he could. If, however, she had already
      become what Harry uneasily felt she might become, was it not his duty to
      go to the rescue of his friend and try to save him from any rash act on
      account of a woman that might prove to be entirely unworthy of him; for
      trifler and visionary as he was, Harry deserved a better fate than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip determined to go to Washington and see for himself. He had other
      reasons also. He began to know enough of Mr. Bolton&rsquo;s affairs to be
      uneasy. Pennybacker had been there several times during the winter, and he
      suspected that he was involving Mr. Bolton in some doubtful scheme.
      Pennybacker was in Washington, and Philip thought he might perhaps find
      out something about him, and his plans, that would be of service to Mr.
      Bolton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had enjoyed his winter very well, for a man with his arm broken and
      his head smashed. With two such nurses as Ruth and Alice, illness seemed
      to him rather a nice holiday, and every moment of his convalescence had
      been precious and all too fleeting. With a young fellow of the habits of
      Philip, such injuries cannot be counted on to tarry long, even for the
      purpose of love-making, and Philip found himself getting strong with even
      disagreeable rapidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his first weeks of pain and weakness, Ruth was unceasing in her
      ministrations; she quietly took charge of him, and with a gentle firmness
      resisted all attempts of Alice or any one else to share to any great
      extent the burden with her. She was clear, decisive and peremptory in
      whatever she did; but often when Philip opened his eyes in those first
      days of suffering and found her standing by his bedside, he saw a look of
      tenderness in her anxious face that quickened his already feverish pulse,
      a look that remained in his heart long after he closed his eyes. Sometimes
      he felt her hand on his forehead, and did not open his eyes for fear she
      would take it away. He watched for her coming to his chamber; he could
      distinguish her light footstep from all others. If this is what is meant
      by women practicing medicine, thought Philip to himself, I like it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; said he one day when he was getting to be quite himself, &ldquo;I
      believe in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe in what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, in women physicians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;d better call in Mrs. Dr. Longstreet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. One will do, one at a time. I think I should be well tomorrow, if
      I thought I should never have any other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy physician thinks thee mustn&rsquo;t talk, Philip,&rdquo; said Ruth putting her
      finger on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Ruth, I want to tell you that I should wish I never had got well if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p370" id="p370"></a>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there, thee must not talk. Thee is wandering again,&rdquo; and Ruth
      closed his lips, with a smile on her own that broadened into a merry laugh
      as she ran away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was not weary, however, of making these attempts, he rather enjoyed
      it. But whenever he inclined to be sentimental, Ruth would cut him off,
      with some such gravely conceived speech as, &ldquo;Does thee think that thy
      physician will take advantage of the condition of a man who is as weak as
      thee is? I will call Alice, if thee has any dying confessions to make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Philip convalesced, Alice more and more took Ruth&rsquo;s place as his
      entertainer, and read to him by the hour, when he did not want to talk&mdash;to
      talk about Ruth, as he did a good deal of the time. Nor was this
      altogether unsatisfactory to Philip. He was always happy and contented
      with Alice. She was the most restful person he knew. Better informed than
      Ruth and with a much more varied culture, and bright and sympathetic, he
      was never weary of her company, if he was not greatly excited by it. She
      had upon his mind that peaceful influence that Mrs. Bolton had when,
      occasionally, she sat by his bedside with her work. Some people have this
      influence, which is like an emanation. They bring peace to a house, they
      diffuse serene content in a room full of mixed company, though they may
      say very little, and are apparently unconscious of their own power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that Philip did not long for Ruth&rsquo;s presence all the same. Since he
      was well enough to be about the house, she was busy again with her
      studies. Now and then her teasing humor came again. She always had a
      playful shield against his sentiment. Philip used sometimes to declare
      that she had no sentiment; and then he doubted if he should be pleased
      with her after all if she were at all sentimental; and he rejoiced that
      she had, in such matters what he called the airy grace of sanity. She was
      the most gay serious person he ever saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he was not so much at rest or so contented with her as with Alice.
      But then he loved her. And what have rest and contentment to do with love?

    <p>
      Mr. Buckstone&rsquo;s campaign was brief&mdash;much briefer than he supposed it
      would be. He began it purposing to win Laura without being won himself;
      but his experience was that of all who had fought on that field before
      him; he diligently continued his effort to win her, but he presently found
      that while as yet he could not feel entirely certain of having won her, it
      was very manifest that she had won him. He had made an able fight, brief
      as it was, and that at least was to his credit. He was in good company,
      now; he walked in a leash of conspicuous captives. These unfortunates
      followed Laura helplessly, for whenever she took a prisoner he remained
      her slave henceforth. Sometimes they chafed in their bondage; sometimes
      they tore themselves free and said their serfdom was ended; but sooner or
      later they always came back penitent and worshiping. Laura pursued her
      usual course: she encouraged Mr. Buckstone by turns, and by turns she
      harassed him; she exalted him to the clouds at one time, and at another
      she dragged him down again. She constituted him chief champion of the
      Knobs University bill, and he accepted the position, at first reluctantly,
      but later as a valued means of serving her&mdash;he even came to look upon
      it as a piece of great good fortune, since it brought him into such
      frequent contact with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through him she learned that the Hon. Mr. Trollop was a bitter enemy of
      her bill. He urged her not to attempt to influence Mr. Trollop in any way,
      and explained that whatever she might attempt in that direction would
      surely be used against her and with damaging effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      She at first said she knew Mr. Trollop, &ldquo;and was aware that he had a
      Blank-Blank;&rdquo;&mdash;[**Her private figure of speech for Brother&mdash;or
      Son-in-law]&mdash;but Mr. Buckstone said that he was not able to conceive
      what so curious a phrase as Blank-Blank might mean, and had no wish to pry
      into the matter, since it was probably private, he &ldquo;would nevertheless
      venture the blind assertion that nothing would answer in this particular
      case and during this particular session but to be exceedingly wary and
      keep clear away from Mr. Trollop; any other course would be fatal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed that nothing could be done. Laura was seriously troubled.
      Everything was looking well, and yet it was plain that one vigorous and
      determined enemy might eventually succeed in overthrowing all her plans. A
      suggestion came into her mind presently and she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you fight against his great Pension bill and bring him to terms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never; he and I are sworn brothers on that measure; we work in
      harness and are very loving&mdash;I do everything I possibly can for him
      there. But I work with might and main against his Immigration bill,&mdash;as
      pertinaciously and as vindictively, indeed, as he works against our
      University. We hate each other through half a conversation and are all
      affection through the other half. We understand each other. He is an
      admirable worker outside the capitol; he will do more for the Pension bill
      than any other man could do; I wish he would make the great speech on it
      which he wants to make&mdash;and then I would make another and we would be
      safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well if he wants to make a great speech why doesn&rsquo;t he do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Visitors interrupted the conversation and Mr. Buckstone took his leave. It
      was not of the least moment to Laura that her question had not been
      answered, inasmuch as it concerned a thing which did not interest her; and
      yet, human being like, she thought she would have liked to know. An
      opportunity occurring presently, she put the same question to another
      person and got an answer that satisfied her. She pondered a good while
      that night, after she had gone to bed, and when she finally turned over to
      go to sleep, she had thought out a new scheme. The next evening at Mrs.
      Gloverson&rsquo;s party, she said to Mr. Buckstone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want Mr. Trollop to make his great speech on the Pension bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you? But you remember I was interrupted, and did not explain to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, I know. You must make him make that speech. I very
      particularly desire it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is easy to say make him do it, but how am I to make him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is perfectly easy; I have thought it all out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then went into the details. At length Mr. Buckstone said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see now. I can manage it, I am sure. Indeed I wonder he never thought
      of it himself&mdash;there are no end of precedents. But how is this going
      to benefit you, after I have managed it? There is where the mystery lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will take care of that. It will benefit me a great deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish I could see how; it is the oddest freak. You seem to go the
      furthest around to get at a thing&mdash;but you are in earnest, aren&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I am, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will do it&mdash;but why not tell me how you imagine it is
      going to help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, by and by.&mdash;Now there is nobody talking to him. Go straight
      and do it, there&rsquo;s a good fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment or two later the two sworn friends of the Pension bill were
      talking together, earnestly, and seemingly unconscious of the moving
      throng about them. They talked an hour, and then Mr. Buckstone came back
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p375" id="p375"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p375.jpg (44K)" src="images/p375.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hardly fancied it at first, but he fell in love with it after a bit.
      And we have made a compact, too. I am to keep his secret and he is to
      spare me, in future, when he gets ready to denounce the supporters of the
      University bill&mdash;and I can easily believe he will keep his word on
      this occasion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight elapsed, and the University bill had gathered to itself many
      friends, meantime. Senator Dilworthy began to think the harvest was ripe.
      He conferred with Laura privately. She was able to tell him exactly how
      the House would vote. There was a majority&mdash;the bill would pass,
      unless weak members got frightened at the last, and deserted&mdash;a thing
      pretty likely to occur. The Senator said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we had one more good strong man. Now Trollop ought to be on our
      side, for he is a friend of the negro. But he is against us, and is our
      bitterest opponent. If he would simply vote No, but keep quiet and not
      molest us, I would feel perfectly cheerful and content. But perhaps there
      is no use in thinking of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I laid a little plan for his benefit two weeks ago. I think he will
      be tractable, maybe. He is to come here tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for him, my child! He means mischief, sure. It is said that he
      claims to know of improper practices having been used in the interest of
      this bill, and he thinks he sees a chance to make a great sensation when
      the bill comes up. Be wary. Be very, very careful, my dear. Do your very
      ablest talking, now. You can convince a man of anything, when you try. You
      must convince him that if anything improper has been done, you at least
      are ignorant of it and sorry for it. And if you could only persuade him
      out of his hostility to the bill, too&mdash;but don&rsquo;t overdo the thing;
      don&rsquo;t seem too anxious, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;ll be ever so careful. I&rsquo;ll talk as sweetly to him as if he
      were my own child! You may trust me&mdash;indeed you may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door-bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the gentleman now,&rdquo; said Laura. Senator Dilworthy retired to his
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura welcomed Mr. Trollop, a grave, carefully dressed and very
      respectable looking man, with a bald head, standing collar and old
      fashioned watch seals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promptness is a virtue, Mr. Trollop, and I perceive that you have it. You
      are always prompt with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always meet my engagements, of every kind, Miss Hawkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a quality which is rarer in the world than it has been, I believe.
      I wished to see you on business, Mr. Trollop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I judged so. What can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know my bill&mdash;the Knobs University bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I believe it is your bill. I had forgotten. Yes, I know the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, would you mind telling me your opinion of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, since you seem to ask it without reserve, I am obliged to say
      that I do not regard it favorably. I have not seen the bill itself, but
      from what I can hear, it&mdash;it&mdash;well, it has a bad look about it.
      It&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak it out&mdash;never fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&mdash;they say it contemplates a fraud upon the government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Laura tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I say &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose it were a fraud&mdash;which I feel able to deny&mdash;would
      it be the first one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take a body&rsquo;s breath away! Would you&mdash;did you wish me to vote
      for it? Was that what you wanted to see me about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your instinct is correct. I did want you&mdash;I do want you to vote for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vote for a fr&mdash;for a measure which is generally believed to be at
      least questionable? I am afraid we cannot come to an understanding, Miss
      Hawkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am afraid not&mdash;if you have resumed your principles, Mr.
      Trollop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you send for me merely to insult me? It is time for me to take my
      leave, Miss Hawkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;wait a moment. Don&rsquo;t be offended at a trifle. Do not be offish
      and unsociable. The Steamship Subsidy bill was a fraud on the government.
      You voted for it, Mr. Trollop, though you always opposed the measure until
      after you had an interview one evening with a certain Mrs. McCarter at her
      house. She was my agent. She was acting for me. Ah, that is right&mdash;sit
      down again. You can be sociable, easily enough if you have a mind to.
      Well? I am waiting. Have you nothing to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hawkins, I voted for that bill because when I came to examine into
      it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes. When you came to examine into it. Well, I only want you to
      examine into my bill. Mr. Trollop, you would not sell your vote on that
      subsidy bill&mdash;which was perfectly right&mdash;but you accepted of
      some of the stock, with the understanding that it was to stand in your
      brother-in-law&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no pr&mdash;I mean, this is, utterly groundless, Miss Hawkins.&rdquo;
       But the gentleman seemed somewhat uneasy, nevertheless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not entirely so, perhaps. I and a person whom we will call Miss
      Blank (never mind the real name,) were in a closet at your elbow all the
      while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trollop winced&mdash;then he said with dignity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hawkins is it possible that you were capable of such a thing as
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was bad; I confess that. It was bad. Almost as bad as selling one&rsquo;s
      vote for&mdash;but I forget; you did not sell your vote&mdash;you only
      accepted a little trifle, a small token of esteem, for your
      brother-in-law. Oh, let us come out and be frank with each other: I know
      you, Mr. Trollop. I have met you on business three or four times; true, I
      never offered to corrupt your principles&mdash;never hinted such a thing;
      but always when I had finished sounding you, I manipulated you through an
      agent. Let us be frank. Wear this comely disguise of virtue before the
      public&mdash;it will count there; but here it is out of place. My dear
      sir, by and by there is going to be an investigation into that National
      Internal Improvement Directors&rsquo; Relief Measure of a few years ago, and you
      know very well that you will be a crippled man, as likely as not, when it
      is completed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be shown that a man is a knave merely for owning that stock. I
      am not distressed about the National Improvement Relief Measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh indeed I am not trying to distress you. I only wished to make good my
      assertion that I knew you. Several of you gentlemen bought of that stack
      (without paying a penny down) received dividends from it, (think of the
      happy idea of receiving dividends, and very large ones, too, from stock
      one hasn&rsquo;t paid for!) and all the while your names never appeared in the
      transaction; if ever you took the stock at all, you took it in other
      people&rsquo;s names. Now you see, you had to know one of two things; namely,
      you either knew that the idea of all this preposterous generosity was to
      bribe you into future legislative friendship, or you didn&rsquo;t know it. That
      is to say, you had to be either a knave or a&mdash;well, a fool&mdash;there
      was no middle ground. You are not a fool, Mr. Trollop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hawking you flatter me. But seriously, you do not forget that some
      of the best and purest men in Congress took that stock in that way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Senator Blank?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no&mdash;I believe not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you believe not. Do you suppose he was ever approached, on the
      subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had approached him, for instance, fortified with the fact that
      some of the best men in Congress, and the purest, etc., etc.; what would
      have been the result?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what WOULD have been the result?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would have shown you the door! For Mr. Blank is neither a knave nor a
      fool. There are other men in the Senate and the House whom no one would
      have been hardy enough to approach with that Relief Stock in that
      peculiarly generous way, but they are not of the class that you regard as
      the best and purest. No, I say I know you Mr. Trollop. That is to say, one
      may suggest a thing to Mr. Trollop which it would not do to suggest to Mr.
      Blank. Mr. Trollop, you are pledged to support the Indigent Congressmen&rsquo;s
      Retroactive Appropriation which is to come up, either in this or the next
      session. You do not deny that, even in public. The man that will vote for
      that bill will break the eighth commandment in any other way, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he will not vote for your corrupt measure, nevertheless, madam!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Mr. Trollop, rising from his seat in a passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but he will. Sit down again, and let me explain why. Oh, come, don&rsquo;t
      behave so. It is very unpleasant. Now be good, and you shall have the
      missing page of your great speech. Here it is!&rdquo;&mdash;and she displayed a
      sheet of manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trollop turned immediately back from the threshold. It might have been
      gladness that flashed into his face; it might have been something else;
      but at any rate there was much astonishment mixed with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p380" id="p380"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p380.jpg (25K)" src="images/p380.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! Where did you get it? Give it me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now there is no hurry. Sit down; sit down and let us talk and be
      friendly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman wavered. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, this is only a subterfuge. I will go. It is not the missing page.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura tore off a couple of lines from the bottom of the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you will know whether this is the handwriting or not.
      You know it is the handwriting. Now if you will listen, you will know that
      this must be the list of statistics which was to be the &lsquo;nub&rsquo; of your
      great effort, and the accompanying blast the beginning of the burst of
      eloquence which was continued on the next page&mdash;and you will
      recognize that there was where you broke down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She read the page. Mr. Trollop said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is perfectly astounding. Still, what is all this to me? It is
      nothing. It does not concern me. The speech is made, and there an end. I
      did break down for a moment, and in a rather uncomfortable place, since I
      had led up to those statistics with some grandeur; the hiatus was
      pleasanter to the House and the galleries than it was to me. But it is no
      matter now. A week has passed; the jests about it ceased three or four
      days ago. The whole thing is a matter of indifference to me, Miss
      Hawkins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you apologized; and promised the statistics for next day. Why didn&rsquo;t
      you keep your promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The matter was not of sufficient consequence. The time was gone by to
      produce an effect with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I hear that other friends of the Soldiers&rsquo; Pension Bill desire them
      very much. I think you ought to let them have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hawkins, this silly blunder of my copyist evidently has more
      interest for you than it has for me. I will send my private secretary to
      you and let him discuss the subject with you at length.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he copy your speech for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he did. Why all these questions? Tell me&mdash;how did you get
      hold of that page of manuscript? That is the only thing that stirs a
      passing interest in my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that.&rdquo; Then she said, much as if she were talking to
      herself: &ldquo;It does seem like taking a deal of unnecessary pains, for a body
      to hire another body to construct a great speech for him and then go and
      get still another body to copy it before it can be read in the House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hawkins, what do you mean by such talk as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I am sure I mean no harm&mdash;no harm to anybody in the world. I am
      certain that I overheard the Hon. Mr. Buckstone either promise to write
      your great speech for you or else get some other competent person to do
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is perfectly absurd, madam, perfectly absurd!&rdquo; and Mr. Trollop
      affected a laugh of derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the thing has occurred before now. I mean that I have heard that
      Congressmen have sometimes hired literary grubs to build speeches for
      them.&mdash;Now didn&rsquo;t I overhear a conversation like that I spoke of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! Why of course you may have overheard some such jesting nonsense.
      But would one be in earnest about so farcical a thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well if it was only a joke, why did you make a serious matter of it? Why
      did you get the speech written for you, and then read it in the House
      without ever having it copied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trollop did not laugh this time; he seemed seriously perplexed. He
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, play out your jest, Miss Hawkins. I can&rsquo;t understand what you are
      contriving&mdash;but it seems to entertain you&mdash;so please, go on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, I assure you; but I hope to make the matter entertaining to you,
      too. Your private secretary never copied your speech.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? Really you seem to know my affairs better than I do myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I do. You can&rsquo;t name your own amanuensis, Mr. Trollop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is sad, indeed. Perhaps Miss Hawkins can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can. I wrote your speech myself, and you read it from my
      manuscript. There, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trollop did not spring to his feet and smite his brow with his hand
      while a cold sweat broke out all over him and the color forsook his face&mdash;no,
      he only said, &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; and looked greatly astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura handed him her commonplace-book and called his attention to the fact
      that the handwriting there and the handwriting of this speech were the
      same. He was shortly convinced. He laid the book aside and said,
      composedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the wonderful tragedy is done, and it transpires that I am indebted
      to you for my late eloquence. What of it? What was all this for and what
      does it amount to after all? What do you propose to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh nothing. It is only a bit of pleasantry. When I overheard that
      conversation I took an early opportunity to ask Mr. Buckstone if he knew
      of anybody who might want a speech written&mdash;I had a friend, and so
      forth and so on. I was the friend, myself; I thought I might do you a good
      turn then and depend on you to do me one by and by. I never let Mr.
      Buckstone have the speech till the last moment, and when you hurried off
      to the House with it, you did not know there was a missing page, of
      course, but I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now perhaps you think that if I refuse to support your bill, you will
      make a grand exposure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I had not thought of that. I only kept back the page for the mere
      fun of the thing; but since you mention it, I don&rsquo;t know but I might do
      something if I were angry.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;My dear Miss Hawkins, if you were to give out that you composed my
      speech, you know very well that people would say it was only your
      raillery, your fondness for putting a victim in the pillory and amusing
      the public at his expense. It is too flimsy, Miss Hawkins, for a person of
      your fine inventive talent&mdash;contrive an abler device than that.
      Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easily done, Mr. Trollop. I will hire a man, and pin this page on
      his breast, and label it, &lsquo;The Missing Fragment of the Hon. Mr. Trollop&rsquo;s
      Great Speech&mdash;which speech was written and composed by Miss Laura
      Hawkins under a secret understanding for one hundred dollars&mdash;and the
      money has not been paid.&rsquo; And I will pin round about it notes in my
      handwriting, which I will procure from prominent friends of mine for the
      occasion; also your printed speech in the Globe, showing the connection
      between its bracketed hiatus and my Fragment; and I give you my word of
      honor that I will stand that human bulletin board in the rotunda of the
      capitol and make him stay there a week! You see you are premature, Mr.
      Trollop, the wonderful tragedy is not done yet, by any means. Come, now,
      doesn&rsquo;t it improve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Mr Trollop opened his eyes rather widely at this novel aspect of the case.
      He got up and walked the floor and gave himself a moment for reflection.
      Then he stopped and studied Laura&rsquo;s face a while, and ended by saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am obliged to believe you would be reckless enough to do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t put me to the test, Mr. Trollop. But let&rsquo;s drop the matter. I
      have had my joke and you&rsquo;ve borne the infliction becomingly enough. It
      spoils a jest to harp on it after one has had one&rsquo;s laugh. I would much
      rather talk about my bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would I, now, my clandestine amanuensis. Compared with some other
      subjects, even your bill is a pleasant topic to discuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good indeed! I thought I could persuade you. Now I am sure you will
      be generous to the poor negro and vote for that bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I feel more tenderly toward the oppressed colored man than I did.
      Shall we bury the hatchet and be good friends and respect each other&rsquo;s
      little secrets, on condition that I vote Aye on the measure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart, Mr. Trollop. I give you my word of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a bargain. But isn&rsquo;t there something else you could give me, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura looked at him inquiringly a moment, and then she comprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! You may have it now. I haven&rsquo;t any more use for it.&rdquo; She picked
      up the page of manuscript, but she reconsidered her intention of handing
      it to him, and said, &ldquo;But never mind; I will keep it close; no one shall
      see it; you shall have it as soon as your vote is recorded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trollop looked disappointed. But presently made his adieux, and had
      got as far as the hall, when something occurred to Laura. She said to
      herself, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t simply want his vote under compulsion&mdash;he might
      vote aye, but work against the bill in secret, for revenge; that man is
      unscrupulous enough to do anything. I must have his hearty co-operation as
      well as his vote. There is only one way to get that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She called him back, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I value your vote, Mr. Trollop, but I value your influence more. You are
      able to help a measure along in many ways, if you choose. I want to ask
      you to work for the bill as well as vote for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It takes so much of one&rsquo;s time, Miss Hawkins&mdash;and time is money, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know it is&mdash;especially in Congress. Now there is no use in
      you and I dealing in pretenses and going at matters in round-about ways.
      We know each other&mdash;disguises are nonsense. Let us be plain. I will
      make it an object to you to work for the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it unnecessarily plain, please. There are little proprieties
      that are best preserved. What do you propose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this.&rdquo; She mentioned the names of several prominent Congressmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;these gentlemen are to vote and work for the bill,
      simply out of love for the negro&mdash;and out of pure generosity I have
      put in a relative of each as a member of the University incorporation.
      They will handle a million or so of money, officially, but will receive no
      salaries. A larger number of statesmen are to vote and work for the bill&mdash;also
      out of love for the negro&mdash;gentlemen of but moderate influence, these&mdash;and
      out of pure generosity I am to see that relatives of theirs have positions
      in the University, with salaries, and good ones, too. You will vote and
      work for the bill, from mere affection for the negro, and I desire to
      testify my gratitude becomingly. Make free choice. Have you any friend
      whom you would like to present with a salaried or unsalaried position in
      our institution?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have a brother-in-law&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That same old brother-in-law, you good unselfish provider! I have heard
      of him often, through my agents. How regularly he does &lsquo;turn up,&rsquo; to be
      sure. He could deal with those millions virtuously, and withal with
      ability, too&mdash;but of course you would rather he had a salaried
      position?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said the gentleman, facetiously, &ldquo;we are very humble, very
      humble in our desires; we want no money; we labor solely, for our country
      and require no reward but the luxury of an applauding conscience. Make him
      one of those poor hard working unsalaried corporators and let him do every
      body good with those millions&mdash;and go hungry himself! I will try to
      exert a little influence in favor of the bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at home, Mr. Trollop sat down and thought it all over&mdash;something
      after this fashion: it is about the shape it might have taken if he had
      spoken it aloud.

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My reputation is getting a little damaged, and I meant to clear it up
      brilliantly with an exposure of this bill at the supreme moment, and ride
      back into Congress on the eclat of it; and if I had that bit of
      manuscript, I would do it yet. It would be more money in my pocket in the
      end, than my brother-in-law will get out of that incorporatorship, fat as
      it is. But that sheet of paper is out of my reach&mdash;she will never let
      that get out of her hands. And what a mountain it is! It blocks up my
      road, completely. She was going to hand it to me, once. Why didn&rsquo;t she!
      Must be a deep woman. Deep devil! That is what she is; a beautiful devil&mdash;and
      perfectly fearless, too. The idea of her pinning that paper on a man and
      standing him up in the rotunda looks absurd at a first glance. But she
      would do it! She is capable of doing anything. I went there hoping she
      would try to bribe me&mdash;good solid capital that would be in the
      exposure. Well, my prayer was answered; she did try to bribe me; and I
      made the best of a bad bargain and let her. I am checkmated. I must
      contrive something fresh to get back to Congress on. Very well; a bird in
      the hand is worth two in the bush; I will work for the bill&mdash;the
      incorporatorship will be a very good thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Mr. Trollop had taken his leave, Laura ran to Senator Dilworthy
      and began to speak, but he interrupted her and said distressfully, without
      even turning from his writing to look at her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only half an hour! You gave it up early, child. However, it was best, it
      was best&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure it was best&mdash;and safest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it up! I!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator sprang up, all aglow:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child, you can&rsquo;t mean that you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made him promise on honor to think about a compromise tonight and
      come and tell me his decision in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! There&rsquo;s hope yet that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, uncle. I&rsquo;ve made him engage to let the Tennessee Land bill
      utterly alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible! You&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made him promise to vote with us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;INCREDIBLE! Abso&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made him swear that he&rsquo;ll work for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;PRE - - - POSTEROUS!&mdash;Utterly pre&mdash;break a window, child,
      before I suffocate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter, it&rsquo;s true anyway. Now we can march into Congress with drums
      beating and colors flying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well&mdash;well. I&rsquo;m sadly bewildered, sadly bewildered. I
      can&rsquo;t understand it at all&mdash;the most extraordinary woman that ever&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      a great day, it&rsquo;s a great day. There&mdash;there&mdash;let me put my hand
      in benediction on this precious head. Ah, my child, the poor negro will
      bless&mdash;&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Oh bother the poor negro, uncle! Put it in your speech. Good-night,
      good-bye&mdash;we&rsquo;ll marshal our forces and march with the dawn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura reflected a while, when she was alone, and then fell to laughing,
      peacefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody works for me,&rdquo;&mdash;so ran her thought. &ldquo;It was a good idea to
      make Buckstone lead Mr. Trollop on to get a great speech written for him;
      and it was a happy part of the same idea for me to copy the speech after
      Mr. Buckstone had written it, and then keep back a page. Mr. B. was very
      complimentary to me when Trollop&rsquo;s break-down in the House showed him the
      object of my mysterious scheme; I think he will say still finer things
      when I tell him the triumph the sequel to it has gained for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a coward the man was, to believe I would have exposed that page
      in the rotunda, and so exposed myself. However, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
      know. I will think a moment. Suppose he voted no; suppose the bill failed;
      that is to suppose this stupendous game lost forever, that I have played
      so desperately for; suppose people came around pitying me&mdash;odious!
      And he could have saved me by his single voice. Yes, I would have exposed
      him! What would I care for the talk that that would have made about me
      when I was gone to Europe with Selby and all the world was busy with my
      history and my dishonor? It would be almost happiness to spite somebody at
      such a time.&rdquo;

      <a name="ch43" id="ch43"></a>CHAPTER XLIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next day, sure enough, the campaign opened. In due course, the
      Speaker of the House reached that Order of Business which is termed
      &ldquo;Notices of Bills,&rdquo; and then the Hon. Mr. Buckstone rose in his place and
      gave notice of a bill &ldquo;To Found and Incorporate the Knobs Industrial
      University,&rdquo; and then sat down without saying anything further. The busy
      gentlemen in the reporters&rsquo; gallery jotted a line in their note-books, ran
      to the telegraphic desk in a room which communicated with their own
      writing-parlor, and then hurried back to their places in the gallery; and
      by the time they had resumed their seats, the line which they had
      delivered to the operator had been read in telegraphic offices in towns
      and cities hundreds of miles away. It was distinguished by frankness of
      language as well as by brevity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child is born. Buckstone gives notice of the thieving Knobs
      University job. It is said the noses have been counted and enough votes
      have been bought to pass it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time the correspondents had been posting their several journals
      upon the alleged disreputable nature of the bill, and furnishing daily
      reports of the Washington gossip concerning it. So the next morning,
      nearly every newspaper of character in the land assailed the measure and
      hurled broadsides of invective at Mr. Buckstone. The Washington papers
      were more respectful, as usual&mdash;and conciliatory, also, as usual.
      They generally supported measures, when it was possible; but when they
      could not they &ldquo;deprecated&rdquo; violent expressions of opinion in other
      journalistic quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      They always deprecated, when there was trouble ahead. However, &lsquo;The
      Washington Daily Love-Feast&rsquo; hailed the bill with warm approbation. This
      was Senator Balaam&rsquo;s paper&mdash;or rather, &ldquo;Brother&rdquo; Balaam, as he was
      popularly called, for he had been a clergyman, in his day; and he himself
      and all that he did still emitted an odor of sanctity now that he had
      diverged into journalism and politics. He was a power in the Congressional
      prayer meeting, and in all movements that looked to the spread of religion
      and temperance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His paper supported the new bill with gushing affection; it was a noble
      measure; it was a just measure; it was a generous measure; it was a pure
      measure, and that surely should recommend it in these corrupt times; and
      finally, if the nature of the bill were not known at all, the &lsquo;Love Feast&rsquo;
      would support it anyway, and unhesitatingly, for the fact that Senator
      Dilworthy was the originator of the measure was a guaranty that it
      contemplated a worthy and righteous work.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dilworthy was so anxious to know what the New York papers would
      say about the bill, that he had arranged to have synopses of their
      editorials telegraphed to him; he could not wait for the papers themselves
      to crawl along down to Washington by a mail train which has never run over
      a cow since the road was built; for the reason that it has never been able
      to overtake one. It carries the usual &ldquo;cow-catcher&rdquo; in front of the
      locomotive, but this is mere ostentation. It ought to be attached to the
      rear car, where it could do some good; but instead, no provision is made
      there for the protection of the traveling public, and hence it is not a
      matter of surprise that cows so frequently climb aboard that train and
      among the passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p392" id="p392"></a>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator read his dispatches aloud at the breakfast table. Laura was
      troubled beyond measure at their tone, and said that that sort of comment
      would defeat the bill; but the Senator said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not at all, not at all, my child. It is just what we want.
      Persecution is the one thing needful, now&mdash;all the other forces are
      secured. Give us newspaper persecution enough, and we are safe. Vigorous
      persecution will alone carry a bill sometimes, dear; and when you start
      with a strong vote in the first place, persecution comes in with double
      effect. It scares off some of the weak supporters, true, but it soon turns
      strong ones into stubborn ones. And then, presently, it changes the tide
      of public opinion. The great public is weak-minded; the great public is
      sentimental; the great public always turns around and weeps for an odious
      murderer, and prays for him, and carries flowers to his prison and
      besieges the governor with appeals to his clemency, as soon as the papers
      begin to howl for that man&rsquo;s blood.&mdash;In a word, the great
      putty-hearted public loves to &lsquo;gush,&rsquo; and there is no such darling
      opportunity to gush as a case of persecution affords.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, uncle, dear; if your theory is right, let us go into raptures, for
      nobody can ask a heartier persecution than these editorials are
      furnishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not so sure of that, my daughter. I don&rsquo;t entirely like the tone of
      some of these remarks. They lack vim, they lack venom. Here is one calls
      it a &lsquo;questionable measure.&rsquo; Bah, there is no strength in that. This one
      is better; it calls it &lsquo;highway robbery.&rsquo; That sounds something like. But
      now this one seems satisfied to call it an &lsquo;iniquitous scheme&rsquo;.
      &lsquo;Iniquitous&rsquo; does not exasperate anybody; it is weak&mdash;puerile. The
      ignorant will imagine it to be intended for a compliment. But this other
      one&mdash;the one I read last&mdash;has the true ring: &lsquo;This vile, dirty
      effort to rob the public treasury, by the kites and vultures that now
      infest the filthy den called Congress&rsquo;&mdash;that is admirable, admirable!
      We must have more of that sort. But it will come&mdash;no fear of that;
      they&rsquo;re not warmed up, yet. A week from now you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle, you and Brother Balaam are bosom friends&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you get
      his paper to persecute us, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t worth while, my daughter. His support doesn&rsquo;t hurt a bill.
      Nobody reads his editorials but himself. But I wish the New York papers
      would talk a little plainer. It is annoying to have to wait a week for
      them to warm up. I expected better things at their hands&mdash;and time is
      precious, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the proper hour, according to his previous notice, Mr. Buckstone duly
      introduced his bill entitled &ldquo;An Act to Found and Incorporate the Knobs
      Industrial University,&rdquo; moved its proper reference, and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Speaker of the House rattled off this observation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fnobjectionbilltakuzhlcoixrssoreferred!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Habitues of the House comprehended that this long, lightning-heeled word
      signified that if there was no objection, the bill would take the
      customary course of a measure of its nature, and be referred to the
      Committee on Benevolent Appropriations, and that it was accordingly so
      referred. Strangers merely supposed that the Speaker was taking a gargle
      for some affection of the throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporters immediately telegraphed the introduction of the bill.&mdash;And
      they added:
    </p>

        &ldquo;The assertion that the bill will pass was premature. It is said that

       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The storm came, and during ten days it waxed more and more violent day by
      day. The great &ldquo;Negro University Swindle&rdquo; became the one absorbing topic
      of conversation throughout the Union. Individuals denounced it, journals
      denounced it, public meetings denounced it, the pictorial papers
      caricatured its friends, the whole nation seemed to be growing frantic
      over it. Meantime the Washington correspondents were sending such
      telegrams as these abroad in the land; Under date of&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        SATURDAY. &ldquo;Congressmen Jex and Fluke are wavering; it is believed they
        will desert the execrable bill.&rdquo; MONDAY. &ldquo;Jex and Fluke have deserted!&rdquo;
         THURSDAY. &ldquo;Tubbs and Huffy left the sinking ship last night&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Later on:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Three desertions. The University thieves are getting scared, though
        they will not own it.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Later:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The leaders are growing stubborn&mdash;they swear they can carry it,
        but it is now almost certain that they no longer have a majority!&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      After a day or two of reluctant and ambiguous telegrams:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Public sentiment seems changing, a trifle in favor of the bill&mdash;but
        only a trifle.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And still later:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is whispered that the Hon. Mr. Trollop has gone over to the pirates.
        It is probably a canard. Mr. Trollop has all along been the bravest and
        most efficient champion of virtue and the people against the bill, and
        the report is without doubt a shameless invention.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Next day:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With characteristic treachery, the truckling and pusillanimous reptile,
        Crippled-Speech Trollop, has gone over to the enemy. It is contended,
        now, that he has been a friend to the bill, in secret, since the day it
        was introduced, and has had bankable reasons for being so; but he
        himself declares that he has gone over because the malignant persecution
        of the bill by the newspapers caused him to study its provisions with
        more care than he had previously done, and this close examination
        revealed the fact that the measure is one in every way worthy of
        support. (Pretty thin!) It cannot be denied that this desertion has had
        a damaging effect. Jex and Fluke have returned to their iniquitous
        allegiance, with six or eight others of lesser calibre, and it is
        reported and believed that Tubbs and Huffy are ready to go back. It is
        feared that the University swindle is stronger to-day than it has ever
        been before.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Later-midnight:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is said that the committee will report the bill back to-morrow. Both
        sides are marshaling their forces, and the fight on this bill is
        evidently going to be the hottest of the session.&mdash;All Washington
        is boiling.&rdquo;

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy enough for another fellow to talk,&rdquo; said Harry, despondingly,
      after he had put Philip in possession of his view of the case. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy
      enough to say &lsquo;give her up,&rsquo; if you don&rsquo;t care for her. What am I going to
      do to give her up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Harry that it was a situation requiring some active measures.
      He couldn&rsquo;t realize that he had fallen hopelessly in love without some
      rights accruing to him for the possession of the object of his passion.
      Quiet resignation under relinquishment of any thing he wanted was not in
      his line. And when it appeared to him that his surrender of Laura would be
      the withdrawal of the one barrier that kept her from ruin, it was
      unreasonable to expect that he could see how to give her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had the most buoyant confidence in his own projects always; he saw
      everything connected with himself in a large way and in rosy lines. This
      predominance of the imagination over the judgment gave that appearance of
      exaggeration to his conversation and to his communications with regard to
      himself, which sometimes conveyed the impression that he was not speaking
      the truth. His acquaintances had been known to say that they invariably
      allowed a half for shrinkage in his statements, and held the other half
      under advisement for confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip in this case could not tell from Harry&rsquo;s story exactly how much
      encouragement Laura had given him, nor what hopes he might justly have of
      winning her. He had never seen him desponding before. The &ldquo;brag&rdquo; appeared
      to be all taken out of him, and his airy manner only asserted itself now
      and then in a comical imitation of its old self.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip wanted time to look about him before he decided what to do. He was
      not familiar with Washington, and it was difficult to adjust his feelings
      and perceptions to its peculiarities. Coming out of the sweet sanity of
      the Bolton household, this was by contrast the maddest Vanity Fair one
      could conceive. It seemed to him a feverish, unhealthy atmosphere in which
      lunacy would be easily developed. He fancied that everybody attached to
      himself an exaggerated importance, from the fact of being at the national
      capital, the center of political influence, the fountain of patronage,
      preferment, jobs and opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      People were introduced to each other as from this or that state, not from
      cities or towns, and this gave a largeness to their representative
      feeling. All the women talked politics as naturally and glibly as they
      talk fashion or literature elsewhere. There was always some exciting topic
      at the Capitol, or some huge slander was rising up like a miasmatic
      exhalation from the Potomac, threatening to settle no one knew exactly
      where. Every other person was an aspirant for a place, or, if he had one,
      for a better place, or more pay; almost every other one had some claim or
      interest or remedy to urge; even the women were all advocates for the
      advancement of some person, and they violently espoused or denounced this
      or that measure as it would affect some relative, acquaintance or friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love, travel, even death itself, waited on the chances of the dies daily
      thrown in the two Houses, and the committee rooms there. If the measure
      went through, love could afford to ripen into marriage, and longing for
      foreign travel would have fruition; and it must have been only eternal
      hope springing in the breast that kept alive numerous old claimants who
      for years and years had besieged the doors of Congress, and who looked as
      if they needed not so much an appropriation of money as six feet of
      ground. And those who stood so long waiting for success to bring them
      death were usually those who had a just claim.

    <p>
      Representing states and talking of national and even international
      affairs, as familiarly as neighbors at home talk of poor crops and the
      extravagance of their ministers, was likely at first to impose upon Philip
      as to the importance of the people gathered here.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little newspaper editor from Phil&rsquo;s native town, the assistant
      on a Peddletonian weekly, who made his little annual joke about the &ldquo;first
      egg laid on our table,&rdquo; and who was the menial of every tradesman in the
      village and under bonds to him for frequent &ldquo;puffs,&rdquo; except the
      undertaker, about whose employment he was recklessly facetious. In
      Washington he was an important man, correspondent, and clerk of two house
      committees, a &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in politics, and a confident critic of every woman
      and every man in Washington. He would be a consul no doubt by and by, at
      some foreign port, of the language of which he was ignorant&mdash;though
      if ignorance of language were a qualification he might have been a consul
      at home. His easy familiarity with great men was beautiful to see, and
      when Philip learned what a tremendous underground influence this little
      ignoramus had, he no longer wondered at the queer appointments and the
      queerer legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p399" id="p399"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p399.jpg (14K)" src="images/p399.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was not long in discovering that people in Washington did not
      differ much from other people; they had the same meannesses, generosities,
      and tastes: A Washington boarding house had the odor of a boarding house
      the world over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Sellers was as unchanged as any one Philip saw whom he had known
      elsewhere. Washington appeared to be the native element of this man. His
      pretentions were equal to any he encountered there. He saw nothing in its
      society that equalled that of Hawkeye, he sat down to no table that could
      not be unfavorably contrasted with his own at home; the most airy scheme
      inflated in the hot air of the capital only reached in magnitude some of
      his lesser fancies, the by-play of his constructive imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The country is getting along very well,&rdquo; he said to Philip, &ldquo;but our
      public men are too timid. What we want is more money. I&rsquo;ve told Boutwell
      so. Talk about basing the currency on gold; you might as well base it on
      pork. Gold is only one product. Base it on everything! You&rsquo;ve got to do
      something for the West. How am I to move my crops? We must have
      improvements. Grant&rsquo;s got the idea. We want a canal from the James River
      to the Mississippi. Government ought to build it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to get the Colonel off from these large themes when he
      was once started, but Philip brought the conversation round to Laura and
      her reputation in the City.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t noticed much. We&rsquo;ve been so busy about this
      University. It will make Laura rich with the rest of us, and she has done
      nearly as much as if she were a man. She has great talent, and will make a
      big match. I see the foreign ministers and that sort after her. Yes, there
      is talk, always will be about a pretty woman so much in public as she is.
      Tough stories come to me, but I put&rsquo;em away. &lsquo;Taint likely one of Si
      Hawkins&rsquo;s children would do that&mdash;for she is the same as a child of
      his. I told her, though, to go slow,&rdquo; added the Colonel, as if that
      mysterious admonition from him would set everything right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything about a Col. Selby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know all about him. Fine fellow. But he&rsquo;s got a wife; and I told him, as
      a friend, he&rsquo;d better sheer off from Laura. I reckon he thought better of
      it and did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Philip was not long in learning the truth. Courted as Laura was by a
      certain class and still admitted into society, that, nevertheless, buzzed
      with disreputable stories about her, she had lost character with the best
      people. Her intimacy with Selby was open gossip, and there were winks and
      thrustings of the tongue in any group of men when she passed by. It was
      clear enough that Harry&rsquo;s delusion must be broken up, and that no such
      feeble obstacle as his passion could interpose would turn Laura from her
      fate. Philip determined to see her, and put himself in possession of the
      truth, as he suspected it, in order to show Harry his folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura, after her last conversation with Harry, had a new sense of her
      position. She had noticed before the signs of a change in manner towards
      her, a little less respect perhaps from men, and an avoidance by women.
      She had attributed this latter partly to jealousy of her, for no one is
      willing to acknowledge a fault in himself when a more agreeable motive can
      be found for the estrangement of his acquaintances. But now, if society
      had turned on her, she would defy it. It was not in her nature to shrink.
      She knew she had been wronged, and she knew that she had no remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What she heard of Col. Selby&rsquo;s proposed departure alarmed her more than
      anything else, and she calmly determined that if he was deceiving her the
      second time it should be the last. Let society finish the tragedy if it
      liked; she was indifferent what came after. At the first opportunity, she
      charged Selby with his intention to abandon her. He unblushingly denied
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not thought of going to Europe. He had only been amusing himself
      with Sellers&rsquo; schemes. He swore that as soon as she succeeded with her
      bill, he would fly with her to any part of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not quite believe him, for she saw that he feared her, and she
      began to suspect that his were the protestations of a coward to gain time.
      But she showed him no doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She only watched his movements day by day, and always held herself ready
      to act promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Philip came into the presence of this attractive woman, he could not
      realize that she was the subject of all the scandal he had heard. She
      received him with quite the old Hawkeye openness and cordiality, and fell
      to talking at once of their little acquaintance there; and it seemed
      impossible that he could ever say to her what he had come determined to
      say. Such a man as Philip has only one standard by which to judge women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura recognized that fact no doubt. The better part of her woman&rsquo;s nature
      saw it. Such a man might, years ago, not now, have changed her nature, and
      made the issue of her life so different, even after her cruel abandonment.
      She had a dim feeling of this, and she would like now to stand well with
      him. The spark of truth and honor that was left in her was elicited by his
      presence. It was this influence that governed her conduct in this
      interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said Philip in his direct manner, &ldquo;from my friend Mr.
      Brierly. You are not ignorant of his feeling towards you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But perhaps you do not know, you who have so much admiration, how sincere
      and overmastering his love is for you?&rdquo; Philip would not have spoken so
      plainly, if he had in mind anything except to draw from Laura something
      that would end Harry&rsquo;s passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is sincere love so rare, Mr. Sterling?&rdquo; asked Laura, moving her foot
      a little, and speaking with a shade of sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not in Washington,&rdquo; replied Philip,&mdash;tempted into a similar
      tone. &ldquo;Excuse my bluntness,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;but would the knowledge of his
      love; would his devotion, make any difference to you in your Washington
      life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In respect to what?&rdquo; asked Laura quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to others. I won&rsquo;t equivocate&mdash;to Col. Selby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s face flushed with anger, or shame; she looked steadily at Philip
      and began,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By what right, sir,&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the right of friendship,&rdquo; interrupted Philip stoutly. &ldquo;It may matter
      little to you. It is everything to him. He has a Quixotic notion that you
      would turn back from what is before you for his sake. You cannot be
      ignorant of what all the city is talking of.&rdquo; Philip said this
      determinedly and with some bitterness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a full minute before Laura spoke. Both had risen, Philip as if to
      go, and Laura in suppressed excitement. When she spoke her voice was very
      unsteady, and she looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. I perfectly understand what you mean. Mr. Brierly is nothing&mdash;simply
      nothing. He is a moth singed, that is all&mdash;the trifler with women
      thought he was a wasp. I have no pity for him, not the least. You may tell
      him not to make a fool of himself, and to keep away. I say this on your
      account, not his. You are not like him. It is enough for me that you want
      it so. Mr. Sterling,&rdquo; she continued, looking up; and there were tears in
      her eyes that contradicted the hardness of her language, &ldquo;you might not
      pity him if you knew my history; perhaps you would not wonder at some
      things you hear. No; it is useless to ask me why it must be so. You can&rsquo;t
      make a life over&mdash;society wouldn&rsquo;t let you if you would&mdash;and
      mine must be lived as it is. There, sir, I&rsquo;m not offended; but it is
      useless for you to say anything more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip went away with his heart lightened about Harry, but profoundly
      saddened by the glimpse of what this woman might have been. He told Harry
      all that was necessary of the conversation&mdash;she was bent on going her
      own way, he had not the ghost of a chance&mdash;he was a fool, she had
      said, for thinking he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Harry accepted it meekly, and made up his own mind that Philip didn&rsquo;t
      know much about women.

    <p>
      The galleries of the House were packed, on the momentous day, not because
      the reporting of an important bill back by a committee was a thing to be
      excited about, if the bill were going to take the ordinary course
      afterward; it would be like getting excited over the empaneling of a
      coroner&rsquo;s jury in a murder case, instead of saving up one&rsquo;s emotions for
      the grander occasion of the hanging of the accused, two years later, after
      all the tedious forms of law had been gone through with.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suppose you understand that this coroner&rsquo;s jury is going to turn out
      to be a vigilance committee in disguise, who will hear testimony for an
      hour and then hang the murderer on the spot? That puts a different aspect
      upon the matter. Now it was whispered that the legitimate forms of
      procedure usual in the House, and which keep a bill hanging along for days
      and even weeks, before it is finally passed upon, were going to be
      overruled, in this case, and short work made of the measure; and so, what
      was beginning as a mere inquest might, turn out to be something very
      different.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of the day&rsquo;s business the Order of &ldquo;Reports of Committees&rdquo;
       was finally reached and when the weary crowds heard that glad announcement
      issue from the Speaker&rsquo;s lips they ceased to fret at the dragging delay,
      and plucked up spirit. The Chairman of the Committee on Benevolent
      Appropriations rose and made his report, and just then a blue-uniformed
      brass-mounted little page put a note into his hand.

        one day). Six others are sick, but expect to be about again tomorrow or
        next day, a friend tells me. A bold onslaught is worth trying. Go for a
        suspension of the rules! You will find we can swing a two-thirds vote&mdash;I
        am perfectly satisfied of it. The Lord&rsquo;s truth will prevail.<br /> <br />

      Mr. Buckstone had reported the bills from his committee, one by one,
      leaving the bill to the last. When the House had voted upon the acceptance
      or rejection of the report upon all but it, and the question now being
      upon its disposal&mdash;Mr. Buckstone begged that the House would give its
      attention to a few remarks which he desired to make. His committee had
      instructed him to report the bill favorably; he wished to explain the
      nature of the measure, and thus justify the committee&rsquo;s action; the
      hostility roused by the press would then disappear, and the bill would
      shine forth in its true and noble character. He said that its provisions
      were simple. It incorporated the Knobs Industrial University, locating it
      in East Tennessee, declaring it open to all persons without distinction of
      sex, color or religion, and committing its management to a board of
      perpetual trustees, with power to fill vacancies in their own number. It
      provided for the erection of certain buildings for the University,
      dormitories, lecture-halls, museums, libraries, laboratories, work-shops,
      furnaces, and mills. It provided also for the purchase of sixty-five
      thousand acres of land, (fully described) for the purposes of the
      University, in the Knobs of East Tennessee. And it appropriated [blank]
      dollars for the purchase of the Land, which should be the property of the
      national trustees in trust for the uses named.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every effort had been made to secure the refusal of the whole amount of
      the property of the Hawkins heirs in the Knobs, some seventy-five thousand
      acres Mr. Buckstone said. But Mr. Washington Hawkins (one of the heirs)
      objected. He was, indeed, very reluctant to sell any part of the land at
      any price; and indeed&mdash;this reluctance was justifiable when one
      considers how constantly and how greatly the property is rising in value.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the South needed, continued Mr. Buckstone, was skilled labor. Without
      that it would be unable to develop its mines, build its roads, work to
      advantage and without great waste its fruitful land, establish
      manufactures or enter upon a prosperous industrial career. Its laborers
      were almost altogether unskilled. Change them into intelligent, trained
      workmen, and you increased at once the capital, the resources of the
      entire south, which would enter upon a prosperity hitherto unknown. In
      five years the increase in local wealth would not only reimburse the
      government for the outlay in this appropriation, but pour untold wealth
      into the treasury.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the material view, and the least important in the honorable
      gentleman&rsquo;s opinion. [Here he referred to some notes furnished him by
      Senator Dilworthy, and then continued.] God had given us the care of these
      colored millions. What account should we render to Him of our stewardship?
      We had made them free. Should we leave them ignorant? We had cast them
      upon their own resources. Should we leave them without tools? We could not
      tell what the intentions of Providence are in regard to these peculiar
      people, but our duty was plain. The Knobs Industrial University would be a
      vast school of modern science and practice, worthy of a great nation. It
      would combine the advantages of Zurich, Freiburg, Creuzot and the
      Sheffield Scientific. Providence had apparently reserved and set apart the
      Knobs of East Tennessee for this purpose. What else were they for? Was it
      not wonderful that for more than thirty years, over a generation, the
      choicest portion of them had remained in one family, untouched, as if,
      separated for some great use!
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be asked why the government should buy this land, when it had
      millions of acres, more than the railroad companies desired, which, it
      might devote to this purpose? He answered, that the government had no such
      tract of land as this. It had nothing comparable to it for the purposes of
      the University: This was to be a school of mining, of engineering, of the
      working of metals, of chemistry, zoology, botany, manufactures,
      agriculture, in short of all the complicated industries that make a state
      great. There was no place for the location of such a school like the Knobs
      of East Tennessee. The hills abounded in metals of all sorts, iron in all
      its combinations, copper, bismuth, gold and silver in small quantities,
      platinum he believed, tin, aluminium; it was covered with forests and
      strange plants; in the woods were found the coon, the opossum, the fox,
      the deer and many other animals who roamed in the domain of natural
      history; coal existed in enormous quantity and no doubt oil; it was such a
      place for the practice of agricultural experiments that any student who
      had been successful there would have an easy task in any other portion of
      the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      No place offered equal facilities for experiments in mining, metallurgy,
      engineering. He expected to live to see the day, when the youth of the
      south would resort to its mines, its workshops, its laboratories, its
      furnaces and factories for practical instruction in all the great
      industrial pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      A noisy and rather ill-natured debate followed, now, and lasted hour after
      hour. The friends of the bill were instructed by the leaders to make no
      effort to check it; it was deemed better strategy to tire out the
      opposition; it was decided to vote down every proposition to adjourn, and
      so continue the sitting into the night; opponents might desert, then, one
      by one and weaken their party, for they had no personal stake in the bill.

      Sunset came, and still the fight went on; the gas was lit, the crowd in
      the galleries began to thin, but the contest continued; the crowd
      returned, by and by, with hunger and thirst appeased, and aggravated the
      hungry and thirsty House by looking contented and comfortable; but still
      the wrangle lost nothing of its bitterness. Recesses were moved
      plaintively by the opposition, and invariably voted down by the University
      army.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight the House presented a spectacle calculated to interest a
      stranger. The great galleries were still thronged&mdash;though only with
      men, now; the bright colors that had made them look like hanging gardens
      were gone, with the ladies. The reporters&rsquo; gallery, was merely occupied by
      one or two watchful sentinels of the quill-driving guild; the main body
      cared nothing for a debate that had dwindled to a mere vaporing of dull
      speakers and now and then a brief quarrel over a point of order; but there
      was an unusually large attendance of journalists in the reporters&rsquo;
      waiting-room, chatting, smoking, and keeping on the &lsquo;qui vive&rsquo; for the
      general irruption of the Congressional volcano that must come when the
      time was ripe for it. Senator Dilworthy and Philip were in the Diplomatic
      Gallery; Washington sat in the public gallery, and Col. Sellers was, not
      far away. The Colonel had been flying about the corridors and
      button-holing Congressmen all the evening, and believed that he had
      accomplished a world of valuable service; but fatigue was telling upon
      him, now, and he was quiet and speechless&mdash;for once. Below, a few
      Senators lounged upon the sofas set apart for visitors, and talked with
      idle Congressmen. A dreary member was speaking; the presiding officer was
      nodding; here and there little knots of members stood in the aisles,
      whispering together; all about the House others sat in all the various
      attitudes that express weariness; some, tilted back, had one or more legs
      disposed upon their desks; some sharpened pencils indolently; some
      scribbled aimlessly; some yawned and stretched; a great many lay upon
      their breasts upon the desks, sound asleep and gently snoring. The
      flooding gaslight from the fancifully wrought roof poured down upon the
      tranquil scene. Hardly a sound disturbed the stillness, save the
      monotonous eloquence of the gentleman who occupied the floor. Now and then
      a warrior of the opposition broke down under the pressure, gave it up, and
      went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Buckstone began to think it might be safe, now, to &ldquo;proceed to
      business.&rdquo; He consulted with Trollop and one or two others. Senator
      Dilworthy descended to the floor of the House and they went to meet him.
      After a brief comparison of notes, the Congressmen sought their seats and
      sent pages about the House with messages to friends. These latter
      instantly roused up, yawned, and began to look alert. The moment the floor
      was unoccupied, Mr. Buckstone rose, with an injured look, and said it was
      evident that the opponents of the bill were merely talking against time,
      hoping in this unbecoming way to tire out the friends of the measure and
      so defeat it. Such conduct might be respectable enough in a village
      debating society, but it was trivial among statesmen, it was out of place
      in so august an assemblage as the House of Representatives of the United
      States. The friends of the bill had been not only willing that its
      opponents should express their opinions, but had strongly desired it. They
      courted the fullest and freest discussion; but it seemed to him that this
      fairness was but illy appreciated, since gentlemen were capable of taking
      advantage of it for selfish and unworthy ends. This trifling had gone far
      enough. He called for the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      The instant Mr. Buckstone sat down, the storm burst forth. A dozen
      gentlemen sprang to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Speaker!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Speaker!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Speaker!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order! Order! Order! Question! Question!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sharp blows of the Speaker&rsquo;s gavel rose above the din.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;previous question,&rdquo; that hated gag, was moved and carried. All debate
      came to a sudden end, of course. Triumph No. 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the vote was taken on the adoption of the report and it carried by a
      surprising majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Buckstone got the floor again and moved that the rules be suspended
      and the bill read a first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Trollop&mdash;&ldquo;Second the motion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Speaker&mdash;&ldquo;It is moved and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clamor of Voices. &ldquo;Move we adjourn! Second the motion! Adjourn! Adjourn!
      Order! Order!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Speaker, (after using his gavel vigorously)&mdash;&ldquo;It is moved and
      seconded that the House do now adjourn. All those in favor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Voices&mdash;&ldquo;Division! Division! Ayes and nays! Ayes and nays!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was decided to vote upon the adjournment by ayes and nays. This was in
      earnest. The excitement was furious. The galleries were in commotion in an
      instant, the reporters swarmed to their places. Idling members of the
      House flocked to their seats, nervous gentlemen sprang to their feet,
      pages flew hither and thither, life and animation were visible everywhere,
      all the long ranks of faces in the building were kindled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This thing decides it!&rdquo; thought Mr. Buckstone; &ldquo;but let the fight
      proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The voting began, and every sound ceased but the calling if the names and
      the &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ldquo;No!&rdquo; &ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; of the responses. There was not a movement
      in the House; the people seemed to hold their breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voting ceased, and then there was an interval of dead silence while
      the clerk made up his count. There was a two-thirds vote on the University
      side&mdash;and two over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Speaker&mdash;&ldquo;The rules are suspended, the motion is carried&mdash;first
      reading of the bill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By one impulse the galleries broke forth into stormy applause, and even
      some of the members of the House were not wholly able to restrain their
      feelings. The Speaker&rsquo;s gavel came to the rescue and his clear voice
      followed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order, gentlemen&mdash;! The House will come to order! If spectators
      offend again, the Sergeant-at-arms will clear the galleries!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he cast his eyes aloft and gazed at some object attentively for a
      moment. All eyes followed the direction of the Speaker&rsquo;s, and then there
      was a general titter. The Speaker said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the Sergeant-at Arms inform the gentleman that his conduct is an
      infringement of the dignity of the House&mdash;and one which is not
      warranted by the state of the weather.&rdquo; Poor Sellers was the culprit. He
      sat in the front seat of the gallery, with his arms and his tired body
      overflowing the balustrade&mdash;sound asleep, dead to all excitements,
      all disturbances. The fluctuations of the Washington weather had
      influenced his dreams, perhaps, for during the recent tempest of applause
      he had hoisted his gingham umbrella, and calmly gone on with his slumbers.
      Washington Hawkins had seen the act, but was not near enough at hand to
      save his friend, and no one who was near enough desired to spoil the
      effect. But a neighbor stirred up the Colonel, now that the House had its
      eye upon him, and the great speculator furled his tent like the Arab. He
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul, I&rsquo;m so absent-minded when I get to thinking! I never wear
      an umbrella in the house&mdash;did anybody &lsquo;notice it&rsquo;? What-asleep?
      Indeed? And did you wake me sir? Thank you&mdash;thank you very much
      indeed. It might have fallen out of my hands and been injured. Admirable
      article, sir&mdash;present from a friend in Hong Kong; one doesn&rsquo;t come
      across silk like that in this country&mdash;it&rsquo;s the real&mdash;Young
      Hyson, I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p412" id="p412"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p412.jpg (73K)" src="images/p412.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the incident was forgotten, for the House was at war again.
      Victory was almost in sight, now, and the friends of the bill threw
      themselves into their work with enthusiasm. They soon moved and carried
      its second reading, and after a strong, sharp fight, carried a motion to
      go into Committee of the whole. The Speaker left his place, of course, and
      a chairman was appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the contest raged hotter than ever&mdash;for the authority that
      compels order when the House sits as a House, is greatly diminished when
      it sits as Committee. The main fight came upon the filling of the blanks
      with the sum to be appropriated for the purchase of the land, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckstone&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, I move you, sir, that the words &lsquo;three
      millions of&rsquo; be inserted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hadley&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, I move that the words two and a half
      dollars be inserted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clawson&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, I move the insertion of the words five
      and twenty cents, as representing the true value of this barren and
      isolated tract of desolation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question, according to rule, was taken upon the smallest sum first. It
      was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then upon the next smallest sum. Lost, also.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then upon the three millions. After a vigorous battle that lasted a
      considerable time, this motion was carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, clause by clause the bill was read, discussed, and amended in
      trifling particulars, and now the Committee rose and reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the House had resumed its functions and received the report,
      Mr. Buckstone moved and carried the third reading of the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same bitter war over the sum to be paid was fought over again, and now
      that the ayes and nays could be called and placed on record, every man was
      compelled to vote by name on the three millions, and indeed on every
      paragraph of the bill from the enacting clause straight through. But as
      before, the friends of the measure stood firm and voted in a solid body
      every time, and so did its enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supreme moment was come, now, but so sure was the result that not even
      a voice was raised to interpose an adjournment. The enemy were totally
      demoralized. The bill was put upon its final passage almost without
      dissent, and the calling of the ayes and nays began. When it was ended the
      triumph was complete&mdash;the two-thirds vote held good, and a veto was
      impossible, as far as the House was concerned!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Buckstone resolved that now that the nail was driven home, he would
      clinch it on the other side and make it stay forever. He moved a
      reconsideration of the vote by which the bill had passed. The motion was
      lost, of course, and the great Industrial University act was an
      accomplished fact as far as it was in the power of the House of
      Representatives to make it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no need to move an adjournment. The instant the last motion was
      decided, the enemies of the University rose and flocked out of the Hall,
      talking angrily, and its friends flocked after them jubilant and
      congratulatory. The galleries disgorged their burden, and presently the
      house was silent and deserted.

    <p>
      When Col. Sellers and Washington stepped out of the building they were
      surprised to find that the daylight was old and the sun well up. Said the
      Colonel:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me your hand, my boy! You&rsquo;re all right at last! You&rsquo;re a
      millionaire! At least you&rsquo;re going to be. The thing is dead sure. Don&rsquo;t
      you bother about the Senate. Leave me and Dilworthy to take care of that.
      Run along home, now, and tell Laura. Lord, it&rsquo;s magnificent news&mdash;perfectly
      magnificent! Run, now. I&rsquo;ll telegraph my wife. She must come here and help
      me build a house. Everything&rsquo;s all right now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington was so dazed by his good fortune and so bewildered by the gaudy
      pageant of dreams that was already trailing its long ranks through his
      brain, that he wandered he knew not where, and so loitered by the way that
      when at last he reached home he woke to a sudden annoyance in the fact
      that his news must be old to Laura, now, for of course Senator Dilworthy
      must have already been home and told her an hour before. He knocked at her
      door, but there was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is like the Duchess,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Always cool; a body can&rsquo;t excite
      her-can&rsquo;t keep her excited, anyway. Now she has gone off to sleep again,
      as comfortably as if she were used to picking up a million dollars every
      day or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went to bed. But he could not sleep; so he got up and wrote a
      long, rapturous letter to Louise, and another to his mother. And he closed
      both to much the same effect:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Laura will be queen of America, now, and she will be applauded, and
        honored and petted by the whole nation. Her name will be in every one&rsquo;s
        mouth more than ever, and how they will court her and quote her bright
        speeches. And mine, too, I suppose; though they do that more already,
        than they really seem to deserve. Oh, the world is so bright, now, and
        so cheery; the clouds are all gone, our long struggle is ended, our
        troubles are all over. Nothing can ever make us unhappy any more. You
        dear faithful ones will have the reward of your patient waiting now. How
        father&rsquo;s Wisdom is proven at last! And how I repent me, that there have
        been times when I lost faith and said, the blessing he stored up for us
        a tedious generation ago was but a long-drawn curse, a blight upon us
        all. But everything is well, now&mdash;we are done with poverty, sad
        toil, weariness and heart-break; all the world is filled with sunshine.&rdquo;

    <p>
      Philip left the capitol and walked up Pennsylvania Avenue in company with
      Senator Dilworthy. It was a bright spring morning, the air was soft and
      inspiring; in the deepening wayside green, the pink flush of the
      blossoming peach trees, the soft suffusion on the heights of Arlington,
      and the breath of the warm south wind was apparent, the annual miracle of
      the resurrection of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator took off his hat and seemed to open his soul to the sweet
      influences of the morning. After the heat and noise of the chamber, under
      its dull gas-illuminated glass canopy, and the all night struggle of
      passion and feverish excitement there, the open, tranquil world seemed
      like Heaven. The Senator was not in an exultant mood, but rather in a
      condition of holy joy, befitting a Christian statesman whose benevolent
      plans Providence has made its own and stamped with approval. The great
      battle had been fought, but the measure had still to encounter the
      scrutiny of the Senate, and Providence sometimes acts differently in the
      two Houses. Still the Senator was tranquil, for he knew that there is an
      esprit de corps in the Senate which does not exist in the House, the
      effect of which is to make the members complaisant towards the projects of
      each other, and to extend a mutual aid which in a more vulgar body would
      be called &ldquo;log-rolling.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;It is, under Providence, a good night&rsquo;s work, Mr. Sterling. The
      government has founded an institution which will remove half the
      difficulty from the southern problem. And it is a good thing for the
      Hawkins heirs, a very good thing. Laura will be almost a millionaire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, Mr. Dilworthy, that the Hawkinses will get much of the
      money?&rdquo; asked Philip innocently, remembering the fate of the Columbus
      River appropriation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator looked at his companion scrutinizingly for a moment to see if
      he meant anything personal, and then replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly, undoubtedly. I have had their interests greatly at heart.
      There will of course be a few expenses, but the widow and orphans will
      realize all that Mr. Hawkins, dreamed of for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The birds were singing as they crossed the Presidential Square, now bright
      with its green turf and tender foliage. After the two had gained the steps
      of the Senator&rsquo;s house they stood a moment, looking upon the lovely
      prospect:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is like the peace of God,&rdquo; said the Senator devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering the house, the Senator called a servant and said, &ldquo;Tell Miss
      Laura that we are waiting to see her. I ought to have sent a messenger on
      horseback half an hour ago,&rdquo; he added to Philip, &ldquo;she will be transported
      with our victory. You must stop to breakfast, and see the excitement.&rdquo; The
      servant soon came back, with a wondering look and reported,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Laura ain&rsquo;t dah, sah. I reckon she hain&rsquo;t been dah all night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p418" id="p418"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p418.jpg (24K)" src="images/p418.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator and Philip both started up. In Laura&rsquo;s room there were the
      marks of a confused and hasty departure, drawers half open, little
      articles strewn on the floor. The bed had not been disturbed. Upon inquiry
      it appeared that Laura had not been at dinner, excusing herself to Mrs.
      Dilworthy on the plea of a violent headache; that she made a request to
      the servants that she might not be disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator was astounded. Philip thought at once of Col. Selby. Could
      Laura have run away with him? The Senator thought not. In fact it could
      not be. Gen. Leffenwell, the member from New Orleans, had casually told
      him at the house last night that Selby and his family went to New York
      yesterday morning and were to sail for Europe to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had another idea which, he did not mention. He seized his hat, and
      saying that he would go and see what he could learn, ran to the lodgings
      of Harry; whom he had not seen since yesterday afternoon, when he left him
      to go to the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was not in. He had gone out with a hand-bag before six o&rsquo;clock
      yesterday, saying that he had to go to New York, but should return next
      day. In Harry&rsquo;s-room on the table Philip found this note:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear Mr. Brierly:&mdash;Can you meet me at the six o&rsquo;clock train, and
        be my escort to New York? I have to go about this University bill, the
        vote of an absent member we must have here, Senator Dilworthy cannot go.<br />
        <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours,
        L. H.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it,&rdquo; said Phillip, &ldquo;the noodle has fallen into her trap. And she
      promised she would let him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He only stopped to send a note to Senator Dilworthy, telling him what he
      had found, and that he should go at once to New York, and then hastened to
      the railway station. He had to wait an hour for a train, and when it did
      start it seemed to go at a snail&rsquo;s pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was devoured with anxiety. Where could they have gone? What was
      Laura&rsquo;s object in taking Harry? Had the flight anything to do with Selby?
      Would Harry be such a fool as to be dragged into some public scandal?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed as if the train would never reach Baltimore. Then there was a
      long delay at Havre de Grace. A hot box had to be cooled at Wilmington.
      Would it never get on? Only in passing around the city of Philadelphia did
      the train not seem to go slow. Philip stood upon the platform and watched
      for the Boltons&rsquo; house, fancied he could distinguish its roof among the
      trees, and wondered how Ruth would feel if she knew he was so near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Jersey, everlasting Jersey, stupid irritating Jersey, where the
      passengers are always asking which line they are on, and where they are to
      come out, and whether they have yet reached Elizabeth. Launched into
      Jersey, one has a vague notion that he is on many lines and no one in
      particular, and that he is liable at any moment to come to Elizabeth. He
      has no notion what Elizabeth is, and always resolves that the next time he
      goes that way, he will look out of the window and see what it is like; but
      he never does. Or if he does, he probably finds that it is Princeton or
      something of that sort. He gets annoyed, and never can see the use of
      having different names for stations in Jersey. By and by there is Newark,
      three or four Newarks apparently; then marshes; then long rock cuttings
      devoted to the advertisements of patent medicines and ready-made,
      clothing, and New York tonics for Jersey agues, and Jersey City is
      reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the ferry-boat Philip bought an evening paper from a boy crying &ldquo;&lsquo;Ere&rsquo;s
      the Evening Gram, all about the murder,&rdquo; and with breathless haste&mdash;ran
      his eyes over the following:

      CAUSE!!!
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <br /> This morning occurred another of those shocking murders which have
        become the almost daily food of the newspapers, the direct result of the
        socialistic doctrines and woman&rsquo;s rights agitations, which have made
        every woman the avenger of her own wrongs, and all society the hunting
        ground for her victims.<br /> <br /> About nine o&rsquo;clock a lady
        deliberately shot a man dead in the public parlor of the Southern Hotel,
        coolly remarking, as she threw down her revolver and permitted herself
        to be taken into custody, &ldquo;He brought it on himself.&rdquo; Our reporters were
        immediately dispatched to the scene of the tragedy, and gathered the
        following particulars.<br /> <br /> Yesterday afternoon arrived at the
        hotel from Washington, Col. George Selby and family, who had taken
        passage and were to sail at noon to-day in the steamer Scotia for
        England. The Colonel was a handsome man about forty, a gentleman of
        wealth and high social position, a resident of New Orleans. He served
        with distinction in the confederate army, and received a wound in the
        leg from which he has never entirely recovered, being obliged to use a
        cane in locomotion.<br /> <br /> This morning at about nine o&rsquo;clock, a
        lady, accompanied by a gentleman, called at the office of the hotel and
        asked for Col. Selby. The Colonel was at breakfast. Would the clerk tell
        him that a lady and gentleman wished to see him for a moment in the
        parlor? The clerk says that the gentleman asked her, &ldquo;What do you want
        to see him for?&rdquo; and that she replied, &ldquo;He is going to Europe, and I
        ought to just say good by."<br /> <br /> Col. Selby was informed; and the
        lady and gentleman were shown to the parlor, in which were at the time
        three or four other persons. Five minutes after two shots were fired in
        quick succession, and there was a rush to the parlor from which the
        reports came.<br /> <br /> Col. Selby was found lying on the floor,
        bleeding, but not dead. Two gentlemen, who had just come in, had seized
        the lady, who made no resistance, and she was at once given in charge of
        a police officer who arrived. The persons who were in the parlor agree
        substantially as to what occurred. They had happened to be looking
        towards the door when the man&mdash;Col. Selby&mdash;entered with his
        cane, and they looked at him, because he stopped as if surprised and
        frightened, and made a backward movement. At the same moment the lady in
        the bonnet advanced towards him and said something like, &ldquo;George, will
        you go with me?&rdquo; He replied, throwing up his hand and retreating, &ldquo;My
        God I can&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t fire,&rdquo; and the next instants two shots were heard and
        he fell. The lady appeared to be beside herself with rage or excitement,
        and trembled very much when the gentlemen took hold of her; it was to
        them she said, &ldquo;He brought it on himself."<br /> <br /> Col. Selby was
        carried at once to his room and Dr. Puffer, the eminent surgeon was sent
        for. It was found that he was shot through the breast and through the
        abdomen. Other aid was summoned, but the wounds were mortal, and Col
        Selby expired in an hour, in pain, but his mind was clear to the last
        and he made a full deposition. The substance of it was that his
        murderess is a Miss Laura Hawkins, whom he had known at Washington as a
        lobbyist and had some business with her. She had followed him with her
        attentions and solicitations, and had endeavored to make him desert his
        wife and go to Europe with her. When he resisted and avoided her she had
        threatened him. Only the day before he left Washington she had declared
        that he should never go out of the city alive without her.<br /> <br /> It
        seems to have been a deliberate and premeditated murder, the woman
        following him to Washington on purpose to commit it.<br /> <br /> We learn
        that the murderess, who is a woman of dazzling and transcendent beauty
        and about twenty six or seven, is a niece of Senator Dilworthy at whose
        house she has been spending the winter. She belongs to a high Southern
        family, and has the reputation of being an heiress. Like some other
        great beauties and belles in Washington however there have been whispers
        that she had something to do with the lobby. If we mistake not we have
        heard her name mentioned in connection with the sale of the Tennessee
        Lands to the Knobs University, the bill for which passed the House last
        night.<br /> <br /> Her companion is Mr. Harry Brierly, a New York dandy,
        who has been in Washington. His connection with her and with this
        tragedy is not known, but he was also taken into custody, and will be
        detained at least as a witness.<br /> <br /> P. S. One of the persons
        present in the parlor says that after Laura Hawkins had fired twice, she
        turned the pistol towards herself, but that Brierly sprung and caught it
        from her hand, and that it was he who threw it on the floor.<br /> <br />

        edition.

    <p>
      Philip hastened at once to the Southern Hotel, where he found still a
      great state of excitement, and a thousand different and exaggerated
      stories passing from mouth to mouth. The witnesses of the event had told
      it over so many times that they had worked it up into a most dramatic
      scene, and embellished it with whatever could heighten its awfulness.
      Outsiders had taken up invention also. The Colonel&rsquo;s wife had gone insane,
      they said. The children had rushed into the parlor and rolled themselves
      in their father&rsquo;s blood. The hotel clerk said that he noticed there was
      murder in the woman&rsquo;s eye when he saw her. A person who had met the woman
      on the stairs felt a creeping sensation. Some thought Brierly was an
      accomplice, and that he had set the woman on to kill his rival. Some said
      the woman showed the calmness and indifference of insanity.

    </p>
    <p>
      Philip learned that Harry and Laura had both been taken to the city
      prison, and he went there; but he was not admitted. Not being a newspaper
      reporter, he could not see either of them that night; but the officer
      questioned him suspiciously and asked him who he was. He might perhaps see
      Brierly in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest editions of the evening papers had the result of the inquest.
      It was a plain enough case for the jury, but they sat over it a long time,
      listening to the wrangling of the physicians. Dr. Puffer insisted that the
      man died from the effects of the wound in the chest. Dr. Dobb as strongly
      insisted that the wound in the abdomen caused death. Dr. Golightly
      suggested that in his opinion death ensued from a complication of the two
      wounds and perhaps other causes. He examined the table waiter, as to
      whether Col. Selby ate any breakfast, and what he ate, and if he had any
      appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p423" id="p423"></a>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The jury finally threw themselves back upon the indisputable fact that
      Selby was dead, that either wound would have killed him (admitted by the
      doctors), and rendered a verdict that he died from pistol-shot wounds
      inflicted by a pistol in the hands of Laura Hawkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning papers blazed with big type, and overflowed with details of
      the murder. The accounts in the evening papers were only the premonitory
      drops to this mighty shower. The scene was dramatically worked up in
      column after column. There were sketches, biographical and historical.
      There were long &ldquo;specials&rdquo; from Washington, giving a full history of
      Laura&rsquo;s career there, with the names of men with whom she was said to be
      intimate, a description of Senator Dilworthy&rsquo;s residence and of his
      family, and of Laura&rsquo;s room in his house, and a sketch of the Senator&rsquo;s
      appearance and what he said. There was a great deal about her beauty, her
      accomplishments and her brilliant position in society, and her doubtful
      position in society. There was also an interview with Col. Sellers and
      another with Washington Hawkins, the brother of the murderess. One journal
      had a long dispatch from Hawkeye, reporting the excitement in that quiet
      village and the reception of the awful intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the parties had been &ldquo;interviewed.&rdquo; There were reports of
      conversations with the clerk at the hotel; with the call-boy; with the
      waiter at table with all the witnesses, with the policeman, with the
      landlord (who wanted it understood that nothing of that sort had ever
      happened in his house before, although it had always been frequented by
      the best Southern society,) and with Mrs. Col. Selby. There were diagrams
      illustrating the scene of the shooting, and views of the hotel and street,
      and portraits of the parties.

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three minute and different statements from the doctors about
      the wounds, so technically worded that nobody could understand them. Harry
      and Laura had also been &ldquo;interviewed&rdquo; and there was a statement from
      Philip himself, which a reporter had knocked him up out of bed at midnight
      to give, though how he found him, Philip never could conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      What some of the journals lacked in suitable length for the occasion, they
      made up in encyclopaedic information about other similar murders and
      shootings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The statement from Laura was not full, in fact it was fragmentary, and
      consisted of nine parts of, the reporter&rsquo;s valuable observations to one of
      Laura&rsquo;s, and it was, as the reporter significantly remarked, &ldquo;incoherent&rdquo;,
      but it appeared that Laura claimed to be Selby&rsquo;s wife, or to have been his
      wife, that he had deserted her and betrayed her, and that she was going to
      follow him to Europe. When the reporter asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you shoot him, Miss Hawkins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s only reply was, very simply,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I shoot him? Do they say I shot him?&rdquo;. And she would say no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of the murder was made the excitement of the day. Talk of it
      filled the town. The facts reported were scrutinized, the standing of the
      parties was discussed, the dozen different theories of the motive,
      broached in the newspapers, were disputed over.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the night subtle electricity had carried the tale over all the
      wires of the continent and under the sea; and in all villages and towns of
      the Union, from the Atlantic to the territories, and away up and down the
      Pacific slope, and as far as London and Paris and Berlin, that morning the
      name of Laura Hawkins was spoken by millions and millions of people, while
      the owner of it&mdash;the sweet child of years ago, the beautiful queen of
      Washington drawing rooms&mdash;sat shivering on her cot-bed in the
      darkness of a damp cell in the Tombs.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip&rsquo;s first effort was to get Harry out of the Tombs. He gained
      permission to see him, in the presence of an officer, during the day, and
      he found that hero very much cast down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never intended to come to such a place as this, old fellow,&rdquo; he said to
      Philip; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no place for a gentleman, they&rsquo;ve no idea how to treat a
      gentleman. Look at that provender,&rdquo; pointing to his uneaten prison ration.
      &ldquo;They tell me I am detained as a witness, and I passed the night among a
      lot of cut-throats and dirty rascals&mdash;a pretty witness I&rsquo;d be in a
      month spent in such company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what under heavens,&rdquo; asked Philip, &ldquo;induced you to come to New York
      with Laura! What was it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? Why, she wanted me to come. I didn&rsquo;t know anything about that
      cursed Selby. She said it was lobby business for the University. I&rsquo;d no
      idea what she was dragging me into that confounded hotel for. I suppose
      she knew that the Southerners all go there, and thought she&rsquo;d find her
      man. Oh! Lord, I wish I&rsquo;d taken your advice. You might as well murder
      somebody and have the credit of it, as get into the newspapers the way I
      have. She&rsquo;s pure devil, that girl. You ought to have seen how sweet she
      was on me; what an ass I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not going to dispute a poor prisoner. But the first thing is to
      get you out of this. I&rsquo;ve brought the note Laura wrote you, for one thing,
      and I&rsquo;ve seen your uncle, and explained the truth of the case to him. He
      will be here soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry&rsquo;s uncle came, with other friends, and in the course of the day made
      such a showing to the authorities that Harry was released, on giving bonds
      to appear as a witness when wanted. His spirits rose with their usual
      elasticity as soon as he was out of Centre Street, and he insisted on
      giving Philip and his friends a royal supper at Delmonico&rsquo;s, an excess
      which was perhaps excusable in the rebound of his feelings, and which was
      committed with his usual reckless generosity. Harry ordered the supper,
      and it is perhaps needless to say that Philip paid the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the young men felt like attempting to see Laura that day, and
      she saw no company except the newspaper reporters, until the arrival of
      Col. Sellers and Washington Hawkins, who had hastened to New York with all
      speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Laura in a cell in the upper tier of the women&rsquo;s department.
      The cell was somewhat larger than those in the men&rsquo;s department, and might
      be eight feet by ten square, perhaps a little longer. It was of stone,
      floor and all, and tile roof was oven shaped. A narrow slit in the roof
      admitted sufficient light, and was the only means of ventilation; when the
      window was opened there was nothing to prevent the rain coming in. The
      only means of heating being from the corridor, when the door was ajar, the
      cell was chilly and at this time damp. It was whitewashed and clean, but
      it had a slight jail odor; its only furniture was a narrow iron bedstead,
      with a tick of straw and some blankets, not too clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Col. Sellers was conducted to this cell by the matron and looked in,
      his emotions quite overcame him, the tears rolled down his cheeks and his
      voice trembled so that he could hardly speak. Washington was unable to say
      anything; he looked from Laura to the miserable creatures who were walking
      in the corridor with unutterable disgust. Laura was alone calm and
      self-contained, though she was not unmoved by the sight of the grief of
      her friends.

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you comfortable, Laura?&rdquo; was the first word the Colonel could get
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s exactly comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you cold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is pretty chilly. The stone floor is like ice. It chills me through to
      step on it. I have to sit on the bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor thing, poor thing. And can you eat any thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not hungry. I don&rsquo;t know that I could eat any thing, I can&rsquo;t eat
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; continued the Colonel, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s dreadful. But cheer up, dear,
      cheer up;&rdquo; and the Colonel broke down entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll stand by you. We&rsquo;ll do everything for you. I
      know you couldn&rsquo;t have meant to do it, it must have been insanity, you
      know, or something of that sort. You never did anything of the sort
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura smiled very faintly and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was something of that sort. It&rsquo;s all a whirl. He was a villain;
      you don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have killed him myself, in a duel you know, all fair. I wish I
      had. But don&rsquo;t you be down. We&rsquo;ll get you the best counsel, the lawyers in
      New York can do anything; I&rsquo;ve read of cases. But you must be comfortable
      now. We&rsquo;ve brought some of your clothes, at the hotel. What else, can we
      get for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura suggested that she would like some sheets for her bed, a piece of
      carpet to step on, and her meals sent in; and some books and writing
      materials if it was allowed. The Colonel and Washington promised to
      procure all these things, and then took their sorrowful leave, a great
      deal more affected than the criminal was, apparently, by her situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colonel told the matron as he went away that if she would look to
      Laura&rsquo;s comfort a little it shouldn&rsquo;t be the worse for her; and to the
      turnkey who let them out he patronizingly said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a big establishment here, a credit to the city. I&rsquo;ve got a
      friend in there&mdash;I shall see you again, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p429" id="p429"></a>
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      By the next day something more of Laura&rsquo;s own story began to appear in the
      newspapers, colored and heightened by reporters&rsquo; rhetoric. Some of them
      cast a lurid light upon the Colonel&rsquo;s career, and represented his victim
      as a beautiful avenger of her murdered innocence; and others pictured her
      as his willing paramour and pitiless slayer. Her communications to the
      reporters were stopped by her lawyers as soon as they were retained and
      visited her, but this fact did not prevent&mdash;it may have facilitated&mdash;the
      appearance of casual paragraphs here and there which were likely to beget
      popular sympathy for the poor girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion did not pass without &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; by the leading journals;
      and Philip preserved the editorial comments of three or four of them which
      pleased him most. These he used to read aloud to his friends afterwards
      and ask them to guess from which journal each of them had been cut. One
      began in this simple manner:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        History never repeats itself, but the Kaleidoscopic combinations of the
        pictured present often seem to be constructed out of the broken
        fragments of antique legends. Washington is not Corinth, and Lais, the
        beautiful daughter of Timandra, might not have been the prototype of the
        ravishing Laura, daughter of the plebeian house of Hawkins; but the
        orators add statesmen who were the purchasers of the favors of the one,
        may have been as incorruptible as the Republican statesmen who learned
        how to love and how to vote from the sweet lips of the Washington
        lobbyist; and perhaps the modern Lais would never have departed from the
        national Capital if there had been there even one republican Xenocrates
        who resisted her blandishments. But here the parallel: fails. Lais,
        wandering away with the youth Rippostratus, is slain by the women who
        are jealous of her charms. Laura, straying into her Thessaly with the
        youth Brierly, slays her other lover and becomes the champion of the
        wrongs of her sex.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Another journal began its editorial with less lyrical beauty, but with
      equal force. It closed as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        With Laura Hawkins, fair, fascinating and fatal, and with the dissolute
        Colonel of a lost cause, who has reaped the harvest he sowed, we have
        nothing to do. But as the curtain rises on this awful tragedy, we catch
        a glimpse of the society at the capital under this Administration, which
        we cannot contemplate without alarm for the fate of the Republic.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A third newspaper took up the subject in a different tone. It said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Our repeated predictions are verified. The pernicious doctrines which we
        have announced as prevailing in American society have been again
        illustrated. The name of the city is becoming a reproach. We may have
        done something in averting its ruin in our resolute exposure of the
        Great Frauds; we shall not be deterred from insisting that the outraged
        laws for the protection of human life shall be vindicated now, so that a
        person can walk the streets or enter the public houses, at least in the
        day-time, without the risk of a bullet through his brain.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A fourth journal began its remarks as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The fullness with which we present our readers this morning the details
        of the Selby-Hawkins homicide is a miracle of modern journalism.
        Subsequent investigation can do little to fill out the picture. It is
        the old story. A beautiful woman shoots her absconding lover in
        cold-blood; and we shall doubtless learn in due time that if she was not
        as mad as a hare in this month of March, she was at least laboring under
        what is termed &ldquo;momentary insanity.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It would not be too much to say that upon the first publication of the
      facts of the tragedy, there was an almost universal feeling of rage
      against the murderess in the Tombs, and that reports of her beauty only
      heightened the indignation. It was as if she presumed upon that and upon
      her sex, to defy the law; and there was a fervent hope that the law would
      take its plain course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Laura was not without friends, and some of them very influential too.
      She had in her keeping a great many secrets and a great many reputations,
      perhaps. Who shall set himself up to judge human motives. Why, indeed,
      might we not feel pity for a woman whose brilliant career had been so
      suddenly extinguished in misfortune and crime? Those who had known her so
      well in Washington might find it impossible to believe that the
      fascinating woman could have had murder in her heart, and would readily
      give ear to the current sentimentality about the temporary aberration of
      mind under the stress of personal calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dilworthy, was greatly shocked, of course, but he was full of
      charity for the erring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall all need mercy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Laura as an inmate of my family was a
      most exemplary female, amiable, affectionate and truthful, perhaps too
      fond of gaiety, and neglectful of the externals of religion, but a woman
      of principle. She may have had experiences of which I am ignorant, but she
      could not have gone to this extremity if she had been in her own right
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To the Senator&rsquo;s credit be it said, he was willing to help Laura and her
      family in this dreadful trial. She, herself, was not without money, for
      the Washington lobbyist is not seldom more fortunate than the Washington
      claimant, and she was able to procure a good many luxuries to mitigate the
      severity of her prison life. It enabled her also to have her own family
      near her, and to see some of them daily. The tender solicitude of her
      mother, her childlike grief, and her firm belief in the real guiltlessness
      of her daughter, touched even the custodians of the Tombs who are enured
      to scenes of pathos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hawkins had hastened to her daughter as soon as she received money
      for the journey. She had no reproaches, she had only tenderness and pity.
      She could not shut out the dreadful facts of the case, but it had been
      enough for her that Laura had said, in their first interview, &ldquo;mother, I
      did not know what I was doing.&rdquo; She obtained lodgings near the prison and
      devoted her life to her daughter, as if she had been really her own child.
      She would have remained in the prison day and night if it had been
      permitted. She was aged and feeble, but this great necessity seemed to
      give her new life.

    <p>
      The pathetic story of the old lady&rsquo;s ministrations, and her simplicity and
      faith, also got into the newspapers in time, and probably added to the
      pathos of this wrecked woman&rsquo;s fate, which was beginning to be felt by the
      public. It was certain that she had champions who thought that her wrongs
      ought to be placed against her crime, and expressions of this feeling came
      to her in various ways. Visitors came to see her, and gifts of fruit and
      flowers were sent, which brought some cheer into her hard and gloomy cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura had declined to see either Philip or Harry, somewhat to the former&rsquo;s
      relief, who had a notion that she would necessarily feel humiliated by
      seeing him after breaking faith with him, but to the discomfiture of
      Harry, who still felt her fascination, and thought her refusal heartless.
      He told Philip that of course he had got through with such a woman, but he
      wanted to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip, to keep him from some new foolishness, persuaded him to go with
      him to Philadelphia; and, give his valuable services in the mining
      operations at Ilium.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law took its course with Laura. She was indicted for murder in the
      first degree and held for trial at the summer term. The two most
      distinguished criminal lawyers in the city had been retained for her
      defence, and to that the resolute woman devoted her days with a courage
      that rose as she consulted with her counsel and understood the methods of
      criminal procedure in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was greatly depressed, however, by the news from Washington. Congress
      adjourned and her bill had failed to pass the Senate. It must wait for the
      next session.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a bad winter, somehow, for the firm of Pennybacker, Bigler and
      Small. These celebrated contractors usually made more money during the
      session of the legislature at Harrisburg than upon all their summer work,
      and this winter had been unfruitful. It was unaccountable to Bigler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Mr. Bolton,&rdquo; he said, and Philip was present at the
      conversation, &ldquo;it puts us all out. It looks as if politics was played out.
      We&rsquo;d counted on the year of Simon&rsquo;s re-election. And, now, he&rsquo;s reelected,
      and I&rsquo;ve yet to see the first man who&rsquo;s the better for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; asked Philip, &ldquo;that he went in without paying
      anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a cent, not a dash cent, as I can hear,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Bigler,
      indignantly. &ldquo;I call it a swindle on the state. How it was done gets me. I
      never saw such a tight time for money in Harrisburg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were there no combinations, no railroad jobs, no mining schemes put
      through in connection with the election?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I knew,&rdquo; said Bigler, shaking his head in disgust. &ldquo;In fact it
      was openly said, that there was no money in the election. It&rsquo;s perfectly
      unheard of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Philip, &ldquo;it was effected on what the insurance
      companies call the &lsquo;endowment,&rsquo; or the &lsquo;paid up&rsquo; plan, by which a policy
      is secured after a certain time without further payment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think then,&rdquo; said Mr. Bolton smiling, &ldquo;that a liberal and sagacious
      politician might own a legislature after a time, and not be bothered with
      keeping up his payments?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever it is,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Bigler, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s devilish ingenious and
      goes ahead of my calculations; it&rsquo;s cleaned me out, when I thought we had
      a dead sure thing. I tell you what it is, gentlemen, I shall go in for
      reform. Things have got pretty mixed when a legislature will give away a
      United States senatorship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p435" id="p435"></a>
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was melancholy, but Mr. Bigler was not a man to be crushed by one
      misfortune, or to lose his confidence in human nature, on one exhibition
      of apparent honesty. He was already on his feet again, or would be if Mr.
      Bolton could tide him over shoal water for ninety days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got something with money in it,&rdquo; he explained to Mr. Bolton, &ldquo;got
      hold of it by good luck. We&rsquo;ve got the entire contract for Dobson&rsquo;s Patent
      Pavement for the city of Mobile. See here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigler made some figures; contract so much, cost of work and materials
      so much, profits so much. At the end of three months the city would owe
      the company three hundred and seventy-five thousand dollars-two hundred
      thousand of that would be profits. The whole job was worth at least a
      million to the company&mdash;it might be more. There could be no mistake
      in these figures; here was the contract, Mr. Bolton knew what materials
      were worth and what the labor would cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bolton knew perfectly well from sore experience that there was always
      a mistake in figures when Bigler or Small made them, and he knew that he
      ought to send the fellow about his business. Instead of that, he let him
      talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      They only wanted to raise fifty thousand dollars to carry on the contract&mdash;that
      expended they would have city bonds. Mr. Bolton said he hadn&rsquo;t the money.
      But Bigler could raise it on his name. Mr. Bolton said he had no right to
      put his family to that risk. But the entire contract could be assigned to
      him&mdash;the security was ample&mdash;it was a fortune to him if it was
      forfeited. Besides Mr. Bigler had been unfortunate, he didn&rsquo;t know where
      to look for the necessaries of life for his family. If he could only have
      one more chance, he was sure he could right himself. He begged for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Bolton yielded. He could never refuse such appeals. If he had
      befriended a man once and been cheated by him, that man appeared to have a
      claim upon him forever. He shrank, however, from telling his wife what he
      had done on this occasion, for he knew that if any person was more odious
      than Small to his family it was Bigler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip tells me,&rdquo; Mrs. Bolton said that evening, &ldquo;that the man Bigler has
      been with thee again to-day. I hope thee will have nothing more to do with
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been very unfortunate,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bolton, uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is always unfortunate, and he is always getting thee into trouble. But
      thee didn&rsquo;t listen to him again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother, his family is in want, and I lent him my name&mdash;but I
      took ample security. The worst that can happen will be a little
      inconvenience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bolton looked grave and anxious, but she did not complain or
      remonstrate; she knew what a &ldquo;little inconvenience&rdquo; meant, but she knew
      there was no help for it. If Mr. Bolton had been on his way to market to
      buy a dinner for his family with the only dollar he had in the world in
      his pocket, he would have given it to a chance beggar who asked him for
      it. Mrs. Bolton only asked (and the question showed that she was no mere
      provident than her husband where her heart was interested),
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But has thee provided money for Philip to use in opening the coal mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have set apart as much as it ought to cost to open the mine, as
      much as we can afford to lose if no coal is found. Philip has the control
      of it, as equal partner in the venture, deducting the capital invested. He
      has great confidence in his success, and I hope for his sake he won&rsquo;t be
      disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip could not but feel that he was treated very much like one of the
      Bolton-family&mdash;by all except Ruth. His mother, when he went home
      after his recovery from his accident, had affected to be very jealous of
      Mrs. Bolton, about whom and Ruth she asked a thousand questions&mdash;an
      affectation of jealousy which no doubt concealed a real heartache, which
      comes to every mother when her son goes out into the world and forms new
      ties. And to Mrs. Sterling, a widow, living on a small income in a remote
      Massachusetts village, Philadelphia was a city of many splendors. All its
      inhabitants seemed highly favored, dwelling in ease and surrounded by
      superior advantages. Some of her neighbors had relations living in
      Philadelphia, and it seemed to them somehow a guarantee of respectability
      to have relations in Philadelphia. Mrs. Sterling was not sorry to have
      Philip make his way among such well-to-do people, and she was sure that no
      good fortune could be too good for his deserts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, sir,&rdquo; said Ruth, when Philip came from New York, &ldquo;you have been
      assisting in a pretty tragedy. I saw your name in the papers. Is this
      woman a specimen of your western friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My only assistance,&rdquo; replied Philip, a little annoyed, &ldquo;was in trying to
      keep Harry out of a bad scrape, and I failed after all. He walked into her
      trap, and he has been punished for it. I&rsquo;m going to take him up to Ilium
      to see if he won&rsquo;t work steadily at one thing, and quit his nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she as beautiful as the newspapers say she is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, she has a kind of beauty&mdash;she is not like&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not like Alice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she is brilliant; she was called the handsomest woman in Washington&mdash;dashing,
      you know, and sarcastic and witty. Ruth, do you believe a woman ever
      becomes a devil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men do, and I don&rsquo;t know why women shouldn&rsquo;t. But I never saw one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Laura Hawkins comes very near it. But it is dreadful to think of
      her fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, do you suppose they will hang a woman? Do you suppose they will be
      so barbarous as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of that&mdash;it&rsquo;s doubtful if a New York jury would
      find a woman guilty of any such crime. But to think of her life if she is
      acquitted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dreadful,&rdquo; said Ruth, thoughtfully, &ldquo;but the worst of it is that
      you men do not want women educated to do anything, to be able to earn an
      honest living by their own exertions. They are educated as if they were
      always to be petted and supported, and there was never to be any such
      thing as misfortune. I suppose, now, that you would all choose to have me
      stay idly at home, and give up my profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Philip, earnestly, &ldquo;I respect your resolution. But, Ruth,
      do you think you would be happier or do more good in following your
      profession than in having a home of your own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is to hinder having a home of my own?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, perhaps, only you never would be in it&mdash;you would be away
      day and night, if you had any practice; and what sort of a home would that
      make for your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of a home is it for the wife whose husband is always away
      riding about in his doctor&rsquo;s gig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you know that is not fair. The woman makes the home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip and Ruth often had this sort of discussion, to which Philip was
      always trying to give a personal turn. He was now about to go to Ilium for
      the season, and he did not like to go without some assurance from Ruth
      that she might perhaps love him some day; when he was worthy of it, and
      when he could offer her something better than a partnership in his
      poverty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should work with a great deal better heart, Ruth,&rdquo; he said the morning
      he was taking leave, &ldquo;if I knew you cared for me a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth was looking down; the color came faintly to her cheeks, and she
      hesitated. She needn&rsquo;t be looking down, he thought, for she was ever so
      much shorter than tall Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not much of a place, Ilium,&rdquo; Philip went on, as if a little
      geographical remark would fit in here as well as anything else, &ldquo;and I
      shall have plenty of time to think over the responsibility I have taken,
      and&mdash;&rdquo; his observation did not seem to be coming out any where.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ruth looked up, and there was a light in her eyes that quickened
      Phil&rsquo;s pulse. She took his hand, and said with serious sweetness:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thee mustn&rsquo;t lose heart, Philip.&rdquo; And then she added, in another mood,
      &ldquo;Thee knows I graduate in the summer and shall have my diploma. And if any
      thing happens&mdash;mines explode sometimes&mdash;thee can send for me.
      Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The opening of the Ilium coal mine was begun with energy, but without many
      omens of success. Philip was running a tunnel into the breast of the
      mountain, in faith that the coal stratum ran there as it ought to. How far
      he must go in he believed he knew, but no one could tell exactly. Some of
      the miners said that they should probably go through the mountain, and
      that the hole could be used for a railway tunnel. The mining camp was a
      busy place at any rate. Quite a settlement of board and log shanties had
      gone up, with a blacksmith shop, a small machine shop, and a temporary
      store for supplying the wants of the workmen. Philip and Harry pitched a
      commodious tent, and lived in the full enjoyment of the free life.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no difficulty in digging a bole in the ground, if you have money
      enough to pay for the digging, but those who try this sort of work are
      always surprised at the large amount of money necessary to make a small
      hole. The earth is never willing to yield one product, hidden in her
      bosom, without an equivalent for it. And when a person asks of her coal,
      she is quite apt to require gold in exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was exciting work for all concerned in it. As the tunnel advanced into
      the rock every day promised to be the golden day. This very blast might
      disclose the treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work went on week after week, and at length during the night as well
      as the daytime. Gangs relieved each other, and the tunnel was every hour,
      inch by inch and foot by foot, crawling into the mountain. Philip was on
      the stretch of hope and excitement. Every pay day he saw his funds melting
      away, and still there was only the faintest show of what the miners call
      &ldquo;signs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The life suited Harry, whose buoyant hopefulness was never disturbed. He
      made endless calculations, which nobody could understand, of the probable
      position of the vein. He stood about among the workmen with the busiest
      air. When he was down at Ilium he called himself the engineer of the
      works, and he used to spend hours smoking his pipe with the Dutch landlord
      on the hotel porch, and astonishing the idlers there with the stories of
      his railroad operations in Missouri. He talked with the landlord, too,
      about enlarging his hotel, and about buying some village lots, in the
      prospect of a rise, when the mine was opened. He taught the Dutchman how
      to mix a great many cooling drinks for the summer time, and had a bill at
      the hotel, the growing length of which Mr. Dusenheimer contemplated with
      pleasant anticipations. Mr. Brierly was a very useful and cheering person
      wherever he went.

      Midsummer arrived: Philip could report to Mr. Bolton only progress, and
      this was not a cheerful message for him to send to Philadelphia in reply
      to inquiries that he thought became more and more anxious. Philip himself
      was a prey to the constant fear that the money would give out before the
      coal was struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Harry was summoned to New York, to attend the trial of Laura
      Hawkins. It was possible that Philip would have to go also, her lawyer
      wrote, but they hoped for a postponement. There was important evidence
      that they could not yet obtain, and he hoped the judge would not force
      them to a trial unprepared. There were many reasons for a delay, reasons
      which of course are never mentioned, but which it would seem that a New
      York judge sometimes must understand, when he grants a postponement upon a
      motion that seems to the public altogether inadequate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry went, but he soon came back. The trial was put off. Every week we
      can gain, said the learned counsel, Braham, improves our chances. The
      popular rage never lasts long.

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve struck it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the announcement at the tent door that woke Philip out of a sound
      sleep at dead of night, and shook all the sleepiness out of him in a
      trice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p444" id="p444"></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Where is it? When? Coal? Let me see it. What quality is it?&rdquo; were
      some of the rapid questions that Philip poured out as he hurriedly
      dressed. &ldquo;Harry, wake up, my boy, the coal train is coming. Struck it, eh?
      Let&rsquo;s see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foreman put down his lantern, and handed Philip a black lump. There
      was no mistake about it, it was the hard, shining anthracite, and its
      freshly fractured surface, glistened in the light like polished steel.
      Diamond never shone with such lustre in the eyes of Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was exuberant, but Philip&rsquo;s natural caution found expression in his
      next remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Roberts, you are sure about this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&mdash;sure that it&rsquo;s coal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, no, sure that it&rsquo;s the main vein.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes. We took it to be that&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you from the first?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say we did at first. No, we didn&rsquo;t. Most of the indications were
      there, but not all of them, not all of them. So we thought we&rsquo;d prospect a
      bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was tolerable thick, and looked as if it might be the vein&mdash;looked
      as if it ought to be the vein. Then we went down on it a little. Looked
      better all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When did you strike it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve been prospecting about four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, been sinking on it something over four hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you couldn&rsquo;t go down very far in four hours&mdash;could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s a good deal broke up, nothing but picking and gadding
      stuff.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it does look encouraging, sure enough&mdash;but then the lacking
      indications&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather we had them, Mr. Sterling, but I&rsquo;ve seen more than one good
      permanent mine struck without &lsquo;em in my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is encouraging too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there was the Union, the Alabama and the Black Mohawk&mdash;all
      good, sound mines, you know&mdash;all just exactly like this one when we
      first struck them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I begin to feel a good deal more easy. I guess we&rsquo;ve really got it.
      I remember hearing them tell about the Black Mohawk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m free to say that I believe it, and the men all think so too. They are
      all old hands at this business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come Harry, let&rsquo;s go up and look at it, just for the comfort of it,&rdquo; said
      Philip. They came back in the course of an hour, satisfied and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no more sleep for them that night. They lit their pipes, put a
      specimen of the coal on the table, and made it a kind of loadstone of
      thought and conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;there will have to be a branch track built, and
      a &lsquo;switch-back&rsquo; up the hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there will be no trouble about getting the money for that now. We
      could sell-out tomorrow for a handsome sum. That sort of coal doesn&rsquo;t go
      begging within a mile of a rail-road. I wonder if Mr. Bolton would rather
      sell out or work it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, work it,&rdquo; says Harry, &ldquo;probably the whole mountain is coal now you&rsquo;ve
      got to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly it might not be much of a vein after all,&rdquo; suggested Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Possibly it is; I&rsquo;ll bet it&rsquo;s forty feet thick. I told you. I knew the
      sort of thing as soon as I put my eyes on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip&rsquo;s next thought was to write to his friends and announce their good
      fortune. To Mr. Bolton he wrote a short, business letter, as calm as he
      could make it. They had found coal of excellent quality, but they could
      not yet tell with absolute certainty what the vein was. The prospecting
      was still going on. Philip also wrote to Ruth; but though this letter may
      have glowed, it was not with the heat of burning anthracite. He needed no
      artificial heat to warm his pen and kindle his ardor when he sat down to
      write to Ruth. But it must be confessed that the words never flowed so
      easily before, and he ran on for an hour disporting in all the
      extravagance of his imagination. When Ruth read it, she doubted if the
      fellow had not gone out of his senses. And it was not until she reached
      the postscript that she discovered the cause of the exhilaration. &ldquo;P. S.&mdash;We
      have found coal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The news couldn&rsquo;t have come to Mr. Bolton in better time. He had never
      been so sorely pressed. A dozen schemes which he had in hand, any one of
      which might turn up a fortune, all languished, and each needed just a
      little more money to save that which had been invested. He hadn&rsquo;t a piece
      of real estate that was not covered with mortgages, even to the wild tract
      which Philip was experimenting on, and which had, no marketable value
      above the incumbrance on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come home that day early, unusually dejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said to his wife, &ldquo;that we shall have to give up our
      house. I don&rsquo;t care for myself, but for thee and the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be the least of misfortunes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bolton, cheerfully, &ldquo;if
      thee can clear thyself from debt and anxiety, which is wearing thee out,
      we can live any where. Thee knows we were never happier than when we were
      in a much humbler home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, Margaret, that affair of Bigler and Small&rsquo;s has come on me
      just when I couldn&rsquo;t stand another ounce. They have made another failure
      of it. I might have known they would; and the sharpers, or fools, I don&rsquo;t
      know which, have contrived to involve me for three times as much as the
      first obligation. The security is in my hands, but it is good for nothing
      to me. I have not the money to do anything with the contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth heard this dismal news without great surprise. She had long felt that
      they were living on a volcano, that might go in to active operation at any
      hour. Inheriting from her father an active brain and the courage to
      undertake new things, she had little of his sanguine temperament which
      blinds one to difficulties and possible failures. She had little
      confidence in the many schemes which had been about to lift her father out
      of all his embarrassments and into great wealth, ever since she was a
      child; as she grew older, she rather wondered that they were as prosperous
      as they seemed to be, and that they did not all go to smash amid so many
      brilliant projects. She was nothing but a woman, and did not know how much
      of the business prosperity of the world is only a bubble of credit and
      speculation, one scheme helping to float another which is no better than
      it, and the whole liable to come to naught and confusion as soon as the
      busy brain that conceived them ceases its power to devise, or when some
      accident produces a sudden panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps, I shall be the stay of the family, yet,&rdquo; said Ruth, with an
      approach to gaiety; &ldquo;When we move into a little house in town, will thee
      let me put a little sign on the door: DR. RUTH BOLTON? Mrs. Dr.
      Longstreet, thee knows, has a great income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will pay for the sign, Ruth?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bolton.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant entered with the afternoon mail from the office. Mr. Bolton took
      his letters listlessly, dreading to open them. He knew well what they
      contained, new difficulties, more urgent demands for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here is one from Philip. Poor fellow. I shall feel his disappointment
      as much as my own bad luck. It is hard to bear when one is young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the letter and read. As he read his face lightened, and he
      fetched such a sigh of relief, that Mrs. Bolton and Ruth both exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read that,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Philip has found coal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The world was changed in a moment. One little sentence had done it. There
      was no more trouble. Philip had found coal. That meant relief. That meant
      fortune. A great weight was taken off, and the spirits of the whole
      household rose magically. Good Money! beautiful demon of Money, what an
      enchanter thou art! Ruth felt that she was of less consequence in the
      household, now that Philip had found Coal, and perhaps she was not sorry
      to feel so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bolton was ten years younger the next morning. He went into the city,
      and showed his letter on change. It was the sort of news his friends were
      quite willing to listen to. They took a new interest in him. If it was
      confirmed, Bolton would come right up again. There would be no difficulty
      about his getting all the money he wanted. The money market did not seem
      to be half so tight as it was the day before. Mr. Bolton spent a very
      pleasant day in his office, and went home revolving some new plans, and
      the execution of some projects he had long been prevented from entering
      upon by the lack of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day had been spent by Philip in no less excitement. By daylight, with
      Philip&rsquo;s letters to the mail, word had gone down to Ilium that coal had
      been found, and very early a crowd of eager spectators had come up to see
      for themselves.

    <p>
      The &ldquo;prospecting&rdquo; continued day and night for upwards of a week, and
      during the first four or five days the indications grew more and more
      promising, and the telegrams and letters kept Mr. Bolton duly posted. But
      at last a change came, and the promises began to fail with alarming
      rapidity. In the end it was demonstrated without the possibility of a
      doubt that the great &ldquo;find&rdquo; was nothing but a worthless seam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was cast down, all the more so because he had been so foolish as to
      send the news to Philadelphia before he knew what he was writing about.
      And now he must contradict it. &ldquo;It turns out to be only a mere seam,&rdquo; he
      wrote, &ldquo;but we look upon it as an indication of better further in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas! Mr. Bolton&rsquo;s affairs could not wait for &ldquo;indications.&rdquo; The future
      might have a great deal in store, but the present was black and hopeless.
      It was doubtful if any sacrifice could save him from ruin. Yet sacrifice
      he must make, and that instantly, in the hope of saving something from the
      wreck of his fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      His lovely country home must go. That would bring the most ready money.
      The house that he had built with loving thought for each one of his
      family, as he planned its luxurious apartments and adorned it; the grounds
      that he had laid out, with so much delight in following the tastes of his
      wife, with whom the country, the cultivation of rare trees and flowers,
      the care of garden and lawn and conservatories were a passion almost; this
      home, which he had hoped his children would enjoy long after he had done
      with it, must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family bore the sacrifice better than he did. They declared in fact&mdash;women
      are such hypocrites&mdash;that they quite enjoyed the city (it was in
      August) after living so long in the country, that it was a thousand times
      more convenient in every respect; Mrs. Bolton said it was a relief from
      the worry of a large establishment, and Ruth reminded her father that she
      should have had to come to town anyway before long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bolton was relieved, exactly as a water-logged ship is lightened by
      throwing overboard the most valuable portion of the cargo&mdash;but the
      leak was not stopped. Indeed his credit was injured instead of helped by
      the prudent step he had taken. It was regarded as a sure evidence of his
      embarrassment, and it was much more difficult for him to obtain help than
      if he had, instead of retrenching, launched into some new speculation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was greatly troubled, and exaggerated his own share in the bringing
      about of the calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not look at it so!&rdquo; Mr. Bolton wrote him. &ldquo;You have neither
      helped nor hindered&mdash;but you know you may help by and by. It would
      have all happened just so, if we had never begun to dig that hole. That is
      only a drop. Work away. I still have hope that something will occur to
      relieve me. At any rate we must not give up the mine, so long as we have
      any show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alas! the relief did not come. New misfortunes came instead. When the
      extent of the Bigler swindle was disclosed there was no more hope that Mr.
      Bolton could extricate himself, and he had, as an honest man, no resource
      except to surrender all his property for the benefit of his creditors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Autumn came and found Philip working with diminished force but still
      with hope. He had again and again been encouraged by good &ldquo;indications,&rdquo;
       but he had again and again been disappointed. He could not go on much
      longer, and almost everybody except himself had thought it was useless to
      go on as long as he had been doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the news came of Mr. Bolton&rsquo;s failure, of course the work stopped.
      The men were discharged, the tools were housed, the hopeful noise of
      pickman and driver ceased, and the mining camp had that desolate and
      mournful aspect which always hovers over a frustrated enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip sat down amid the ruins, and almost wished he were buried in them.
      How distant Ruth was now from him, now, when she might need him most. How
      changed was all the Philadelphia world, which had hitherto stood for the
      exemplification of happiness and prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He still had faith that there was coal in that mountain. He made a picture
      of himself living there a hermit in a shanty by the tunnel, digging away
      with solitary pick and wheelbarrow, day after day and year after year,
      until he grew gray and aged, and was known in all that region as the old
      man of the mountain. Perhaps some day&mdash;he felt it must be so some day&mdash;he
      should strike coal. But what if he did? Who would be alive to care for it
      then? What would he care for it then? No, a man wants riches in his youth,
      when the world is fresh to him. He wondered why Providence could not have
      reversed the usual process, and let the majority of men begin with wealth
      and gradually spend it, and die poor when they no longer needed it.

      Harry went back to the city. It was evident that his services were no
      longer needed. Indeed, he had letters from his uncle, which he did not
      read to Philip, desiring him to go to San Francisco to look after some
      government contracts in the harbor there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip had to look about him for something to do; he was like Adam; the
      world was all before him whereto choose. He made, before he went
      elsewhere, a somewhat painful visit to Philadelphia, painful but yet not
      without its sweetnesses. The family had never shown him so much affection
      before; they all seemed to think his disappointment of more importance
      than their own misfortune. And there was that in Ruth&rsquo;s manner&mdash;in
      what she gave him and what she withheld&mdash;that would have made a hero
      of a very much less promising character than Philip Sterling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the assets of the Bolton property, the Ilium tract was sold, and
      Philip bought it in at the vendue, for a song, for no one cared to even
      undertake the mortgage on it except himself. He went away the owner of it,
      and had ample time before he reached home in November, to calculate how
      much poorer he was by possessing it.

      It is impossible for the historian, with even the best intentions, to
      control events or compel the persons of his narrative to act wisely or to
      be successful. It is easy to see how things might have been better
      managed; a very little change here and there would have made a very
      different history of this one now in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Philip had adopted some regular profession, even some trade, he might
      now be a prosperous editor or a conscientious plumber, or an honest
      lawyer, and have borrowed money at the saving&rsquo;s bank and built a cottage,
      and be now furnishing it for the occupancy of Ruth and himself. Instead of
      this, with only a smattering of civil engineering, he is at his mother&rsquo;s
      house, fretting and fuming over his ill-luck, and the hardness and,
      dishonesty of men, and thinking of nothing but how to get the coal out of
      the Ilium hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Senator Dilworthy had not made that visit to Hawkeye, the Hawkins
      family and Col. Sellers would not now be dancing attendance upon Congress,
      and endeavoring to tempt that immaculate body into one of those
      appropriations, for the benefit of its members, which the members find it
      so difficult to explain to their constituents; and Laura would not be
      lying in the Tombs, awaiting her trial for murder, and doing her best, by
      the help of able counsel, to corrupt the pure fountain of criminal
      procedure in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Henry Brierly had been blown up on the first Mississippi steamboat he
      set foot on, as the chances were that he would be, he and Col. Sellers
      never would have gone into the Columbus Navigation scheme, and probably
      never into the East Tennessee Land scheme, and he would not now be
      detained in New York from very important business operations on the
      Pacific coast, for the sole purpose of giving evidence to convict of
      murder the only woman he ever loved half as much as he loves himself. If
      Mr. Bolton had said the little word &ldquo;no&rdquo; to Mr. Bigler, Alice Montague
      might now be spending the winter in Philadelphia, and Philip also (waiting
      to resume his mining operations in the spring); and Ruth would not be an
      assistant in a Philadelphia hospital, taxing her strength with arduous
      routine duties, day by day, in order to lighten a little the burdens that
      weigh upon her unfortunate family.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is altogether a bad business. An honest historian, who had progressed
      thus far, and traced everything to such a condition of disaster and
      suspension, might well be justified in ending his narrative and writing&mdash;&ldquo;after
      this the deluge.&rdquo; His only consolation would be in the reflection that he
      was not responsible for either characters or events.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the most annoying thought is that a little money, judiciously applied,
      would relieve the burdens and anxieties of most of these people; but
      affairs seem to be so arranged that money is most difficult to get when
      people need it most.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little of what Mr. Bolton has weakly given to unworthy people would now
      establish his family in a sort of comfort, and relieve Ruth of the
      excessive toil for which she inherited no adequate physical vigor. A
      little money would make a prince of Col. Sellers; and a little more would
      calm the anxiety of Washington Hawkins about Laura, for however the trial
      ended, he could feel sure of extricating her in the end. And if Philip had
      a little money he could unlock the stone door in the mountain whence would
      issue a stream of shining riches. It needs a golden wand to strike that
      rock. If the Knobs University bill could only go through, what a change
      would be wrought in the condition of most of the persons in this history.
      Even Philip himself would feel the good effects of it; for Harry would
      have something and Col. Sellers would have something; and have not both
      these cautious people expressed a determination to take an interest in the
      Ilium mine when they catch their larks?
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip could not resist the inclination to pay a visit to Fallkill. He had
      not been at the Montague&rsquo;s since the time he saw Ruth there, and he wanted
      to consult the Squire about an occupation. He was determined now to waste
      no more time in waiting on Providence, but to go to work at something, if
      it were nothing better, than teaching in the Fallkill Seminary, or digging
      clams on Hingham beach. Perhaps he could read law in Squire Montague&rsquo;s
      office while earning his bread as a teacher in the Seminary.

      It was not altogether Philip&rsquo;s fault, let us own, that he was in this
      position. There are many young men like him in American society, of his
      age, opportunities, education and abilities, who have really been educated
      for nothing and have let themselves drift, in the hope that they will find
      somehow, and by some sudden turn of good luck, the golden road to fortune.
      He was not idle or lazy, he had energy and a disposition to carve his own
      way. But he was born into a time when all young men of his age caught the
      fever of speculation, and expected to get on in the world by the omission
      of some of the regular processes which have been appointed from of old.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      And examples were not wanting to encourage him. He saw people, all around
      him, poor yesterday, rich to-day, who had come into sudden opulence by
      some means which they could not have classified among any of the regular
      occupations of life. A war would give such a fellow a career and very
      likely fame. He might have been a &ldquo;railroad man,&rdquo; or a politician, or a
      land speculator, or one of those mysterious people who travel free on all
      rail-roads and steamboats, and are continually crossing and recrossing the
      Atlantic, driven day and night about nobody knows what, and make a great
      deal of money by so doing. Probably, at last, he sometimes thought with a
      whimsical smile, he should end by being an insurance agent, and asking
      people to insure their lives for his benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly Philip did not think how much the attractions of Fallkill were
      increased by the presence of Alice there. He had known her so long, she
      had somehow grown into his life by habit, that he would expect the
      pleasure of her society without thinking much about it. Latterly he never
      thought of her without thinking of Ruth, and if he gave the subject any
      attention, it was probably in an undefined consciousness that, he had her
      sympathy in his love, and that she was always willing to hear him talk
      about it. If he ever wondered that Alice herself was not in love and never
      spoke of the possibility of her own marriage, it was a transient thought
      for love did not seem necessary, exactly, to one so calm and evenly
      balanced and with so many resources in her herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever her thoughts may have been they were unknown to Philip, as they
      are to these historians; if she was seeming to be what she was not, and
      carrying a burden heavier than any one else carried, because she had to
      bear it alone, she was only doing what thousands of women do, with a
      self-renunciation and heroism, of which men, impatient and complaining,
      have no conception. Have not these big babies with beards filled all
      literature with their outcries, their griefs and their lamentations? It is
      always the gentle sex which is hard and cruel and fickle and implacable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think you would be contented to live in Fallkill, and attend the
      county Court?&rdquo; asked Alice, when Philip had opened the budget of his new
      programme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not always,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;I might go and practice in Boston
      maybe, or go to Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or you might get elected to Congress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip looked at Alice to see if she was in earnest and not chaffing him.
      Her face was quite sober. Alice was one of those patriotic women in the
      rural districts, who think men are still selected for Congress on account
      of qualifications for the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Philip, &ldquo;the chances are that a man cannot get into congress
      now without resorting to arts and means that should render him unfit to go
      there; of course there are exceptions; but do you know that I could not go
      into politics if I were a lawyer, without losing standing somewhat in my
      profession, and without raising at least a suspicion of my intentions and
      unselfishness? Why, it is telegraphed all over the country and commented
      on as something wonderful if a congressman votes honestly and unselfishly
      and refuses to take advantage of his position to steal from the
      government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; insisted Alice, &ldquo;I should think it a noble ambition to go to
      congress, if it is so bad, and help reform it. I don&rsquo;t believe it is as
      corrupt as the English parliament used to be, if there is any truth in the
      novels, and I suppose that is reformed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know where the reform is to begin. I&rsquo;ve seen a perfectly
      capable, honest man, time and again, run against an illiterate trickster,
      and get beaten. I suppose if the people wanted decent members of congress
      they would elect them. Perhaps,&rdquo; continued Philip with a smile, &ldquo;the women
      will have to vote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I should be willing to, if it were a necessity, just as I would go
      to war and do what I could, if the country couldn&rsquo;t be saved otherwise,&rdquo;
       said Alice, with a spirit that surprised Philip, well as he thought he
      knew her. &ldquo;If I were a young gentleman in these times&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip laughed outright. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just what Ruth used to say, &lsquo;if she were a
      man.&rsquo; I wonder if all the young ladies are contemplating a change of sex.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, only a changed sex,&rdquo; retorted Alice; &ldquo;we contemplate for the most
      part young men who don&rsquo;t care for anything they ought to care for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Philip, looking humble, &ldquo;I care for some things, you and Ruth
      for instance; perhaps I ought not to. Perhaps I ought to care for Congress
      and that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a goose, Philip. I heard from Ruth yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see her letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed. But I am afraid her hard work is telling on her, together
      with her anxiety about her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think, Alice,&rdquo; asked Philip with one of those selfish thoughts
      that are not seldom mixed with real love, &ldquo;that Ruth prefers her
      profession to&mdash;to marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; exclaimed Alice, rising to quit the room, and speaking hurriedly
      as if the words were forced from her, &ldquo;you are as blind as a bat; Ruth
      would cut off her right hand for you this minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip never noticed that Alice&rsquo;s face was flushed and that her voice was
      unsteady; he only thought of the delicious words he had heard. And the
      poor girl, loyal to Ruth, loyal to Philip, went straight to her room,
      locked the door, threw herself on the bed and sobbed as if her heart would
      break. And then she prayed that her Father in Heaven would give her
      strength. And after a time she was calm again, and went to her bureau
      drawer and took from a hiding place a little piece of paper, yellow with
      age. Upon it was pinned a four-leaved clover, dry and yellow also. She
      looked long at this foolish memento. Under the clover leaf was written in
      a school-girl&rsquo;s hand&mdash;&ldquo;Philip, June, 186-.&rdquo;

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Montague thought very well of Philip&rsquo;s proposal. It would have been
      better if he had begun the study of the law as soon as he left college,
      but it was not too late now, and besides he had gathered some knowledge of
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked the Squire, &ldquo;do you mean to abandon your land in
      Pennsylvania?&rdquo; This track of land seemed an immense possible fortune to
      this New England lawyer-farmer. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t it good timber, and doesn&rsquo;t the
      railroad almost touch it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do anything with it now. Perhaps I can sometime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your reason for supposing that there is coal there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The opinion of the best geologist I could consult, my own observation of
      the country, and the little veins of it we found. I feel certain it is
      there. I shall find it some day. I know it. If I can only keep the land
      till I make money enough to try again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip took from his pocket a map of the anthracite coal region, and
      pointed out the position of the Ilium mountain which he had begun to
      tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it look like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly does,&rdquo; said the Squire, very much interested. It is not
      unusual for a quiet country gentleman to be more taken with such a venture
      than a speculator who, has had more experience in its uncertainty. It was
      astonishing how many New England clergymen, in the time of the petroleum
      excitement, took chances in oil. The Wall street brokers are said to do a
      good deal of small business for country clergymen, who are moved no doubt
      with the laudable desire of purifying the New York stock board.

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that there is much risk,&rdquo; said the Squire, at length. &ldquo;The
      timber is worth more than the mortgage; and if that coal seam does run
      there, it&rsquo;s a magnificent fortune. Would you like to try it again in the
      spring, Phil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like to try it! If he could have a little help, he would work himself,
      with pick and barrow, and live on a crust. Only give him one more chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is how it came about that the cautious old Squire Montague was
      drawn into this young fellow&rsquo;s speculation, and began to have his serene
      old age disturbed by anxieties and by the hope of a great stroke of luck.

      &ldquo;To be sure, I only care about it for the boy,&rdquo; he said. The Squire was
      like everybody else; sooner or later he must &ldquo;take a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is probably on account of the lack of enterprise in women that they are
      not so fond of stock speculations and mine ventures as men. It is only
      when woman becomes demoralized that she takes to any sort of gambling.
      Neither Alice nor Ruth were much elated with the prospect of Philip&rsquo;s
      renewal of his mining enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Philip was exultant. He wrote to Ruth as if his fortune were already
      made, and as if the clouds that lowered over the house of Bolton were
      already in the deep bosom of a coal mine buried. Towards spring he went to
      Philadelphia with his plans all matured for a new campaign. His enthusiasm
      was irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip has come, Philip has come,&rdquo; cried the children, as if some great
      good had again come into the household; and the refrain even sang itself
      over in Ruth&rsquo;s heart as she went the weary hospital rounds. Mr. Bolton
      felt more courage than he had had in months, at the sight of his manly
      face and the sound of his cheery voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth&rsquo;s course was vindicated now, and it certainly did not become Philip,
      who had nothing to offer but a future chance against the visible result of
      her determination and industry, to open an argument with her. Ruth was
      never more certain that she was right and that she was sufficient unto
      herself. She, may be, did not much heed the still small voice that sang in
      her maiden heart as she went about her work, and which lightened it and
      made it easy, &ldquo;Philip has come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad for father&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; she said to Philip, &ldquo;that thee has come. I
      can see that he depends greatly upon what thee can do. He thinks women
      won&rsquo;t hold out long,&rdquo; added Ruth with the smile that Philip never exactly
      understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And aren&rsquo;t you tired sometimes of the struggle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired? Yes, everybody is tired I suppose. But it is a glorious
      profession. And would you want me to be dependent, Philip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes, a little,&rdquo; said Philip, feeling his way towards what he wanted
      to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what, for instance, just now?&rdquo; asked Ruth, a little maliciously Philip
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, on&mdash;&rdquo; he couldn&rsquo;t quite say it, for it occurred to him that he
      was a poor stick for any body to lean on in the present state of his
      fortune, and that the woman before him was at least as independent as he
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean depend,&rdquo; he began again. &ldquo;But I love you, that&rsquo;s all. Am I
      nothing&mdash;to you?&rdquo; And Philip looked a little defiant, and as if he
      had said something that ought to brush away all the sophistries of
      obligation on either side, between man and woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps Ruth saw this. Perhaps she saw that her own theories of a certain
      equality of power, which ought to precede a union of two hearts, might be
      pushed too far. Perhaps she had felt sometimes her own weakness and the
      need after all of so dear a sympathy and so tender an interest confessed,
      as that which Philip could give. Whatever moved her&mdash;the riddle is as
      old as creation&mdash;she simply looked up to Philip and said in a low
      voice, &ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;
     </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And Philip clasping both her hands in his, and looking down into her eyes,
      which drank in all his tenderness with the thirst of a true woman&rsquo;s nature&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Philip, come out here,&rdquo; shouted young Eli, throwing the door wide
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ruth escaped away to her room, her heart singing again, and now as if
      it would burst for joy, &ldquo;Philip has come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night Philip received a dispatch from Harry&mdash;&ldquo;The trial begins

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      December 18&mdash;, found Washington Hawkins and Col. Sellers once more at
      the capitol of the nation, standing guard over the University bill. The
      former gentleman was despondent, the latter hopeful. Washington&rsquo;s distress
      of mind was chiefly on Laura&rsquo;s account. The court would soon sit to try
      her case, he said, and consequently a great deal of ready money would be
      needed in the engineering of it. The University bill was sure to pass this
      time, and that would make money plenty, but might not the help come too
      late? Congress had only just assembled, and delays were to be feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but you are more or less right,
      there. Now let&rsquo;s figure up a little on, the preliminaries. I think
      Congress always tries to do as near right as it can, according to its
      lights. A man can&rsquo;t ask any fairer than that. The first preliminary it
      always starts out on, is to clean itself, so to speak. It will arraign two
      or three dozen of its members, or maybe four or five dozen, for taking
      bribes to vote for this and that and the other bill last winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It goes up into the dozens, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes; in a free country likes ours, where any man can run for
      Congress and anybody can vote for him, you can&rsquo;t expect immortal purity
      all the time&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t in nature. Sixty or eighty or a hundred and
      fifty people are bound to get in who are not angels in disguise, as young
      Hicks the correspondent says; but still it is a very good average; very
      good indeed. As long as it averages as well as that, I think we can feel
      very well satisfied. Even in these days, when people growl so much and the
      newspapers are so out of patience, there is still a very respectable
      minority of honest men in Congress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why a respectable minority of honest men can&rsquo;t do any good, Colonel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes it can, too&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in many ways, many ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what are the ways?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it is a question that requires time; a body
      can&rsquo;t answer every question right off-hand. But it does do good. I am
      satisfied of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then; grant that it does good; go on with the preliminaries.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I am coming to. First, as I said, they will try a lot of
      members for taking money for votes. That will take four weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s like last year; and it is a sheer waste of the time for which
      the nation pays those men to work&mdash;that is what that is. And it
      pinches when a body&rsquo;s got a bill waiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A waste of time, to purify the fountain of public law? Well, I never
      heard anybody express an idea like that before. But if it were, it would
      still be the fault of the minority, for the majority don&rsquo;t institute these
      proceedings. There is where that minority becomes an obstruction&mdash;but
      still one can&rsquo;t say it is on the wrong side.&mdash;Well, after they have
      finished the bribery cases, they will take up cases of members who have
      bought their seats with money. That will take another four weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good; go on. You have accounted for two-thirds of the session.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next they will try each other for various smaller irregularities, like
      the sale of appointments to West Point cadetships, and that sort of thing&mdash;mere
      trifling pocket-money enterprises that might better be passed over in
      silence, perhaps, but then one of our Congresses can never rest easy till
      it has thoroughly purified itself of all blemishes&mdash;and that is a
      thing to be applauded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long does it take to disinfect itself of these minor impurities?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, about two weeks, generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Congress always lies helpless in quarantine ten weeks of a session.
      That&rsquo;s encouraging. Colonel, poor Laura will never get any benefit from
      our bill. Her trial will be over before Congress has half purified itself.&mdash;And
      doesn&rsquo;t it occur to you that by the time it has expelled all its impure
      members there may not be enough members left to do business legally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I did not say Congress would expel anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well won&rsquo;t it expel anybody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not necessarily. Did it last year? It never does. That would not be
      regular.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why waste all the session in that tomfoolery of trying members?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is usual; it is customary; the country requires it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the country is a fool, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no. The country thinks somebody is going to be expelled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when nobody is expelled, what does the country think then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By that time, the thing has strung out so long that the country is sick
      and tired of it and glad to have a change on any terms. But all that
      inquiry is not lost. It has a good moral effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who does it have a good moral effect on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. On foreign countries, I think. We have always
      been under the gaze of foreign countries. There is no country in the
      world, sir, that pursues corruption as inveterately as we do. There is no
      country in the world whose representatives try each other as much as ours
      do, or stick to it as long on a stretch. I think there is something great
      in being a model for the whole civilized world, Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean a model; you mean an example.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all the same; it&rsquo;s just the same thing. It shows that a man
      can&rsquo;t be corrupt in this country without sweating for it, I can tell you
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hang it, Colonel, you just said we never punish anybody for villainous
      practices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But good God we try them, don&rsquo;t we! Is it nothing to show a disposition
      to sift things and bring people to a strict account? I tell you it has its
      effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, bother the effect!&mdash;What is it they do do? How do they proceed?
      You know perfectly well&mdash;and it is all bosh, too. Come, now, how do
      they proceed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why they proceed right and regular&mdash;and it ain&rsquo;t bosh, Washington,
      it ain&rsquo;t bosh. They appoint a committee to investigate, and that committee
      hears evidence three weeks, and all the witnesses on one side swear that
      the accused took money or stock or something for his vote. Then the
      accused stands up and testifies that he may have done it, but he was
      receiving and handling a good deal of money at the time and he doesn&rsquo;t
      remember this particular circumstance&mdash;at least with sufficient
      distinctness to enable him to grasp it tangibly. So of course the thing is
      not proven&mdash;and that is what they say in the verdict. They don&rsquo;t
      acquit, they don&rsquo;t condemn. They just say, &lsquo;Charge not proven.&rsquo; It leaves
      the accused in a kind of a shaky condition before the country, it purifies
      Congress, it satisfies everybody, and it doesn&rsquo;t seriously hurt anybody.
      It has taken a long time to perfect our system, but it is the most
      admirable in the world, now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So one of those long stupid investigations always turns out in that lame
      silly way. Yes, you are correct. I thought maybe you viewed the matter
      differently from other people. Do you think a Congress of ours could
      convict the devil of anything if he were a member?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear boy, don&rsquo;t let these damaging delays prejudice you against
      Congress. Don&rsquo;t use such strong language; you talk like a newspaper.
      Congress has inflicted frightful punishments on its members&mdash;now you
      know that. When they tried Mr. Fairoaks, and a cloud of witnesses proved
      him to be&mdash;well, you know what they proved him to be&mdash;and his
      own testimony and his own confessions gave him the same character, what
      did Congress do then?&mdash;come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did Congress do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know what Congress did, Washington. Congress intimated plainly
      enough, that they considered him almost a stain upon their body; and
      without waiting ten days, hardly, to think the thing over, they rose up
      and hurled at him a resolution declaring that they disapproved of his
      conduct! Now you know that, Washington.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a terrific thing&mdash;there is no denying that. If he had been
      proven guilty of theft, arson, licentiousness, infanticide, and defiling
      graves, I believe they would have suspended him for two days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can depend on it, Washington. Congress is vindictive, Congress is
      savage, sir, when it gets waked up once. It will go to any length to
      vindicate its honor at such a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah well, we have talked the morning through, just as usual in these
      tiresome days of waiting, and we have reached the same old result; that is
      to say, we are no better off than when we began. The land bill is just as
      far away as ever, and the trial is closer at hand. Let&rsquo;s give up
      everything and die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die and leave the Duchess to fight it out all alone? Oh, no, that won&rsquo;t
      do. Come, now, don&rsquo;t talk so. It is all going to come out right. Now
      you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never will, Colonel, never in the world. Something tells me that. I
      get more tired and more despondent every day. I don&rsquo;t see any hope; life
      is only just a trouble. I am so miserable, these days!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel made Washington get up and walk the floor with him, arm in
      arm. The good old speculator wanted to comfort him, but he hardly knew how
      to go about it. He made many attempts, but they were lame; they lacked
      spirit; the words were encouraging; but they were only words&mdash;he
      could not get any heart into them. He could not always warm up, now, with
      the old Hawkeye fervor. By and by his lips trembled and his voice got
      unsteady. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give up the ship, my boy&mdash;don&rsquo;t do it. The wind&rsquo;s bound to
      fetch around and set in our favor. I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p470" id="p470"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p470.jpg (24K)" src="images/p470.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And the prospect was so cheerful that he wept. Then he blew a
      trumpet-blast that started the meshes of his handkerchief, and said in
      almost his breezy old-time way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord bless us, this is all nonsense! Night doesn&rsquo;t last always; day has
      got to break some time or other. Every silver lining has a cloud behind
      it, as the poet says; and that remark has always cheered me; though&mdash;I
      never could see any meaning to it. Everybody uses it, though, and
      everybody gets comfort out of it. I wish they would start something fresh.
      Come, now, let&rsquo;s cheer up; there&rsquo;s been as good fish in the sea as there
      are now. It shall never be said that Beriah Sellers&mdash; Come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the telegraph boy. The Colonel reached for the message and devoured
      its contents:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said it! Never give up the ship! The trial&rsquo;s postponed till February,
      and we&rsquo;ll save the child yet. Bless my life, what lawyers they have in
      New-York! Give them money to fight with and the ghost of an excuse, and
      they: would manage to postpone anything in this world, unless it might be
      the millennium or something like that. Now for work again my boy. The
      trial will last to the middle of March, sure; Congress ends the fourth of
      March. Within three days of the end of the session they will be done
      putting through the preliminaries then they will be ready for national
      business. Our bill will go through in forty-eight hours, then, and we&rsquo;ll
      telegraph a million dollars to the jury&mdash;to the lawyers, I mean&mdash;and
      the verdict of the jury will be &lsquo;Accidental murder resulting from
      justifiable insanity&rsquo;&mdash;or something to, that effect, something to
      that effect.&mdash;Everything is dead sure, now. Come, what is the matter?
      What are you wilting down like that, for? You mustn&rsquo;t be a girl, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Colonel, I am become so used to troubles, so used to failures,
      disappointments, hard luck of all kinds, that a little good news breaks me
      right down. Everything has been so hopeless that now I can&rsquo;t stand good
      news at all. It is too good to be true, anyway. Don&rsquo;t you see how our bad
      luck has worked on me? My hair is getting gray, and many nights I don&rsquo;t
      sleep at all. I wish it was all over and we could rest. I wish we could
      lie down and just forget everything, and let it all be just a dream that
      is done and can&rsquo;t come back to trouble us any more. I am so tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, poor child, don&rsquo;t talk like that-cheer up&mdash;there&rsquo;s daylight
      ahead. Don&rsquo;t give up. You&rsquo;ll have Laura again, and&mdash;Louise, and your
      mother, and oceans and oceans of money&mdash;and then you can go away,
      ever so far away somewhere, if you want to, and forget all about this
      infernal place. And by George I&rsquo;ll go with you! I&rsquo;ll go with you&mdash;now
      there&rsquo;s my word on it. Cheer up. I&rsquo;ll run out and tell the friends the
      news.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he wrung Washington&rsquo;s hand and was about to hurry away when his
      companion, in a burst of grateful admiration said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are the best soul and the noblest I ever knew, Colonel
      Sellers! and if the people only knew you as I do, you would not be tagging
      around here a nameless man&mdash;you would be in Congress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gladness died out of the Colonel&rsquo;s face, and he laid his hand upon
      Washington&rsquo;s shoulder and said gravely:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always been a friend of your family, Washington, and I think I
      have always tried to do right as between man and man, according to my
      lights. Now I don&rsquo;t think there has ever been anything in my conduct that
      should make you feel justified in saying a thing like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, then, and walked slowly out, leaving Washington abashed and
      somewhat bewildered. When Washington had presently got his thoughts into
      line again, he said to himself, &ldquo;Why, honestly, I only meant to compliment
      him&mdash;indeed I would not have hurt him for the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

      The weeks drifted by monotonously enough, now. The &ldquo;preliminaries&rdquo;
       continued to drag along in Congress, and life was a dull suspense to
      Sellers and Washington, a weary waiting which might have broken their
      hearts, maybe, but for the relieving change which they got out of an
      occasional visit to New York to see Laura. Standing guard in Washington or
      anywhere else is not an exciting business in time of peace, but standing
      guard was all that the two friends had to do; all that was needed of them
      was that they should be on hand and ready for any emergency that might
      come up. There was no work to do; that was all finished; this was but the
      second session of the last winter&rsquo;s Congress, and its action on the bill
      could have but one result&mdash;its passage. The house must do its work
      over again, of course, but the same membership was there to see that it
      did it.&mdash;The Senate was secure&mdash;Senator Dilworthy was able to
      put all doubts to rest on that head. Indeed it was no secret in Washington
      that a two-thirds vote in the Senate was ready and waiting to be cast for
      the University bill as soon as it should come before that body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington did not take part in the gaieties of &ldquo;the season,&rdquo; as he had
      done the previous winter. He had lost his interest in such things; he was
      oppressed with cares, now. Senator Dilworthy said to Washington that an
      humble deportment, under punishment, was best, and that there was but one
      way in which the troubled heart might find perfect repose and peace. The
      suggestion found a response in Washington&rsquo;s breast, and the Senator saw
      the sign of it in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment one could find the youth with the Senator even oftener
      than with Col. Sellers. When the statesman presided at great temperance
      meetings, he placed Washington in the front rank of impressive dignitaries
      that gave tone to the occasion and pomp to the platform. His bald headed
      surroundings made the youth the more conspicuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the statesman made remarks in these meetings, he not infrequently
      alluded with effect to the encouraging spectacle of one of the wealthiest
      and most brilliant young favorites of society forsaking the light vanities
      of that butterfly existence to nobly and self-sacrificingly devote his
      talents and his riches to the cause of saving his hapless fellow creatures
      from shame and misery here and eternal regret hereafter.

    <p>
      At the prayer meetings the Senator always brought Washington up the aisle
      on his arm and seated him prominently; in his prayers he referred to him
      in the cant terms which the Senator employed, perhaps unconsciously, and
      mistook, maybe, for religion, and in other ways brought him into notice.
      He had him out at gatherings for the benefit of the negro, gatherings for
      the benefit of the Indian, gatherings for the benefit of the heathen in
      distant lands. He had him out time and again, before Sunday Schools, as an
      example for emulation. Upon all these occasions the Senator made casual
      references to many benevolent enterprises which his ardent young friend
      was planning against the day when the passage of the University bill
      should make his means available for the amelioration of the condition of
      the unfortunate among his fellow men of all nations and all climes. Thus
      as the weeks rolled on Washington grew up into an imposing lion once more,
      but a lion that roamed the peaceful fields of religion and temperance, and
      revisited the glittering domain of fashion no more. A great moral
      influence was thus brought to bear in favor of the bill; the weightiest of
      friends flocked to its standard; its most energetic enemies said it was
      useless to fight longer; they had tacitly surrendered while as yet the day
      of battle was not come.

    <p>
      The session was drawing toward its close. Senator Dilworthy thought he
      would run out west and shake hands with his constituents and let them look
      at him. The legislature whose duty it would be to re-elect him to the
      United States Senate, was already in session. Mr. Dilworthy considered his
      re-election certain, but he was a careful, painstaking man, and if, by
      visiting his State he could find the opportunity to persuade a few more
      legislators to vote for him, he held the journey to be well worth taking.
      The University bill was safe, now; he could leave it without fear; it
      needed his presence and his watching no longer. But there was a person in
      his State legislature who did need watching&mdash;a person who, Senator
      Dilworthy said, was a narrow, grumbling, uncomfortable malcontent&mdash;a
      person who was stolidly opposed to reform, and progress and him,&mdash;a
      person who, he feared, had been bought with money to combat him, and
      through him the commonwealth&rsquo;s welfare and its politics&rsquo; purity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this person Noble,&rdquo; said Mr. Dilworthy, in a little speech at a dinner
      party given him by some of his admirers, &ldquo;merely desired to sacrifice me.&mdash;I
      would willingly offer up my political life on the altar of my dear State&rsquo;s
      weal, I would be glad and grateful to do it; but when he makes of me but a
      cloak to hide his deeper designs, when he proposes to strike through me at
      the heart of my beloved State, all the lion in me is roused&mdash;and I
      say, Here I stand, solitary and alone, but unflinching, unquailing, thrice
      armed with my sacred trust; and whoso passes, to do evil to this fair
      domain that looks to me for protection, must do so over my dead body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He further said that if this Noble were a pure man, and merely misguided,
      he could bear it, but that he should succeed in his wicked designs through
      a base use of money would leave a blot upon his State which would work
      untold evil to the morals of the people, and that he would not suffer; the
      public morals must not be contaminated. He would seek this man Noble; he
      would argue, he would persuade, he would appeal to his honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived on the ground he found his friends unterrified; they were
      standing firmly by him and were full of courage. Noble was working hard,
      too, but matters were against him, he was not making much progress. Mr.
      Dilworthy took an early opportunity to send for Mr. Noble; he had a
      midnight interview with him, and urged him to forsake his evil ways; he
      begged him to come again and again, which he did. He finally sent the man
      away at 3 o&rsquo;clock one morning; and when he was gone, Mr. Dilworthy said to
      himself,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel a good deal relieved, now, a great deal relieved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator now turned his attention to matters touching the souls of his
      people. He appeared in church; he took a leading part in prayer meetings;
      he met and encouraged the temperance societies; he graced the sewing
      circles of the ladies with his presence, and even took a needle now and
      then and made a stitch or two upon a calico shirt for some poor Bibleless
      pagan of the South Seas, and this act enchanted the ladies, who regarded
      the garments thus honored as in a manner sanctified. The Senator wrought
      in Bible classes, and nothing could keep him away from the Sunday Schools&mdash;neither
      sickness nor storms nor weariness. He even traveled a tedious thirty miles
      in a poor little rickety stagecoach to comply with the desire of the
      miserable hamlet of Cattleville that he would let its Sunday School look
      upon him.

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      All the town was assembled at the stage office when he arrived, two
      bonfires were burning, and a battery of anvils was popping exultant
      broadsides; for a United States Senator was a sort of god in the
      understanding of these people who never had seen any creature mightier
      than a county judge. To them a United States Senator was a vast, vague
      colossus, an awe inspiring unreality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day everybody was at the village church a full half hour before time
      for Sunday School to open; ranchmen and farmers had come with their
      families from five miles around, all eager to get a glimpse of the great
      man&mdash;the man who had been to Washington; the man who had seen the
      President of the United States, and had even talked with him; the man who
      had seen the actual Washington Monument&mdash;perhaps touched it with his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Senator arrived the Church was crowded, the windows were full,
      the aisles were packed, so was the vestibule, and so indeed was the yard
      in front of the building. As he worked his way through to the pulpit on
      the arm of the minister and followed by the envied officials of the
      village, every neck was stretched and, every eye twisted around
      intervening obstructions to get a glimpse. Elderly people directed each
      other&rsquo;s attention and, said, &ldquo;There! that&rsquo;s him, with the grand, noble
      forehead!&rdquo; Boys nudged each other and said, &ldquo;Hi, Johnny, here he is,
      there, that&rsquo;s him, with the peeled head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Senator took his seat in the pulpit, with the minister on one side of
      him and the Superintendent of the Sunday School on the other. The town
      dignitaries sat in an impressive row within the altar railings below. The
      Sunday School children occupied ten of the front benches dressed in their
      best and most uncomfortable clothes, and with hair combed and faces too
      clean to feel natural. So awed were they by the presence of a living
      United States Senator, that during three minutes not a &ldquo;spit ball&rdquo; was
      thrown. After that they began to come to themselves by degrees, and
      presently the spell was wholly gone and they were reciting verses and
      pulling hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual Sunday School exercises were hurried through, and then the
      minister, got up and bored the house with a speech built on the customary
      Sunday School plan; then the Superintendent put in his oar; then the town
      dignitaries had their say. They all made complimentary reference to &ldquo;their
      friend the Senator,&rdquo; and told what a great and illustrious man he was and
      what he had done for his country and for religion and temperance, and
      exhorted the little boys to be good and diligent and try to become like
      him some day. The speakers won the deathless hatred of the house by these
      delays, but at last there was an end and hope revived; inspiration was
      about to find utterance.

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dilworthy rose and beamed upon the assemblage for a full minute in
      silence. Then he smiled with an access of sweetness upon the children and
      began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My little friends&mdash;for I hope that all these bright-faced little
      people are my friends and will let me be their friend&mdash;my little
      friends, I have traveled much, I have been in many cities and many States,
      everywhere in our great and noble country, and by the blessing of
      Providence I have been permitted to see many gatherings like this&mdash;but
      I am proud, I am truly proud to say that I never have looked upon so much
      intelligence, so much grace, such sweetness of disposition as I see in the
      charming young countenances I see before me at this moment. I have been
      asking myself as I sat here, Where am I? Am I in some far-off monarchy,
      looking upon little princes and princesses? No. Am I in some populous
      centre of my own country, where the choicest children of the land have
      been selected and brought together as at a fair for a prize? No. Am I in
      some strange foreign clime where the children are marvels that we know not
      of? No. Then where am I? Yes&mdash;where am I? I am in a simple, remote,
      unpretending settlement of my own dear State, and these are the children
      of the noble and virtuous men who have made me what I am! My soul is lost
      in wonder at the thought! And I humbly thank Him to whom we are but as
      worms of the dust, that he has been pleased to call me to serve such men!
      Earth has no higher, no grander position for me. Let kings and emperors
      keep their tinsel crowns, I want them not; my heart is here!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again I thought, Is this a theatre? No. Is it a concert or a gilded
      opera? No. Is it some other vain, brilliant, beautiful temple of
      soul-staining amusement and hilarity? No. Then what is it? What did my
      consciousness reply? I ask you, my little friends, What did my
      consciousness reply? It replied, It is the temple of the Lord! Ah, think
      of that, now. I could hardly keep the tears back, I was so grateful. Oh,
      how beautiful it is to see these ranks of sunny little faces assembled
      here to learn the way of life; to learn to be good; to learn to be useful;
      to learn to be pious; to learn to be great and glorious men and women; to
      learn to be props and pillars of the State and shining lights in the
      councils and the households of the nation; to be bearers of the banner and
      soldiers of the cross in the rude campaigns of life, and raptured souls in
      the happy fields of Paradise hereafter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children, honor your parents and be grateful to them for providing for
      you the precious privileges of a Sunday School.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now my dear little friends, sit up straight and pretty&mdash;there,
      that&rsquo;s it&mdash;and give me your attention and let me tell you about a
      poor little Sunday School scholar I once knew.&mdash;He lived in the far
      west, and his parents were poor. They could not give him a costly
      education; but they were good and wise and they sent him to the Sunday
      School. He loved the Sunday School. I hope you love your Sunday School&mdash;ah,
      I see by your faces that you do! That is right!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this poor little boy was always in his place when the bell rang,
      and he always knew his lesson; for his teachers wanted him to learn and he
      loved his teachers dearly. Always love your teachers, my children, for
      they love you more than you can know, now. He would not let bad boys
      persuade him to go to play on Sunday. There was one little bad boy who was
      always trying to persuade him, but he never could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this poor little boy grew up to be a man, and had to go out in the
      world, far from home and friends to earn his living. Temptations lay all
      about him, and sometimes he was about to yield, but he would think of some
      precious lesson he learned in his Sunday School a long time ago, and that
      would save him. By and by he was elected to the legislature&mdash;Then he
      did everything he could for Sunday Schools. He got laws passed for them;
      he got Sunday Schools established wherever he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by and by the people made him governor&mdash;and he said it was all
      owing to the Sunday School.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a while the people elected him a Representative to the Congress of
      the United States, and he grew very famous.&mdash;Now temptations assailed
      him on every hand. People tried to get him to drink wine; to dance, to go
      to theatres; they even tried to buy his vote; but no, the memory of his
      Sunday School saved him from all harm; he remembered the fate of the bad
      little boy who used to try to get him to play on Sunday, and who grew up
      and became a drunkard and was hanged. He remembered that, and was glad he
      never yielded and played on Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, at last, what do you think happened? Why the people gave him a
      towering, illustrious position, a grand, imposing position. And what do
      you think it was? What should you say it was, children? It was Senator of
      the United States! That poor little boy that loved his Sunday School
      became that man. That man stands before you! All that he is, he owes to
      the Sunday School.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My precious children, love your parents, love your teachers, love your
      Sunday School, be pious, be obedient, be honest, be diligent, and then you
      will succeed in life and be honored of all men. Above all things, my
      children, be honest. Above all things be pure-minded as the snow. Let us
      join in prayer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Senator Dilworthy departed from Cattleville, he left three dozen boys
      behind him arranging a campaign of life whose objective point was the
      United States Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived at the State capital at midnight Mr. Noble came and held a
      three-hours&rsquo; conference with him, and then as he was about leaving said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked hard, and I&rsquo;ve got them at last. Six of them haven&rsquo;t got
      quite back-bone enough to slew around and come right out for you on the
      first ballot to-morrow; but they&rsquo;re going to vote against you on the first
      for the sake of appearances, and then come out for you all in a body on
      the second&mdash;I&rsquo;ve fixed all that! By supper time to-morrow you&rsquo;ll be
      re-elected. You can go to bed and sleep easy on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Mr. Noble was gone, the Senator said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to bring about a complexion of things like this was worth coming
      West for.&rdquo;

    </p>
    <p>
      The case of the State of New York against Laura Hawkins was finally set
      down for trial on the 15th day of February, less than a year after the
      shooting of George Selby.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the public had almost forgotten the existence of Laura and her crime,
      they were reminded of all the details of the murder by the newspapers,
      which for some days had been announcing the approaching trial. But they
      had not forgotten. The sex, the age, the beauty of the prisoner; her high
      social position in Washington, the unparalled calmness with which the
      crime was committed had all conspired to fix the event in the public mind,
      although nearly three hundred and sixty-five subsequent murders had
      occurred to vary the monotony of metropolitan life.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, the public read from time to time of the lovely prisoner, languishing
      in the city prison, the tortured victim of the law&rsquo;s delay; and as the
      months went by it was natural that the horror of her crime should become a
      little indistinct in memory, while the heroine of it should be invested
      with a sort of sentimental interest. Perhaps her counsel had calculated on
      this. Perhaps it was by their advice that Laura had interested herself in
      the unfortunate criminals who shared her prison confinement, and had done
      not a little to relieve, from her own purse, the necessities of some of
      the poor creatures. That she had done this, the public read in the
      journals of the day, and the simple announcement cast a softening light
      upon her character.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court room was crowded at an early hour, before the arrival of judges,
      lawyers and prisoner. There is no enjoyment so keen to certain minds as
      that of looking upon the slow torture of a human being on trial for life,
      except it be an execution; there is no display of human ingenuity, wit and
      power so fascinating as that made by trained lawyers in the trial of an
      important case, nowhere else is exhibited such subtlety, acumen, address,
      eloquence.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the conditions of intense excitement meet in a murder trial. The awful
      issue at stake gives significance to the lightest word or look. How the
      quick eyes of the spectators rove from the stolid jury to the keen
      lawyers, the impassive judge, the anxious prisoner. Nothing is lost of the
      sharp wrangle of the counsel on points of law, the measured decision&rsquo;s of
      the bench; the duels between the attorneys and the witnesses. The crowd
      sways with the rise and fall of the shifting testimony, in sympathetic
      interest, and hangs upon the dicta of the judge in breathless silence. It
      speedily takes sides for or against the accused, and recognizes as quickly
      its favorites among the lawyers. Nothing delights it more than the sharp
      retort of a witness and the discomfiture of an obnoxious attorney. A joke,
      even if it be a lame one, is no where so keenly relished or quickly
      applauded as in a murder trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the bar the young lawyers and the privileged hangers-on filled all
      the chairs except those reserved at the table for those engaged in the
      case. Without, the throng occupied all the seats, the window ledges and
      the standing room. The atmosphere was already something horrible. It was
      the peculiar odor of a criminal court, as if it were tainted by the
      presence, in different persons, of all the crimes that men and women can
      commit.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little stir when the Prosecuting Attorney, with two
      assistants, made his way in, seated himself at the table, and spread his
      papers before him. There was more stir when the counsel of the defense
      appeared. They were Mr. Braham, the senior, and Mr. Quiggle and Mr.
      O&rsquo;Keefe, the juniors.
    </p>

      Everybody in the court room knew Mr. Braham, the great criminal lawyer,
      and he was not unaware that he was the object of all eyes as he moved to
      his place, bowing to his friends in the bar. A large but rather spare man,
      with broad shoulders and a massive head, covered with chestnut curls which
      fell down upon his coat collar and which he had a habit of shaking as a
      lion is supposed to shake his mane. His face was clean shaven, and he had
      a wide mouth and rather small dark eyes, set quite too near together. Mr.
      Braham wore a brown frock coat buttoned across his breast, with a rose-bud
      in the upper buttonhole, and light pantaloons. A diamond stud was seen to
      flash from his bosom; and as he seated himself and drew off his gloves a
      heavy seal ring was displayed upon his white left hand. Mr. Braham having
      seated himself, deliberately surveyed the entire house, made a remark to
      one of his assistants, and then taking an ivory-handled knife from his
      pocket began to pare his finger nails, rocking his chair backwards and
      forwards slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later Judge O&rsquo;Shaunnessy entered at the rear door and took his
      seat in one of the chairs behind the bench; a gentleman in black
      broadcloth, with sandy hair, inclined to curl, a round, reddish and rather
      jovial face, sharp rather than intellectual, and with a self-sufficient
      air. His career had nothing remarkable in it. He was descended from a long
      line of Irish Kings, and he was the first one of them who had ever come
      into his kingdom&mdash;the kingdom of such being the city of New York. He
      had, in fact, descended so far and so low that he found himself, when a
      boy, a sort of street Arab in that city; but he had ambition and native
      shrewdness, and he speedily took to boot-polishing, and newspaper hawking,
      became the office and errand boy of a law firm, picked up knowledge enough
      to get some employment in police courts, was admitted to the bar, became a
      rising young politician, went to the legislature, and was finally elected
      to the bench which he now honored. In this democratic country he was
      obliged to conceal his royalty under a plebeian aspect. Judge O&rsquo;Shaunnessy
      never had a lucrative practice nor a large salary but he had prudently
      laid away money&mdash;believing that a dependant judge can never be
      impartial&mdash;and he had lands and houses to the value of three or four
      hundred thousand dollars. Had he not helped to build and furnish this very
      Court House? Did he not know that the very &ldquo;spittoon&rdquo; which his judgeship
      used cost the city the sum of one thousand dollars?

    <p>
      As soon as the judge was seated, the court was opened with the &ldquo;oi yis, oi
      yis&rdquo; of the officer in his native language, the case called, and the
      sheriff was directed to bring in the prisoner. In the midst of a profound
      hush Laura entered, leaning on the arm of the officer, and was conducted
      to a seat by her counsel. She was followed by her mother and by Washington
      Hawkins, who were given seats near her.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Laura was very pale, but this pallor heightened the lustre of her large
      eyes and gave a touching sadness to her expressive face. She was dressed
      in simple black, with exquisite taste, and without an ornament. The thin
      lace vail which partially covered her face did not so much conceal as
      heighten her beauty. She would not have entered a drawing room with more
      self-poise, nor a church with more haughty humility. There was in her
      manner or face neither shame nor boldness, and when she took her seat in
      full view of half the spectators, her eyes were downcast. A murmur of
      admiration ran through the room. The newspaper reporters made their
      pencils fly. Mr. Braham again swept his eyes over the house as if in
      approval. When Laura at length raised her eyes a little, she saw Philip
      and Harry within the bar, but she gave no token of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk then read the indictment, which was in the usual form. It
      charged Laura Hawkins, in effect, with the premeditated murder of George
      Selby, by shooting him with a pistol, with a revolver, shotgun, rifle,
      repeater, breech-loader, cannon, six-shooter, with a gun, or some other
      weapon; with killing him with a slung-shot, a bludgeon, carving knife,
      bowie knife, pen knife, rolling pin, car, hook, dagger, hair pin, with a
      hammer, with a screw-driver, with a nail, and with all other weapons and
      utensils whatsoever, at the Southern hotel and in all other hotels and
      places wheresoever, on the thirteenth day of March and all other days of
      the Christian era wheresoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura stood while the long indictment was read; and at the end, in
      response to the inquiry, of the judge, she said in a clear, low voice;
      &ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo; She sat down and the court proceeded to impanel a jury.

      The first man called was Michael Lanigan, saloon keeper.

    <p>
      He was about to be sworn, when the district attorney turning to him
      carelessly, remarked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Understand the nature of an oath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outside,&rdquo; said the man, pointing to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, do you know what an oath is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five cents,&rdquo; explained the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to insult me?&rdquo; roared the prosecuting officer. &ldquo;Are you an
      idiot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fresh baked. I&rsquo;m deefe. I don&rsquo;t hear a word you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man was discharged. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have made a bad juror, though,&rdquo;
       whispered Braham. &ldquo;I saw him looking at the prisoner sympathizingly.
      That&rsquo;s a point you want to watch for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The result of the whole day&rsquo;s work was the selection of only two jurors.
      These however were satisfactory to Mr. Braham. He had kept off all those
      he did not know. No one knew better than this great criminal lawyer that
      the battle was fought on the selection of the jury. The subsequent
      examination of witnesses, the eloquence expended on the jury are all for
      effect outside. At least that is the theory of Mr. Braham. But human
      nature is a queer thing, he admits; sometimes jurors are unaccountably
      swayed, be as careful as you can in choosing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was four weary days before this jury was made up, but when it was
      finally complete, it did great credit to the counsel for the defence. So
      far as Mr. Braham knew, only two could read, one of whom was the foreman,
      Mr. Braham&rsquo;s friend, the showy contractor. Low foreheads and heavy faces
      they all had; some had a look of animal cunning, while the most were only
      stupid. The entire panel formed that boasted heritage commonly described
      as the &ldquo;bulwark of our liberties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The District Attorney, Mr. McFlinn, opened the case for the state. He
      spoke with only the slightest accent, one that had been inherited but not
      cultivated. He contented himself with a brief statement of the case. The
      state would prove that Laura Hawkins, the prisoner at the bar, a fiend in
      the form of a beautiful woman, shot dead George Selby, a Southern
      gentleman, at the time and place described. That the murder was in cold
      blood, deliberate and without provocation; that it had been long
      premeditated and threatened; that she had followed the deceased from
      Washington to commit it. All this would be proved by unimpeachable
      witnesses. The attorney added that the duty of the jury, however painful
      it might be, would be plain and simple. They were citizens, husbands,
      perhaps fathers. They knew how insecure life had become in the metropolis.
      Tomorrow our own wives might be widows, their own children orphans, like
      the bereaved family in yonder hotel, deprived of husband and father by the
      jealous hand of some murderous female. The attorney sat down, and the
      clerk called?
    </p>
    <p>

    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Brierly took the stand. Requested by the District Attorney to tell
      the jury all he knew about the killing, he narrated the circumstances
      substantially as the reader already knows them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accompanied Miss Hawkins to New York at her request, supposing she was
      coming in relation to a bill then pending in Congress, to secure the
      attendance of absent members. Her note to him was here shown. She appeared
      to be very much excited at the Washington station. After she had asked the
      conductor several questions, he heard her say, &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t escape.&rdquo; Witness
      asked her &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; and she replied &ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo; Did not see her during the
      night. They traveled in a sleeping car. In the morning she appeared not to
      have slept, said she had a headache. In crossing the ferry she asked him
      about the shipping in sight; he pointed out where the Cunarders lay when
      in port. They took a cup of coffee that morning at a restaurant. She said
      she was anxious to reach the Southern Hotel where Mr. Simons, one of the
      absent members, was staying, before he went out. She was entirely
      self-possessed, and beyond unusual excitement did not act unnaturally.
      After she had fired twice at Col. Selby, she turned the pistol towards her
      own breast, and witness snatched it from her. She had been a great deal
      with Selby in Washington, appeared to be infatuated with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Cross-examined by Mr. Braham.) &ldquo;Mist-er.....er Brierly!&rdquo; (Mr. Braham had
      in perfection this lawyer&rsquo;s trick of annoying a witness, by drawling out
      the &ldquo;Mister,&rdquo; as if unable to recall the name, until the witness is
      sufficiently aggravated, and then suddenly, with a rising inflection,
      flinging his name at him with startling unexpectedness.) &ldquo;Mist-er.....er
      Brierly! What is your occupation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Civil Engineer, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, civil engineer, (with a glance at the jury). Following that
      occupation with Miss Hawkins?&rdquo; (Smiles by the jury).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said Harry, reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you known the prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two years, sir. I made her acquaintance in Hawkeye, Missouri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M.....m...m. Mist-er.....er Brierly! Were you not a lover of Miss
      Hawkins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Objected to. &ldquo;I submit, your Honor, that I have the right to establish the
      relation of this unwilling witness to the prisoner.&rdquo; Admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Harry hesitatingly, &ldquo;we were friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You act like a friend!&rdquo; (sarcastically.) The jury were beginning to hate
      this neatly dressed young sprig. &ldquo;Mister......er....Brierly! Didn&rsquo;t Miss
      Hawkins refuse you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry blushed and stammered and looked at the judge. &ldquo;You must answer,
      sir,&rdquo; said His Honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She&mdash;she&mdash;didn&rsquo;t accept me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I should think not. Brierly do you dare tell the jury that you had
      not an interest in the removal of your rival, Col. Selby?&rdquo; roared Mr.
      Braham in a voice of thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing like this, sir, nothing like this,&rdquo; protested the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Braham severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One word,&rdquo; said the District Attorney. &ldquo;Had you the least suspicion of
      the prisoner&rsquo;s intention, up to the moment of the shooting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least,&rdquo; answered Harry earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, of course not,&rdquo; nodded Mr. Braham to the jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prosecution then put upon the stand the other witnesses of the
      shooting at the hotel, and the clerk and the attending physicians. The
      fact of the homicide was clearly established. Nothing new was elicited,
      except from the clerk, in reply to a question by Mr. Braham, the fact that
      when the prisoner enquired for Col. Selby she appeared excited and there
      was a wild look in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dying deposition of Col. Selby was then produced. It set forth Laura&rsquo;s
      threats, but there was a significant addition to it, which the newspaper
      report did not have. It seemed that after the deposition was taken as
      reported, the Colonel was told for the first time by his physicians that
      his wounds were mortal. He appeared to be in great mental agony and fear;
      and said he had not finished his deposition. He added, with great
      difficulty and long pauses these words. &ldquo;I&mdash;have&mdash;not&mdash;told&mdash;all.
      I must tell&mdash;put&mdash;it&mdash;down&mdash;I&mdash;wronged&mdash;her.
      Years&mdash;ago&mdash;I&mdash;can&rsquo;t see&mdash;O&mdash;God&mdash;I&mdash;deserved&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       That was all. He fainted and did not revive again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Washington railway conductor testified that the prisoner had asked him
      if a gentleman and his family went out on the evening train, describing
      the persons he had since learned were Col. Selby and family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan Cullum, colored servant at Senator Dilworthy&rsquo;s, was sworn. Knew Col.
      Selby. Had seen him come to the house often, and be alone in the parlor
      with Miss Hawkins. He came the day but one before he was shot. She let him
      in. He appeared flustered like. She heard talking in the parlor, &lsquo;peared
      like it was quarrelin&rsquo;. Was afeared sumfin&rsquo; was wrong: Just put her ear to&mdash;the&mdash;keyhole
      of the back parlor-door. Heard a man&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;I&mdash;can&rsquo;t&mdash;I
      can&rsquo;t, Good God,&rdquo; quite beggin&rsquo; like. Heard&mdash;young Miss&rsquo; voice, &ldquo;Take
      your choice, then. If you &lsquo;bandon me, you knows what to &lsquo;spect.&rdquo; Then he
      rushes outen the house, I goes in&mdash;and I says, &ldquo;Missis did you ring?&rdquo;
       She was a standin&rsquo; like a tiger, her eyes flashin&rsquo;. I come right out.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the substance of Susan&rsquo;s testimony, which was not shaken in the
      least by severe cross-examination. In reply to Mr. Braham&rsquo;s question, if
      the prisoner did not look insane, Susan said, &ldquo;Lord; no, sir, just mad as
      a hawnet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington Hawkins was sworn. The pistol, identified by the officer as the
      one used in the homicide, was produced Washington admitted that it was
      his. She had asked him for it one morning, saying she thought she had
      heard burglars the night before. Admitted that he never had heard burglars
      in the house. Had anything unusual happened just before that? Nothing that
      he remembered. Did he accompany her to a reception at Mrs. Shoonmaker&rsquo;s a
      day or two before? Yes. What occurred? Little by little it was dragged out
      of the witness that Laura had behaved strangely there, appeared to be
      sick, and he had taken her home. Upon being pushed he admitted that she
      had afterwards confessed that she saw Selby there. And Washington
      volunteered the statement that Selby, was a black-hearted villain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The District Attorney said, with some annoyance; &ldquo;There&mdash;there! That
      will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The defence declined to examine Mr. Hawkins at present. The case for the
      prosecution was closed. Of the murder there could not be the least doubt,
      or that the prisoner followed the deceased to New York with a murderous
      intent. On the evidence the jury must convict, and might do so without
      leaving their seats. This was the condition of the case two days after the
      jury had been selected. A week had passed since the trial opened; and a
      Sunday had intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The public who read the reports of the evidence saw no chance for the
      prisoner&rsquo;s escape. The crowd of spectators who had watched the trial were
      moved with the most profound sympathy for Laura.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Braham opened the case for the defence. His manner was subdued, and he
      spoke in so low a voice that it was only by reason of perfect silence in
      the court room that he could be heard. He spoke very distinctly, however,
      and if his nationality could be discovered in his speech it was only in a
      certain richness and breadth of tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by saying that he trembled at the responsibility he had
      undertaken; and he should altogether despair, if he did not see before him
      a jury of twelve men of rare intelligence, whose acute minds would unravel
      all the sophistries of the prosecution, men with a sense of honor, which
      would revolt at the remorseless persecution of this hunted woman by the
      state, men with hearts to feel for the wrongs of which she was the victim.
      Far be it from him to cast any suspicion upon the motives of the able,
      eloquent and ingenious lawyers of the state; they act officially; their
      business is to convict. It is our business, gentlemen, to see that justice
      is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my duty, gentlemen, to unfold to you one of the most affecting
      dramas in all the history of misfortune. I shall have to show you a life,
      the sport of fate and circumstances, hurried along through shifting storm
      and sun, bright with trusting innocence and anon black with heartless
      villainy, a career which moves on in love and desertion and anguish,
      always hovered over by the dark spectre of INSANITY&mdash;an insanity
      hereditary and induced by mental torture,&mdash;until it ends, if end it
      must in your verdict, by one of those fearful accidents, which are
      inscrutable to men and of which God alone knows the secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I shall ask you to go with me away from this court room and
      its minions of the law, away from the scene of this tragedy, to a distant,
      I wish I could say a happier day. The story I have to tell is of a lovely
      little girl, with sunny hair and laughing eyes, traveling with her
      parents, evidently people of wealth and refinement, upon a Mississippi
      steamboat. There is an explosion, one of those terrible catastrophes which
      leave the imprint of an unsettled mind upon the survivors. Hundreds of
      mangled remains are sent into eternity. When the wreck is cleared away
      this sweet little girl is found among the panic stricken survivors in the
      midst of a scene of horror enough to turn the steadiest brain. Her parents
      have disappeared. Search even for their bodies is in vain. The bewildered,
      stricken child&mdash;who can say what changes the fearful event wrought in
      her tender brain&mdash;clings to the first person who shows her sympathy.
      It is Mrs. Hawkins, this good lady who is still her loving friend. Laura
      is adopted into the Hawkins family. Perhaps she forgets in time that she
      is not their child. She is an orphan. No, gentlemen, I will not deceive
      you, she is not an orphan. Worse than that. There comes another day of
      agony. She knows that her father lives. Who is he, where is he? Alas, I
      cannot tell you. Through the scenes of this painful history he flits here
      and there a lunatic! If he seeks his daughter, it is the purposeless
      search of a lunatic, as one who wanders bereft of reason, crying where is
      my child? Laura seeks her father. In vain just as she is about to find
      him, again and again-he disappears, he is gone, he vanishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But this is only the prologue to the tragedy. Bear with me while I relate
      it. (Mr. Braham takes out a handkerchief, unfolds it slowly; crashes it in
      his nervous hand, and throws it on the table). Laura grew up in her humble
      southern home, a beautiful creature, the joy of the house, the pride of
      the neighborhood, the loveliest flower in all the sunny south. She might
      yet have been happy; she was happy. But the destroyer came into this
      paradise. He plucked the sweetest bud that grew there, and having enjoyed
      its odor, trampled it in the mire beneath his feet. George Selby, the
      deceased, a handsome, accomplished Confederate Colonel, was this human
      fiend. He deceived her with a mock marriage; after some months he brutally
      abandoned her, and spurned her as if she were a contemptible thing; all
      the time he had a wife in New Orleans. Laura was crushed. For weeks, as I
      shall show you by the testimony of her adopted mother and brother, she
      hovered over death in delirium. Gentlemen, did she ever emerge from this
      delirium? I shall show you that when she recovered her health, her mind
      was changed, she was not what she had been. You can judge yourselves
      whether the tottering reason ever recovered its throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years pass. She is in Washington, apparently the happy favorite of a
      brilliant society. Her family have become enormously rich by one of those
      sudden turns in fortune that the inhabitants of America are familiar with&mdash;the
      discovery of immense mineral wealth in some wild lands owned by them. She
      is engaged in a vast philanthropic scheme for the benefit of the poor, by
      the use of this wealth. But, alas, even here and now, the same relentless
      fate pursued her. The villain Selby appears again upon the scene, as if on
      purpose to complete the ruin of her life. He appeared to taunt her with
      her dishonor, he threatened exposure if she did not become again the
      mistress of his passion. Gentlemen, do you wonder if this woman, thus
      pursued, lost her reason, was beside herself with fear, and that her
      wrongs preyed upon her mind until she was no longer responsible for her
      acts? I turn away my head as one who would not willingly look even upon
      the just vengeance of Heaven. (Mr. Braham paused as if overcome by his
      emotions. Mrs. Hawkins and Washington were in tears, as were many of the
      spectators also. The jury looked scared.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, in this condition of affairs it needed but a spark&mdash;I do
      not say a suggestion, I do not say a hint&mdash;from this butterfly
      Brierly; this rejected rival, to cause the explosion. I make no charges,
      but if this woman was in her right mind when she fled from Washington and
      reached this city in company&mdash;with Brierly, then I do not know what
      insanity is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Braham sat down, he felt that he had the jury with him. A burst
      of applause followed, which the officer promptly, suppressed. Laura, with
      tears in her eyes, turned a grateful look upon her counsel. All the women
      among the spectators saw the tears and wept also. They thought as they
      also looked at Mr. Braham, how handsome he is!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hawkins took the stand. She was somewhat confused to be the target of
      so many, eyes, but her honest and good face at once told in Laura&rsquo;s favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Hawkins,&rdquo; said Mr. Braham, &ldquo;will you&rsquo; be kind enough to state the
      circumstances of your finding Laura?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I object,&rdquo; said Mr. McFlinn; rising to his feet. &ldquo;This has nothing
      whatever to do with the case, your honor. I am surprised at it, even after
      the extraordinary speech of my learned friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you propose to connect it, Mr. Braham?&rdquo; asked the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it please the court,&rdquo; said Mr. Braham, rising impressively, &ldquo;your
      Honor has permitted the prosecution, and I have submitted without a word,
      to go into the most extraordinary testimony to establish a motive. Are we
      to be shut out from showing that the motive attributed to us could not by
      reason of certain mental conditions exist? I purpose, may, it please your
      Honor, to show the cause and the origin of an aberration of mind, to
      follow it up, with other like evidence, connecting it with the very moment
      of the homicide, showing a condition of the intellect, of the prisoner
      that precludes responsibility.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The State must insist upon its objections,&rdquo; said the District Attorney.
      &ldquo;The purpose evidently is to open the door to a mass of irrelevant
      testimony, the object of which is to produce an effect upon the jury your
      Honor well understands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested the judge, &ldquo;the court ought to hear the testimony,
      and exclude it afterwards, if it is irrelevant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your honor hear argument on that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And argument his honor did hear, or pretend to, for two whole days, from
      all the counsel in turn, in the course of which the lawyers read
      contradictory decisions enough to perfectly establish both sides, from
      volume after volume, whole libraries in fact, until no mortal man could
      say what the rules were. The question of insanity in all its legal aspects
      was of course drawn into the discussion, and its application affirmed and
      denied. The case was felt to turn upon the admission or rejection of this
      evidence. It was a sort of test trial of strength between the lawyers. At
      the end the judge decided to admit the testimony, as the judge usually
      does in such cases, after a sufficient waste of time in what are called
      arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hawkins was allowed to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <h2>
      <a name="ch56" id="ch56"></a>CHAPTER LVI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hawkins slowly and conscientiously, as if every detail of her family
      history was important, told the story of the steamboat explosion, of the
      finding and adoption of Laura. Silas, that is Mr. Hawkins, and she always
      loved Laura, as if she had been their own child.
    </p>
    <p>
      She then narrated the circumstances of Laura&rsquo;s supposed marriage, her
      abandonment and long illness, in a manner that touched all hearts. Laura
      had been a different woman since then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cross-examined. At the time of first finding Laura on the steamboat, did
      she notice that Laura&rsquo;s mind was at all deranged? She couldn&rsquo;t say that
      she did. After the recovery of Laura from her long illness, did Mrs.
      Hawkins think there were any signs of insanity about her? Witness
      confessed that she did not think of it then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Re-Direct examination. &ldquo;But she was different after that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington Hawkins corroborated his mother&rsquo;s testimony as to Laura&rsquo;s
      connection with Col. Selby. He was at Harding during the time of her
      living there with him. After Col. Selby&rsquo;s desertion she was almost dead,
      never appeared to know anything rightly for weeks. He added that he never
      saw such a scoundrel as Selby. (Checked by District attorney.) Had he
      noticed any change in Laura after her illness? Oh, yes. Whenever, any
      allusion was made that might recall Selby to mind, she looked awful&mdash;as
      if she could kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; said Mr. Braham, &ldquo;that there was an unnatural, insane gleam in
      her eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; said Washington in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was objected to by the district attorney, but it was got before
      the jury, and Mr. Braham did not care how much it was ruled out after
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beriah Sellers was the next witness called. The Colonel made his way to
      the stand with majestic, yet bland deliberation. Having taken the oath and
      kissed the Bible with a smack intended to show his great respect for that
      book, he bowed to his Honor with dignity, to the jury with familiarity,
      and then turned to the lawyers and stood in an attitude of superior
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sellers, I believe?&rdquo; began Mr. Braham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beriah Sellers, Missouri,&rdquo; was the courteous acknowledgment that the
      lawyer was correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sellers; you know the parties here, you are a friend of the family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know them all, from infancy, sir. It was me, sir, that induced Silas
      Hawkins, Judge Hawkins, to come to Missouri, and make his fortune. It was
      by my advice and in company with me, sir, that he went into the operation
      of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. Mr. Sellers, did you know a Major Lackland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew him, well, sir, knew him and honored him, sir. He was one of the
      most remarkable men of our country, sir. A member of congress. He was
      often at my mansion sir, for weeks. He used to say to me, &lsquo;Col. Sellers,
      if you would go into politics, if I had you for a colleague, we should
      show Calhoun and Webster that the brain of the country didn&rsquo;t lie east of
      the Alleganies. But I said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes. I believe Major Lackland is not living, Colonel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an almost imperceptible sense of pleasure betrayed in the
      Colonel&rsquo;s face at this prompt acknowledgment of his title.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless you, no. Died years ago, a miserable death, sir, a ruined man, a
      poor sot. He was suspected of selling his vote in Congress, and probably
      he did; the disgrace killed him, he was an outcast, sir, loathed by
      himself and by his constituents. And I think, sir&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge. &ldquo;You will confine yourself, Col. Sellers to the questions of
      the counsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, your honor. This,&rdquo; continued the Colonel in confidential
      explanation, &ldquo;was twenty years ago. I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought of referring
      to such a trifling circumstance now. If I remember rightly, sir&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A bundle of letters was here handed to the witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recognize, that hand-writing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if it was my own, sir. It&rsquo;s Major Lackland&rsquo;s. I was knowing to these
      letters when Judge Hawkins received them. [The Colonel&rsquo;s memory was a
      little at fault here. Mr. Hawkins had never gone into details with him on
      this subject.] He used to show them to me, and say, &lsquo;Col, Sellers you&rsquo;ve a
      mind to untangle this sort of thing.&rsquo; Lord, how everything comes back to
      me. Laura was a little thing then. &lsquo;The Judge and I were just laying our
      plans to buy the Pilot Knob, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Colonel, one moment. Your Honor, we put these letters in evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The letters were a portion of the correspondence of Major Lackland with
      Silas Hawkins; parts of them were missing and important letters were
      referred to that were not here. They related, as the reader knows, to
      Laura&rsquo;s father. Lackland had come upon the track of a man who was
      searching for a lost child in a Mississippi steamboat explosion years
      before. The man was lame in one leg, and appeared to be flitting from
      place to place. It seemed that Major Lackland got so close track of him
      that he was able to describe his personal appearance and learn his name.
      But the letter containing these particulars was lost. Once he heard of him
      at a hotel in Washington; but the man departed, leaving an empty trunk,
      the day before the major went there. There was something very mysterious
      in all his movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Sellers, continuing his testimony, said that he saw this lost letter,
      but could not now recall the name. Search for the supposed father had been
      continued by Lackland, Hawkins and himself for several years, but Laura
      was not informed of it till after the death of Hawkins, for fear of
      raising false hopes in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the District Attorney arose and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Honor, I must positively object to letting the witness wander off
      into all these irrelevant details.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Braham. &ldquo;I submit your honor, that we cannot be interrupted in this
      manner. We have suffered the state to have full swing. Now here is a
      witness, who has known the prisoner from infancy, and is competent to
      testify upon the one point vital to her safety. Evidently he is a
      gentleman of character, and his knowledge of the case cannot be shut out
      without increasing the aspect of persecution which the State&rsquo;s attitude
      towards the prisoner already has assumed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wrangle continued, waxing hotter and hotter. The Colonel seeing the
      attention of the counsel and Court entirely withdrawn from him, thought he
      perceived here his opportunity, turning and beaming upon the jury, he
      began simply to talk, but as the grandeur of his position grew upon him&mdash;his
      talk broadened unconsciously into an oratorical vein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see how she was situated, gentlemen; poor child, it might have broken
      her heart to let her mind get to running on such a thing as that. You see,
      from what we could make out her father was lame in the left leg and had a
      deep scar on his left forehead. And so ever since the day she found out
      she had another father, she never could run across a lame stranger without
      being taken all over with a shiver, and almost fainting where she stood.
      And the next minute she would go right after that man. Once she stumbled
      on a stranger with a game leg; and she was the most grateful thing in this
      world&mdash;but it was the wrong leg, and it was days and days before she
      could leave her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p507" id="p507"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p507.jpg (27K)" src="images/p507.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she found a man with a scar on his forehead and she was just going to
      throw herself into his arms, but he stepped out just then, and there
      wasn&rsquo;t anything the matter with his legs. Time and time again, gentlemen
      of the jury, has this poor suffering orphan flung herself on her knees
      with all her heart&rsquo;s gratitude in her eyes before some scarred and
      crippled veteran, but always, always to be disappointed, always to be
      plunged into new despair&mdash;if his legs were right his scar was wrong,
      if his scar was right his legs were wrong. Never could find a man that
      would fill the bill. Gentlemen of the jury; you have hearts, you have
      feelings, you have warm human sympathies; you can feel for this poor
      suffering child. Gentlemen of the jury, if I had time, if I had the
      opportunity, if I might be permitted to go on and tell you the thousands
      and thousands and thousands of mutilated strangers this poor girl has
      started out of cover, and hunted from city to city, from state to state,
      from continent to continent, till she has run them down and found they
      wan&rsquo;t the ones; I know your hearts&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the Colonel had become so warmed up, that his voice, had
      reached a pitch above that of the contending counsel; the lawyers suddenly
      stopped, and they and the Judge turned towards the Colonel and remained
      for several seconds too surprised at this novel exhibition to speak. In
      this interval of silence, an appreciation of the situation gradually stole
      over the audience, and an explosion of laughter followed, in which even
      the Court and the bar could hardly keep from joining.

    <p>
      The Judge. &ldquo;The witness will confine his remarks to answers to questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel turned courteously to the Judge and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, your Honor&mdash;certainly. I am not well acquainted with the
      forms of procedure in the courts of New York, but in the West, sir, in the
      West&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge. &ldquo;There, there, that will do, that will do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, your Honor, there were no questions asked me, and I thought I
      would take advantage of the lull in the proceedings to explain to the jury
      a very significant train of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Judge. &ldquo;That will DO sir! Proceed Mr. Braham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Col. Sellers, have you any reason to suppose that this man is still
      living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every reason, sir, every reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;State why&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never heard of his death, sir. It has never come to my knowledge.
      In fact, sir, as I once said to Governor&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you state to the jury what has been the effect of the knowledge of
      this wandering and evidently unsettled being, supposed to be her father,
      upon the mind of Miss Hawkins for so many years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Question objected to. Question ruled out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cross-examined. &ldquo;Major Sellers, what is your occupation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel looked about him loftily, as if casting in his mind what would
      be the proper occupation of a person of such multifarious interests and
      then said with dignity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gentleman, sir. My father used to always say, sir&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capt. Sellers, did you ever see this man, this supposed father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Sir. But upon one occasion, old Senator Thompson said to me, its my
      opinion, Colonel Sellers&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see any body who had seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir: It was reported around at one time, that&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The defense then spent a day in the examination of medical experts in
      insanity who testified, on the evidence heard, that sufficient causes had
      occurred to produce an insane mind in the prisoner. Numerous cases were
      cited to sustain this opinion. There was such a thing as momentary
      insanity, in which the person, otherwise rational to all appearances, was
      for the time actually bereft of reason, and not responsible for his acts.
      The causes of this momentary possession could often be found in the
      person&rsquo;s life. [It afterwards came out that the chief expert for the
      defense, was paid a thousand dollars for looking into the case.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The prosecution consumed another day in the examination of experts
      refuting the notion of insanity. These causes might have produced
      insanity, but there was no evidence that they have produced it in this
      case, or that the prisoner was not at the time of the commission of the
      crime in full possession of her ordinary faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial had now lasted two weeks. It required four days now for the
      lawyers to &ldquo;sum up.&rdquo; These arguments of the counsel were very important to
      their friends, and greatly enhanced their reputation at the bar but they
      have small interest to us. Mr. Braham in his closing speech surpassed
      himself; his effort is still remembered as the greatest in the criminal
      annals of New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Braham re-drew for the jury the picture of Laura&rsquo;s early life; he
      dwelt long upon that painful episode of the pretended marriage and the
      desertion. Col. Selby, he said, belonged, gentlemen; to what is called the
      &ldquo;upper classes.&rdquo; It is the privilege of the &ldquo;upper classes&rdquo; to prey upon
      the sons and daughters of the people. The Hawkins family, though allied to
      the best blood of the South, were at the time in humble circumstances. He
      commented upon her parentage. Perhaps her agonized father, in his
      intervals of sanity, was still searching for his lost daughter. Would he
      one day hear that she had died a felon&rsquo;s death? Society had pursued her,
      fate had pursued her, and in a moment of delirium she had turned and
      defied fate and society. He dwelt upon the admission of base wrong in Col.
      Selby&rsquo;s dying statement. He drew a vivid picture of the villain at last
      overtaken by the vengeance of Heaven. Would the jury say that this
      retributive justice, inflicted by an outraged, and deluded woman, rendered
      irrational by the most cruel wrongs, was in the nature of a foul,
      premeditated murder? &ldquo;Gentlemen; it is enough for me to look upon the life
      of this most beautiful and accomplished of her sex, blasted by the
      heartless villainy of man, without seeing, at the end of it; the horrible
      spectacle of a gibbet. Gentlemen, we are all human, we have all sinned, we
      all have need of mercy. But I do not ask mercy of you who are the
      guardians of society and of the poor waifs, its sometimes wronged victims;
      I ask only that justice which you and I shall need in that last, dreadful
      hour, when death will be robbed of half its terrors if we can reflect that
      we have never wronged a human being. Gentlemen, the life of this lovely
      and once happy girl, this now stricken woman, is in your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The jury were visibly affected. Half the court room was in tears. If a
      vote of both spectators and jury could have been taken then, the verdict
      would have been, &ldquo;let her go, she has suffered enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the district attorney had the closing argument. Calmly and without
      malice or excitement he reviewed the testimony. As the cold facts were
      unrolled, fear settled upon the listeners. There was no escape from the
      murder or its premeditation. Laura&rsquo;s character as a lobbyist in Washington
      which had been made to appear incidentally in the evidence was also
      against her: the whole body of the testimony of the defense was shown to
      be irrelevant, introduced only to excite sympathy, and not giving a color
      of probability to the absurd supposition of insanity. The attorney then
      dwelt upon the insecurity of life in the city, and the growing immunity
      with which women committed murders. Mr. McFlinn made a very able speech;
      convincing the reason without touching the feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge in his charge reviewed the testimony with great show of
      impartiality. He ended by saying that the verdict must be acquittal or
      murder in the first degree. If you find that the prisoner committed a
      homicide, in possession of her reason and with premeditation, your verdict
      will be accordingly. If you find she was not in her right mind, that she
      was the victim of insanity, hereditary or momentary, as it has been
      explained, your verdict will take that into account.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Judge finished his charge, the spectators anxiously watched the
      faces of the jury. It was not a remunerative study. In the court room the
      general feeling was in favor of Laura, but whether this feeling extended
      to the jury, their stolid faces did not reveal. The public outside hoped
      for a conviction, as it always does; it wanted an example; the newspapers
      trusted the jury would have the courage to do its duty. When Laura was
      convicted, then the public would turn around and abuse the governor if he
      did not pardon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jury went out. Mr. Braham preserved his serene confidence, but Laura&rsquo;s
      friends were dispirited. Washington and Col. Sellers had been obliged to
      go to Washington, and they had departed under the unspoken fear the
      verdict would be unfavorable, a disagreement was the best they could hope
      for, and money was needed. The necessity of the passage of the University
      bill was now imperative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Court waited for some time, but the jury gave no signs of coming in.
      Mr. Braham said it was extraordinary. The Court then took a recess for a
      couple of hours. Upon again coming in, word was brought that the jury had
      not yet agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the jury had a question. The point upon which they wanted instruction
      was this. They wanted to know if Col. Sellers was related to the Hawkins
      family. The court then adjourned till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Braham, who was in something of a pet, remarked to Mr. O&rsquo;Toole that
      they must have been deceived&mdash;that juryman with the broken nose could
      read!

      <a name="ch57" id="ch57"></a>CHAPTER LVII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The momentous day was at hand&mdash;a day that promised to make or mar the
      fortunes of Hawkins family for all time. Washington Hawkins and Col.
      Sellers were both up early, for neither of them could sleep. Congress was
      expiring, and was passing bill after bill as if they were gasps and each
      likely to be its last. The University was on file for its third reading
      this day, and to-morrow Washington would be a millionaire and Sellers no
      longer, impecunious but this day, also, or at farthest the next, the jury
      in Laura&rsquo;s Case would come to a decision of some kind or other&mdash;they
      would find her guilty, Washington secretly feared, and then the care and
      the trouble would all come back again, and these would be wearing months
      of besieging judges for new trials; on this day, also, the re-election of
      Mr. Dilworthy to the Senate would take place. So Washington&rsquo;s mind was in
      a state of turmoil; there were more interests at stake than it could
      handle with serenity. He exulted when he thought of his millions; he was
      filled with dread when he thought of Laura. But Sellers was excited and
      happy. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything is going right, everything&rsquo;s going perfectly right. Pretty
      soon the telegrams will begin to rattle in, and then you&rsquo;ll see, my boy.
      Let the jury do what they please; what difference is it going to make?
      To-morrow we can send a million to New York and set the lawyers at work on
      the judges; bless your heart they will go before judge after judge and
      exhort and beseech and pray and shed tears. They always do; and they
      always win, too. And they will win this time. They will get a writ of
      habeas corpus, and a stay of proceedings, and a supersedeas, and a new
      trial and a nolle prosequi, and there you are! That&rsquo;s the routine, and
      it&rsquo;s no trick at all to a New York lawyer. That&rsquo;s the regular routine&mdash;everything&rsquo;s
      red tape and routine in the law, you see; it&rsquo;s all Greek to you, of
      course, but to a man who is acquainted with those things it&rsquo;s mere&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      explain it to you sometime. Everything&rsquo;s going to glide right along easy
      and comfortable now. You&rsquo;ll see, Washington, you&rsquo;ll see how it will be.
      And then, let me think ..... Dilwortby will be elected to-day, and by day,
      after to-morrow night he will be in New York ready to put in his shovel&mdash;and
      you haven&rsquo;t lived in Washington all this time not to know that the people
      who walk right by a Senator whose term is up without hardly seeing him
      will be down at the deepo to say &lsquo;Welcome back and God bless you; Senator,
      I&rsquo;m glad to see you, sir!&rsquo; when he comes along back re-elected, you know.
      Well, you see, his influence was naturally running low when he left here,
      but now he has got a new six-years&rsquo; start, and his suggestions will simply
      just weigh a couple of tons a-piece day after tomorrow. Lord bless you he
      could rattle through that habeas corpus and supersedeas and all those
      things for Laura all by himself if he wanted to, when he gets back.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that,&rdquo; said Washington, brightening, &ldquo;but it is so. A
      newly-elected Senator is a power, I know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes indeed he is.&mdash;Why it, is just human nature. Look at me. When we
      first came here, I was Mr. Sellers, and Major Sellers, Captain Sellers,
      but nobody could ever get it right, somehow; but the minute our bill went,
      through the House, I was Col. Sellers every time. And nobody could do
      enough for me, and whatever I said was wonderful, Sir, it was always
      wonderful; I never seemed to say any flat things at all. It was Colonel,
      won&rsquo;t you come and dine with us; and Colonel why don&rsquo;t we ever see you at
      our house; and the Colonel says this; and the Colonel says that; and we
      know such-and-such is so-and-so because my husband heard Col. Sellers say
      so. Don&rsquo;t you see? Well, the Senate adjourned and left our bill high, and
      dry, and I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I warn&rsquo;t Old Sellers from that day, till our
      bill passed the House again last week. Now I&rsquo;m the Colonel again; and if I
      were to eat all the dinners I am invited to, I reckon I&rsquo;d wear my teeth
      down level with my gums in a couple of weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I do wonder what you will be to-morrow; Colonel, after the President
      signs the bill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General, sir?&mdash;General, without a doubt. Yes, sir, tomorrow it will
      be General, let me congratulate you, sir; General, you&rsquo;ve done a great
      work, sir;&mdash;you&rsquo;ve done a great work for the niggro; Gentlemen allow
      me the honor to introduce my friend General Sellers, the humane friend of
      the niggro. Lord bless me; you&rsquo;ll&rsquo; see the newspapers say, General Sellers
      and servants arrived in the city last night and is stopping at the Fifth
      Avenue; and General Sellers has accepted a reception and banquet by the
      Cosmopolitan Club; you&rsquo;ll see the General&rsquo;s opinions quoted, too&mdash;and
      what the General has to say about the propriety of a new trial and a
      habeas corpus for the unfortunate Miss Hawkins will not be without weight
      in influential quarters, I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I want to be the first to shake your faithful old hand and salute you
      with your new honors, and I want to do it now&mdash;General!&rdquo; said
      Washington, suiting the action to the word, and accompanying it with all
      the meaning that a cordial grasp and eloquent eyes could give it.

      The Colonel was touched; he was pleased and proud, too; his face answered
      for that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not very long after breakfast the telegrams began to arrive. The first was
      from Braham, and ran thus:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We feel certain that the verdict will be rendered to-day. Be it good or
        bad, let it find us ready to make the next move instantly, whatever it
        may be.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the right talk,&rdquo; said Sellers. &ldquo;That Braham&rsquo;s a wonderful man. He
      was the only man there that really understood me; he told me so himself,
      afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next telegram was from Mr. Dilworthy:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have not only brought over the Great Invincible, but through him a
        dozen more of the opposition. Shall be re-elected to-day by an
        overwhelming majority.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good again!&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;That man&rsquo;s talent for organization is
      something marvelous. He wanted me to go out there and engineer that thing,
      but I said, No, Dilworthy, I must be on hand here,&mdash;both on Laura&rsquo;s
      account and the bill&rsquo;s&mdash;but you&rsquo;ve no trifling genius for
      organization yourself, said I&mdash;and I was right. You go ahead, said I&mdash;you
      can fix it&mdash;and so he has. But I claim no credit for that&mdash;if I
      stiffened up his back-bone a little, I simply put him in the way to make
      his fight&mdash;didn&rsquo;t undertake it myself. He has captured Noble&mdash;.
      I consider that a splendid piece of diplomacy&mdash;Splendid, Sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By and by came another dispatch from New York:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Jury still out. Laura calm and firm as a statue. The report that the
        jury have brought her in guilty is false and premature.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Premature!&rdquo; gasped Washington, turning white. &ldquo;Then they all expect that
      sort of a verdict, when it comes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so did he; but he had not had courage enough to put it into words. He
      had been preparing himself for the worst, but after all his preparation
      the bare suggestion of the possibility of such a verdict struck him cold
      as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friends grew impatient, now; the telegrams did not come fast enough:
      even the lightning could not keep up with their anxieties. They walked the
      floor talking disjointedly and listening for the door-bell. Telegram after
      telegram came. Still no result. By and by there was one which contained a
      single line:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Court now coming in after brief recess to hear verdict. Jury ready.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wish they would finish!&rdquo; said Washington. &ldquo;This suspense is killing
      me by inches!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came another telegram:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Another hitch somewhere. Jury want a little more time and further
        instructions.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, well, this is trying,&rdquo; said the Colonel. And after a pause,
      &ldquo;No dispatch from Dilworthy for two hours, now. Even a dispatch from him
      would be better than nothing, just to vary this thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They waited twenty minutes. It seemed twenty hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Washington. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait for the telegraph boy to come all
      the way up here. Let&rsquo;s go down to Newspaper Row&mdash;meet him on the
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While they were passing along the Avenue, they saw someone putting up a
      great display-sheet on the bulletin board of a newspaper office, and an
      eager crowd of men was collecting abort the place. Washington and the
      Colonel ran to the spot and read this:

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tremendous Sensation! Startling news from Saint&rsquo;s Rest! On first ballot
        for U. S. Senator, when voting was about to begin, Mr. Noble rose in his
        place and drew forth a package, walked forward and laid it on the
        Speaker&rsquo;s desk, saying, &lsquo;This contains $7,000 in bank bills and was
        given me by Senator Dilworthy in his bed-chamber at midnight last night
        to buy&mdash;my vote for him&mdash;I wish the Speaker to count the money
        and retain it to pay the expense of prosecuting this infamous traitor
        for bribery. The whole legislature was stricken speechless with dismay
        and astonishment. Noble further said that there were fifty members
        present with money in their pockets, placed there by Dilworthy to buy
        their votes. Amidst unparalleled excitement the ballot was now taken,

      &ldquo;Good heavens and earth!&rdquo; exclaimed the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Capitol!&rdquo; said Washington. &ldquo;Fly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they did fly. Long before they got there the newsboys were running
      ahead of them with Extras, hot from the press, announcing the astounding
      news.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived in the gallery of the Senate, the friends saw a curious spectacle&mdash;every
      Senator held an Extra in his hand and looked as interested as if it
      contained news of the destruction of the earth. Not a single member was
      paying the least attention to the business of the hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Secretary, in a loud voice, was just beginning to read the title of a
      bill:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;House-Bill&mdash;No. 4,231,&mdash;An-Act-to-Found-and-Incorporate-the
      Knobs-Industrial-University! &mdash;Read-first-and-second-time-considered-in-committee-of-the-whole-ordered-engrossed
      and-passed-to-third-reading-and-final passage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The President&mdash;&ldquo;Third reading of the bill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two friends shook in their shoes. Senators threw down their extras and
      snatched a word or two with each other in whispers. Then the gavel rapped
      to command silence while the names were called on the ayes and nays.
      Washington grew paler and paler, weaker and weaker while the lagging list
      progressed; and when it was finished, his head fell helplessly forward on
      his arms. The fight was fought, the long struggle was over, and he was a
      pauper. Not a man had voted for the bill!
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Sellers was bewildered and well nigh paralyzed, himself. But no man
      could long consider his own troubles in the presence of such suffering as
      Washington&rsquo;s. He got him up and supported him&mdash;almost carried him
      indeed&mdash;out of the building and into a carriage. All the way home
      Washington lay with his face against the Colonel&rsquo;s shoulder and merely
      groaned and wept. The Colonel tried as well as he could under the dreary
      circumstances to hearten him a little, but it was of no use. Washington
      was past all hope of cheer, now. He only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is all over&mdash;it is all over for good, Colonel. We must beg
      our bread, now. We never can get up again. It was our last chance, and it
      is gone. They will hang Laura! My God they will hang her! Nothing can save
      the poor girl now. Oh, I wish with all my soul they would hang me
      instead!&rdquo;

      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at home, Washington fell into a chair and buried his face in his
      hands and gave full way to his misery. The Colonel did not know where to
      turn nor what to do. The servant maid knocked at the door and passed in a
      telegram, saying it had come while they were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel tore it open and read with the voice of a man-of-war&rsquo;s
      broadside:

    </h2>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The court room was packed on the morning on which the verdict of the jury
      was expected, as it had been every day of the trial, and by the same
      spectators, who had followed its progress with such intense interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a delicious moment of excitement which the frequenter of trials
      well knows, and which he would not miss for the world. It is that instant
      when the foreman of the jury stands up to give the verdict, and before he
      has opened his fateful lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court assembled and waited. It was an obstinate jury.
    </p>
    <p>
      It even had another question&mdash;this intelligent jury&mdash;to ask the
      judge this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was this: &ldquo;Were the doctors clear that the deceased had no
      disease which might soon have carried him off, if he had not been shot?&rdquo;
       There was evidently one jury man who didn&rsquo;t want to waste life, and was
      willing to stake a general average, as the jury always does in a civil
      case, deciding not according to the evidence but reaching the verdict by
      some occult mental process.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the delay the spectators exhibited unexampled patience, finding
      amusement and relief in the slightest movements of the court, the prisoner
      and the lawyers. Mr. Braham divided with Laura the attention of the house.
      Bets were made by the Sheriff&rsquo;s deputies on the verdict, with large odds
      in favor of a disagreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was afternoon when it was announced that the jury was coming in. The
      reporters took their places and were all attention; the judge and lawyers
      were in their seats; the crowd swayed and pushed in eager expectancy, as
      the jury walked in and stood up in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge. &ldquo;Gentlemen, have you agreed upon your verdict?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foreman. &ldquo;We have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Foreman. &ldquo;NOT GUILTY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shout went up from the entire room and a tumult of cheering which the
      court in vain attempted to quell. For a few moments all order was lost.
      The spectators crowded within the bar and surrounded Laura who, calmer
      than anyone else, was supporting her aged mother, who had almost fainted
      from excess of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now occurred one of those beautiful incidents which no fiction-writer
      would dare to imagine, a scene of touching pathos, creditable to our
      fallen humanity. In the eyes of the women of the audience Mr. Braham was
      the hero of the occasion; he had saved the life of the prisoner; and
      besides he was such a handsome man. The women could not restrain their
      long pent-up emotions. They threw themselves upon Mr. Braham in a
      transport of gratitude; they kissed him again and again, the young as well
      as the advanced in years, the married as well as the ardent single women;
      they improved the opportunity with a touching self-sacrifice; in the words
      of a newspaper of the day they &ldquo;lavished him with kisses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was something sweet to do; and it would be sweet for a woman to
      remember in after years, that she had kissed Braham! Mr. Braham himself
      received these fond assaults with the gallantry of his nation, enduring
      the ugly, and heartily paying back beauty in its own coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This beautiful scene is still known in New York as &ldquo;the kissing of
      Braham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p523" id="p523"></a>
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      When the tumult of congratulation had a little spent itself, and order was
      restored, Judge O&rsquo;Shaunnessy said that it now became his duty to provide
      for the proper custody and treatment of the acquitted. The verdict of the
      jury having left no doubt that the woman was of an unsound mind, with a
      kind of insanity dangerous to the safety of the community, she could not
      be permitted to go at large. &ldquo;In accordance with the directions of the law
      in such cases,&rdquo; said the Judge, &ldquo;and in obedience to the dictates of a
      wise humanity, I hereby commit Laura Hawkins to the care of the
      Superintendent of the State Hospital for Insane Criminals, to be held in
      confinement until the State Commissioners on Insanity shall order her
      discharge. Mr. Sheriff, you will attend at once to the execution of this
      decree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura was overwhelmed and terror-stricken. She had expected to walk forth
      in freedom in a few moments. The revulsion was terrible. Her mother
      appeared like one shaken with an ague fit. Laura insane! And about to be
      locked up with madmen! She had never contemplated this. Mr. Graham said he
      should move at once for a writ of &lsquo;habeas corpus&rsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the judge could not do less than his duty, the law must have its way.
      As in the stupor of a sudden calamity, and not fully comprehending it,
      Mrs. Hawkins saw Laura led away by the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      With little space for thought she was rapidly driven to the railway
      station, and conveyed to the Hospital for Lunatic Criminals. It was only
      when she was within this vast and grim abode of madness that she realized
      the horror of her situation. It was only when she was received by the kind
      physician and read pity in his eyes, and saw his look of hopeless
      incredulity when she attempted to tell him that she was not insane; it was
      only when she passed through the ward to which she was consigned and saw
      the horrible creatures, the victims of a double calamity, whose dreadful
      faces she was hereafter to see daily, and was locked into the small, bare
      room that was to be her home, that all her fortitude forsook her. She sank
      upon the bed, as soon as she was left alone&mdash;she had been searched by
      the matron&mdash;and tried to think. But her brain was in a whirl. She
      recalled Braham&rsquo;s speech, she recalled the testimony regarding her lunacy.
      She wondered if she were not mad; she felt that she soon should be among
      these loathsome creatures. Better almost to have died, than to slowly go
      mad in this confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;We beg the reader&rsquo;s pardon. This is not history, which has just
      been written. It is really what would have occurred if this were a novel.
      If this were a work of fiction, we should not dare to dispose of Laura
      otherwise. True art and any attention to dramatic proprieties required it.
      The novelist who would turn loose upon society an insane murderess could
      not escape condemnation. Besides, the safety of society, the decencies of
      criminal procedure, what we call our modern civilization, all would demand
      that Laura should be disposed of in the manner we have described.
      Foreigners, who read this sad story, will be unable to understand any
      other termination of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is history and not fiction. There is no such law or custom as
      that to which his Honor is supposed to have referred; Judge O&rsquo;Shaunnessy
      would not probably pay any attention to it if there were. There is no
      Hospital for Insane Criminals; there is no State commission of lunacy.
      What actually occurred when the tumult in the court room had subsided the
      sagacious reader will now learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura left the court room, accompanied by her mother and other friends,
      amid the congratulations of those assembled, and was cheered as she
      entered a carriage, and drove away. How sweet was the sunlight, how
      exhilarating the sense of freedom! Were not these following cheers the
      expression of popular approval and affection? Was she not the heroine of
      the hour?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p525" id="p525"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with a feeling of triumph that Laura reached her hotel, a scornful
      feeling of victory over society with its own weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hawkins shared not at all in this feeling; she was broken with the
      disgrace and the long anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, Laura,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is over. Now we will go away from this
      hateful city. Let us go home at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; replied Laura, speaking with some tenderness, &ldquo;I cannot go with
      you. There, don&rsquo;t cry, I cannot go back to that life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Hawkins was sobbing. This was more cruel than anything else, for she
      had a dim notion of what it would be to leave Laura to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mother, you have been everything to me. You know how dearly I love
      you. But I cannot go back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A boy brought in a telegraphic despatch. Laura took it and read:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The bill is lost. Dilworthy ruined. (Signed) WASHINGTON.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      For a moment the words swam before her eyes. The next her eyes flashed
      fire as she handed the dispatch to her mother and bitterly said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world is against me. Well, let it be, let it. I am against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a cruel disappointment,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hawkins, to whom one grief
      more or less did not much matter now, &ldquo;to you and, Washington; but we must
      humbly bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear it;&rdquo; replied Laura scornfully, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve all my life borne it, and fate
      has thwarted me at every step.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A servant came to the door to say that there was a gentleman below who
      wished to speak with Miss Hawkins. &ldquo;J. Adolphe Griller&rdquo; was the name Laura
      read on the card. &ldquo;I do not know such a person. He probably comes from
      Washington. Send him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Griller entered. He was a small man, slovenly in dress, his tone
      confidential, his manner wholly void of animation, all his features below
      the forehead protruding&mdash;particularly the apple of his throat&mdash;hair
      without a kink in it, a hand with no grip, a meek, hang-dog countenance.
      He was a falsehood done in flesh and blood; for while every visible sign
      about him proclaimed him a poor, witless, useless weakling, the truth was
      that he had the brains to plan great enterprises and the pluck to carry
      them through. That was his reputation, and it was a deserved one. He
      softly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I called to see you on business, Miss Hawkins. You have my card?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Griller continued to purr, as softly as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will proceed to business. I am a business man. I am a lecture-agent,
      Miss Hawkins, and as soon as I saw that you were acquitted, it occurred to
      me that an early interview would be mutually beneficial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you, sir,&rdquo; said Laura coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? You see, Miss Hawkins, this is your opportunity. If you will enter
      the lecture field under good auspices, you will carry everything before
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir, I never lectured, I haven&rsquo;t any lecture, I don&rsquo;t know anything
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, madam, that makes no difference&mdash;no real difference. It is not
      necessary to be able to lecture in order to go into the lecture tour. If
      ones name is celebrated all over the land, especially, and, if she is also
      beautiful, she is certain to draw large audiences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what should I lecture about?&rdquo; asked Laura, beginning in spite of
      herself to be a little interested as well as amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, why; woman&mdash;something about woman, I should say; the marriage
      relation, woman&rsquo;s fate, anything of that sort. Call it The Revelations of
      a Woman&rsquo;s Life; now, there&rsquo;s a good title. I wouldn&rsquo;t want any better
      title than that. I&rsquo;m prepared to make you an offer, Miss Hawkins, a
      liberal offer,&mdash;twelve thousand dollars for thirty nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laura thought. She hesitated. Why not? It would give her employment,
      money. She must do something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will think of it, and let you know soon. But still, there is very
      little likelihood that I&mdash;however, we will not discuss it further
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, that the sooner we get to work the better, Miss Hawkins, public
      curiosity is so fickle. Good day, madam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The close of the trial released Mr. Harry Brierly and left him free to
      depart upon his long talked of Pacific-coast mission. He was very
      mysterious about it, even to Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s confidential, old boy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a little scheme we have hatched
      up. I don&rsquo;t mind telling you that it&rsquo;s a good deal bigger thing than that
      in Missouri, and a sure thing. I wouldn&rsquo;t take a half a million just for
      my share. And it will open something for you, Phil. You will hear from
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip did hear from Harry a few months afterward. Everything promised
      splendidly, but there was a little delay. Could Phil let him have a
      hundred, say, for ninety days?
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip himself hastened to Philadelphia, and, as soon as the spring
      opened, to the mine at Ilium, and began transforming the loan he had
      received from Squire Montague into laborers&rsquo; wages. He was haunted with
      many anxieties; in the first place, Ruth was overtaxing her strength in
      her hospital labors, and Philip felt as if he must move heaven and earth
      to save her from such toil and suffering. His increased pecuniary
      obligation oppressed him. It seemed to him also that he had been one cause
      of the misfortune to the Bolton family, and that he was dragging into loss
      and ruin everybody who associated with him. He worked on day after day and
      week after week, with a feverish anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be wicked, thought Philip, and impious, to pray for luck; he felt
      that perhaps he ought not to ask a blessing upon the sort of labor that
      was only a venture; but yet in that daily petition, which this very faulty
      and not very consistent young Christian gentleman put up, he prayed
      earnestly enough for Ruth and for the Boltons and for those whom he loved
      and who trusted in him, and that his life might not be a misfortune to
      them and a failure to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this young fellow went out into the world from his New England home,
      he had done some things that he would rather his mother should not know,
      things maybe that he would shrink from telling Ruth. At a certain green
      age young gentlemen are sometimes afraid of being called milksops, and
      Philip&rsquo;s associates had not always been the most select, such as these
      historians would have chosen for him, or whom at a later, period he would
      have chosen for himself. It seemed inexplicable, for instance, that his
      life should have been thrown so much with his college acquaintance, Henry
      Brierly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, this was true of Philip, that in whatever company he had been he had
      never been ashamed to stand up for the principles he learned from his
      mother, and neither raillery nor looks of wonder turned him from that
      daily habit he had learned at his mother&rsquo;s knees.&mdash;Even flippant
      Harry respected this, and perhaps it was one of the reasons why Harry and
      all who knew Philip trusted him implicitly. And yet it must be confessed
      that Philip did not convey the impression to the world of a very serious
      young man, or of a man who might not rather easily fall into temptation.
      One looking for a real hero would have to go elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parting between Laura and her mother was exceedingly painful to both.
      It was as if two friends parted on a wide plain, the one to journey
      towards the setting and the other towards the rising sun, each
      comprehending that every step henceforth must separate their lives, wider
      and wider.

      When Mr. Noble&rsquo;s bombshell fell in Senator Dilworthy&rsquo;s camp, the statesman

      he was calmly up and doing. From the centre of our country to its

      and the people were furious. Mind, they were not furious because bribery
      was uncommon in our public life, but merely because here was another case.
      Perhaps it did not occur to the nation of good and worthy people that
      while they continued to sit comfortably at home and leave the true source
      of our political power (the &ldquo;primaries,&rdquo;) in the hands of saloon-keepers,
      dog-fanciers and hod-carriers, they could go on expecting &ldquo;another&rdquo; case
      of this kind, and even dozens and hundreds of them, and never be
      disappointed. However, they may have thought that to sit at home and
      grumble would some day right the evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, the nation was excited, but Senator Dilworthy was calm&mdash;what was
      left of him after the explosion of the shell. Calm, and up and doing. What
      did he do first? What would you do first, after you had tomahawked your
      mother at the breakfast table for putting too much sugar in your coffee?
      You would &ldquo;ask for a suspension of public opinion.&rdquo; That is what Senator
      Dilworthy did. It is the custom. He got the usual amount of suspension.
      Far and wide he was called a thief, a briber, a promoter of steamship
      subsidies, railway swindles, robberies of the government in all possible
      forms and fashions. Newspapers and everybody else called him a pious
      hypocrite, a sleek, oily fraud, a reptile who manipulated temperance
      movements, prayer meetings, Sunday schools, public charities, missionary
      enterprises, all for his private benefit. And as these charges were backed
      up by what seemed to be good and sufficient, evidence, they were believed
      with national unanimity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Dilworthy made another move. He moved instantly to Washington and
      &ldquo;demanded an investigation.&rdquo; Even this could not pass without comment.
      Many papers used language to this effect:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Senator Dilworthy&rsquo;s remains have demanded an investigation. This sounds
        fine and bold and innocent; but when we reflect that they demand it at
        the hands of the Senate of the United States, it simply becomes matter
        for derision. One might as well set the gentlemen detained in the public
        prisons to trying each other. This investigation is likely to be like
        all other Senatorial investigations&mdash;amusing but not useful. Query.
        Why does the Senate still stick to this pompous word, &lsquo;Investigation?&rsquo;
        One does not blindfold one&rsquo;s self in order to investigate an object.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Mr. Dilworthy appeared in his place in the Senate and offered a resolution
      appointing a committee to investigate his case. It carried, of course, and
      the committee was appointed. Straightway the newspapers said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Under the guise of appointing a committee to investigate the late Mr.
        Dilworthy, the Senate yesterday appointed a committee to investigate his
        accuser, Mr. Noble. This is the exact spirit and meaning of the
        resolution, and the committee cannot try anybody but Mr. Noble without
        overstepping its authority. That Dilworthy had the effrontery to offer
        such a resolution will surprise no one, and that the Senate could
        entertain it without blushing and pass it without shame will surprise no
        one. We are now reminded of a note which we have received from the
        notorious burglar Murphy, in which he finds fault with a statement of
        ours to the effect that he had served one term in the penitentiary and
        also one in the U. S. Senate. He says, &lsquo;The latter statement is untrue
        and does me great injustice.&rsquo; After an unconscious sarcasm like that,
        further comment is unnecessary.&rdquo;
       </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And yet the Senate was roused by the Dilworthy trouble. Many speeches were
      made. One Senator (who was accused in the public prints of selling his
      chances of re-election to his opponent for $50,000 and had not yet denied
      the charge) said that, &ldquo;the presence in the Capital of such a creature as
      this man Noble, to testify against a brother member of their body, was an
      insult to the Senate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another Senator said, &ldquo;Let the investigation go on and let it make an
      example of this man Noble; let it teach him and men like him that they
      could not attack the reputation of a United States Senator with impunity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another said he was glad the investigation was to be had, for it was high
      time that the Senate should crush some cur like this man Noble, and thus
      show his kind that it was able and resolved to uphold its ancient dignity.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A by-stander laughed, at this finely delivered peroration; and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this is the Senator who franked his baggage home through the mails
      last week&mdash;registered, at that. However, perhaps he was merely
      engaged in &lsquo;upholding the ancient dignity of the Senate,&rsquo;&mdash;then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the modern dignity of it,&rdquo; said another by-stander. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t
      resemble its ancient dignity but it fits its modern style like a glove.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There being no law against making offensive remarks about U. S. Senators,
      this conversation, and others like it, continued without let or hindrance.
      But our business is with the investigating committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Noble appeared before the Committee of the Senate; and testified to
      the following effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      He said that he was a member of the State legislature of the
      Happy-Land-of-Canaan; that on the &mdash;- day of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; he
      assembled himself together at the city of Saint&rsquo;s Rest, the capital of the
      State, along with his brother legislators; that he was known to be a
      political enemy of Mr. Dilworthy and bitterly opposed to his re-election;
      that Mr. Dilworthy came to Saint&rsquo;s Rest and reported to be buying pledges
      of votes with money; that the said Dilworthy sent for him to come to his
      room in the hotel at night, and he went; was introduced to Mr. Dilworthy;
      called two or three times afterward at Dilworthy&rsquo;s request&mdash;usually
      after midnight; Mr. Dilworthy urged him to vote for him; Noble declined;
      Dilworthy argued; said he was bound to be elected, and could then ruin him
      (Noble) if he voted no; said he had every railway and every public office
      and stronghold of political power in the State under his thumb, and could
      set up or pull down any man he chose; gave instances showing where and how
      he had used this power; if Noble would vote for him he would make him a
      Representative in Congress; Noble still declined to vote, and said he did
      not believe Dilworthy was going to be elected; Dilworthy showed a list of
      men who would vote for him&mdash;a majority of the legislature; gave
      further proofs of his power by telling Noble everything the opposing party
      had done or said in secret caucus; claimed that his spies reported
      everything to him, and that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a member of the Committee objected that this evidence was irrelevant
      and also in opposition to the spirit of the Committee&rsquo;s instructions,
      because if these things reflected upon any one it was upon Mr. Dilworthy.
      The chairman said, let the person proceed with his statement&mdash;the
      Committee could exclude evidence that did not bear upon the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Noble continued. He said that his party would cast him out if he voted
      for Mr. Dilworthy; Dilworthy said that that would inure to his benefit
      because he would then be a recognized friend of his (Dilworthy&rsquo;s) and he
      could consistently exalt him politically and make his fortune; Noble said
      he was poor, and it was hard to tempt him so; Dilworthy said he would fix
      that; he said, &ldquo;Tell, me what you want, and say you will vote for me;&rdquo;
       Noble could not say; Dilworthy said &ldquo;I will give you $5,000.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A Committee man said, impatiently, that this stuff was all outside the
      case, and valuable time was being wasted; this was all a plain reflection
      upon a brother Senator. The Chairman said it was the quickest way to
      proceed, and the evidence need have no weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Noble continued. He said he told Dilworthy that $5,000 was not much to
      pay for a man&rsquo;s honor, character and everything that was worth having;
      Dilworthy said he was surprised; he considered $5,000 a fortune&mdash;for
      some men; asked what Noble&rsquo;s figure was; Noble said he could not think
      $10,000 too little; Dilworthy said it was a great deal too much; he would
      not do it for any other man, but he had conceived a liking for Noble, and
      where he liked a man his heart yearned to help him; he was aware that
      Noble was poor, and had a family to support, and that he bore an
      unblemished reputation at home; for such a man and such a man&rsquo;s influence
      he could do much, and feel that to help such a man would be an act that
      would have its reward; the struggles of the poor always touched him; he
      believed that Noble would make a good use of this money and that it would
      cheer many a sad heart and needy home; he would give the $10,000; all he
      desired in return was that when the balloting began, Noble should cast his
      vote for him and should explain to the legislature that upon looking into
      the charges against Mr. Dilworthy of bribery, corruption, and forwarding
      stealing measures in Congress he had found them to be base calumnies upon
      a man whose motives were pure and whose character was stainless; he then
      took from his pocket $2,000 in bank bills and handed them to Noble, and
      got another package containing $5,000 out of his trunk and gave to him
      also. He&mdash;&mdash;

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A Committee man jumped up, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, Mr. Chairman, this shameless person has arrived at the point.
      This is sufficient and conclusive. By his own confession he has received a
      bribe, and did it deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a grave offense, and cannot be passed over in silence, sir. By
      the terms of our instructions we can now proceed to mete out to him such
      punishment as is meet for one who has maliciously brought disrespect upon
      a Senator of the United States. We have no need to hear the rest of his
      evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chairman said it would be better and more regular to proceed with the
      investigation according to the usual forms. A note would be made of Mr.
      Noble&rsquo;s admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Noble continued. He said that it was now far past midnight; that he
      took his leave and went straight to certain legislators, told them
      everything, made them count the money, and also told them of the exposure
      he would make in joint convention; he made that exposure, as all the world
      knew. The rest of the $10,000 was to be paid the day after Dilworthy was
      elected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dilworthy was now asked to take the stand and tell what he knew
      about the man Noble. The Senator wiped his mouth with his handkerchief,
      adjusted his white cravat, and said that but for the fact that public
      morality required an example, for the warning of future Nobles, he would
      beg that in Christian charity this poor misguided creature might be
      forgiven and set free. He said that it was but too evident that this
      person had approached him in the hope of obtaining a bribe; he had
      intruded himself time and again, and always with moving stories of his
      poverty. Mr. Dilworthy said that his heart had bled for him&mdash;insomuch
      that he had several times been on the point of trying to get some one to
      do something for him. Some instinct had told him from the beginning that
      this was a bad man, an evil-minded man, but his inexperience of such had
      blinded him to his real motives, and hence he had never dreamed that his
      object was to undermine the purity of a United States Senator. He
      regretted that it was plain, now, that such was the man&rsquo;s object and that
      punishment could not with safety to the Senate&rsquo;s honor be withheld. He
      grieved to say that one of those mysterious dispensations of an
      inscrutable Providence which are decreed from time to time by His wisdom
      and for His righteous, purposes, had given this conspirator&rsquo;s tale a color
      of plausibility,&mdash;but this would soon disappear under the clear light
      of truth which would now be thrown upon the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened, (said the Senator,) that about the time in question, a
      poor young friend of mine, living in a distant town of my State, wished to
      establish a bank; he asked me to lend him the necessary money; I said I
      had no, money just then, but world try to borrow it. The day before the
      election a friend said to me that my election expenses must be very large
      specially my hotel bills, and offered to lend me some money. Remembering
      my young, friend, I said I would like a few thousands now, and a few more
      by and by; whereupon he gave me two packages of bills said to contain
      $2,000 and $5,000 respectively; I did not open the packages or count the
      money; I did not give any note or receipt for the same; I made no
      memorandum of the transaction, and neither did my friend. That night this
      evil man Noble came troubling me again: I could not rid myself of him,
      though my time was very precious. He mentioned my young friend and said he
      was very anxious to have the $7000 now to begin his banking operations
      with, and could wait a while for the rest. Noble wished to get the money
      and take it to him. I finally gave him the two packages of bills; I took
      no note or receipt from him, and made no memorandum of the matter. I no
      more look for duplicity and deception in another man than I would look for
      it in myself. I never thought of this man again until I was overwhelmed
      the next day by learning what a shameful use he had made of the confidence
      I had reposed in him and the money I had entrusted to his care. This is
      all, gentlemen. To the absolute truth of every detail of my statement I
      solemnly swear, and I call Him to witness who is the Truth and the loving
      Father of all whose lips abhor false speaking; I pledge my honor as a
      Senator, that I have spoken but the truth. May God forgive this wicked man
      as I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Noble&mdash;&ldquo;Senator Dilworthy, your bank account shows that up to
      that day, and even on that very day, you conducted all your financial
      business through the medium of checks instead of bills, and so kept
      careful record of every moneyed transaction. Why did you deal in bank
      bills on this particular occasion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p538" id="p538"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p538.jpg (40K)" src="images/p538.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chairman&mdash;&ldquo;The gentleman will please to remember that the
      Committee is conducting this investigation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Noble&mdash;&ldquo;Then will the Committee ask the question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chairman&mdash;&ldquo;The Committee will&mdash;when it desires to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Noble&mdash;&ldquo;Which will not be during this century perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chairman&mdash;&ldquo;Another remark like that, sir, will procure you the
      attentions of the Sergeant-at-arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Noble&mdash;&ldquo;D&mdash;n the Sergeant-at-arms, and the Committee too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Several Committeemen&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, this is Contempt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Noble&mdash;&ldquo;Contempt of whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the Committee! Of the Senate of the United States!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Noble&mdash;&ldquo;Then I am become the acknowledged representative of a
      nation. You know as well as I do that the whole nation hold as much as
      three-fifths of the United States Senate in entire contempt.&mdash;Three-fifths
      of you are Dilworthys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant-at-arms very soon put a quietus upon the observations of the
      representative of the nation, and convinced him that he was not in the
      over-free atmosphere of his Happy-Land-of-Canaan:
    </p>
    <p>
      The statement of Senator Dilworthy naturally carried conviction to the
      minds of the committee.&mdash;It was close, logical, unanswerable; it bore
      many internal evidences of its truth. For instance, it is customary in all
      countries for business men to loan large sums of money in bank bills
      instead of checks. It is customary for the lender to make no memorandum of
      the transaction. It is customary, for the borrower to receive the money
      without making a memorandum of it, or giving a note or a receipt for it&rsquo;s
      use&mdash;the borrower is not likely to die or forget about it. It is
      customary to lend nearly anybody money to start a bank with especially if
      you have not the money to lend him and have to borrow it for the purpose.
      It is customary to carry large sums of money in bank bills about your
      person or in your trunk. It is customary to hand a large sum in bank bills
      to a man you have just been introduced to (if he asks you to do it,) to be
      conveyed to a distant town and delivered to another party. It is not
      customary to make a memorandum of this transaction; it is not customary
      for the conveyor to give a note or a receipt for the money; it is not
      customary to require that he shall get a note or a receipt from the man he
      is to convey it to in the distant town. It would be at least singular in
      you to say to the proposed conveyor, &ldquo;You might be robbed; I will deposit
      the money in a bank and send a check for it to my friend through the
      mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very well. It being plain that Senator Dilworthy&rsquo;s statement was rigidly
      true, and this fact being strengthened by his adding to it the support of
      &ldquo;his honor as a Senator,&rdquo; the Committee rendered a verdict of &ldquo;Not proven
      that a bribe had been offered and accepted.&rdquo; This in a manner exonerated
      Noble and let him escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Committee made its report to the Senate, and that body proceeded to
      consider its acceptance. One Senator indeed, several Senators&mdash;objected
      that the Committee had failed of its duty; they had proved this man Noble
      guilty of nothing, they had meted out no punishment to him; if the report
      were accepted, he would go forth free and scathless, glorying in his
      crime, and it would be a tacit admission that any blackguard could insult
      the Senate of the United States and conspire against the sacred reputation
      of its members with impunity; the Senate owed it to the upholding of its
      ancient dignity to make an example of this man Noble&mdash;he should be
      crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      An elderly Senator got up and took another view of the case. This was a
      Senator of the worn-out and obsolete pattern; a man still lingering among
      the cobwebs of the past, and behind the spirit of the age. He said that
      there seemed to be a curious misunderstanding of the case. Gentlemen
      seemed exceedingly anxious to preserve and maintain the honor and dignity
      of the Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p541" id="p541"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p541.jpg (21K)" src="images/p541.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this to be done by trying an obscure adventurer for attempting to trap
      a Senator into bribing him? Or would not the truer way be to find out
      whether the Senator was capable of being entrapped into so shameless an
      act, and then try him? Why, of course. Now the whole idea of the Senate
      seemed to be to shield the Senator and turn inquiry away from him. The
      true way to uphold the honor of the Senate was to have none but honorable
      men in its body. If this Senator had yielded to temptation and had offered
      a bribe, he was a soiled man and ought to be instantly expelled; therefore
      he wanted the Senator tried, and not in the usual namby-pamby way, but in
      good earnest. He wanted to know the truth of this matter. For himself, he
      believed that the guilt of Senator Dilworthy was established beyond the
      shadow of a doubt; and he considered that in trifling with his case and
      shirking it the Senate was doing a shameful and cowardly thing&mdash;a
      thing which suggested that in its willingness to sit longer in the company
      of such a man, it was acknowledging that it was itself of a kind with him
      and was therefore not dishonored by his presence. He desired that a rigid
      examination be made into Senator Dilworthy&rsquo;s case, and that it be
      continued clear into the approaching extra session if need be. There was
      no dodging this thing with the lame excuse of want of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply, an honorable Senator said that he thought it would be as well to
      drop the matter and accept the Committee&rsquo;s report. He said with some
      jocularity that the more one agitated this thing, the worse it was for the
      agitator. He was not able to deny that he believed Senator Dilworthy to be
      guilty&mdash;but what then? Was it such an extraordinary case? For his
      part, even allowing the Senator to be guilty, he did not think his
      continued presence during the few remaining days of the Session would
      contaminate the Senate to a dreadful degree. [This humorous sally was
      received with smiling admiration&mdash;notwithstanding it was not wholly
      new, having originated with the Massachusetts General in the House a day

      selling his vote for money.]

    <p>
      The Senate recognized the fact that it could not be contaminated by
      sitting a few days longer with Senator Dilworthy, and so it accepted the
      committee&rsquo;s report and dropped the unimportant matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dilworthy occupied his seat to the last hour of the session. He said
      that his people had reposed a trust in him, and it was not for him to
      desert them. He would remain at his post till he perished, if need be.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was lifted up and his vote cast for the last time, in support of
      an ingenious measure contrived by the General from Massachusetts whereby
      the President&rsquo;s salary was proposed to be doubled and every Congressman
      paid several thousand dollars extra for work previously done, under an
      accepted contract, and already paid for once and receipted for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Senator Dilworthy was offered a grand ovation by his friends at home, who
      said that their affection for him and their confidence in him were in no
      wise impaired by the persecutions that had pursued him, and that he was
      still good enough for them.

        Dilworthy made one little effort through his protege the embryo banker
        to recover it, but there being no notes of hand or, other memoranda to
        support the claim, it failed. The moral of which is, that when one loans

    <p>
      For some days Laura had been a free woman once more. During this time, she
      had experienced&mdash;first, two or three days of triumph, excitement,
      congratulations, a sort of sunburst of gladness, after a long night of
      gloom and anxiety; then two or three days of calming down, by degrees&mdash;a
      receding of tides, a quieting of the storm-wash to a murmurous surf-beat,
      a diminishing of devastating winds to a refrain that bore the spirit of a
      truce-days given to solitude, rest, self-communion, and the reasoning of
      herself into a realization of the fact that she was actually done with
      bolts and bars, prison horrors and impending death; then came a day whose
      hours filed slowly by her, each laden with some remnant, some remaining
      fragment of the dreadful time so lately ended&mdash;a day which, closing
      at last, left the past a fading shore behind her and turned her eyes
      toward the broad sea of the future. So speedily do we put the dead away
      and come back to our place in the ranks to march in the pilgrimage of life
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the sun rose once more and ushered in the first day of what Laura
      comprehended and accepted as a new life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The past had sunk below the horizon, and existed no more for her; she was
      done with it for all time. She was gazing out over the trackless expanses
      of the future, now, with troubled eyes. Life must be begun again&mdash;at
      eight and twenty years of age. And where to begin? The page was blank, and
      waiting for its first record; so this was indeed a momentous day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thoughts drifted back, stage by stage, over her career. As far as the
      long highway receded over the plain of her life, it was lined with the
      gilded and pillared splendors of her ambition all crumbled to ruin and
      ivy-grown; every milestone marked a disaster; there was no green spot
      remaining anywhere in memory of a hope that had found its fruition; the
      unresponsive earth had uttered no voice of flowers in testimony that one
      who was blest had gone that road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her life had been a failure. That was plain, she said. No more of that.
      She would now look the future in the face; she would mark her course upon
      the chart of life, and follow it; follow it without swerving, through
      rocks and shoals, through storm and calm, to a haven of rest and peace or
      shipwreck. Let the end be what it might, she would mark her course now&mdash;to-day&mdash;and
      follow it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On her table lay six or seven notes. They were from lovers; from some of
      the prominent names in the land; men whose devotion had survived even the
      grisly revealments of her character which the courts had uncurtained; men
      who knew her now, just as she was, and yet pleaded as for their lives for
      the dear privilege of calling the murderess wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she read these passionate, these worshiping, these supplicating
      missives, the woman in her nature confessed itself; a strong yearning came
      upon her to lay her head upon a loyal breast and find rest from the
      conflict of life, solace for her griefs, the healing of love for her
      bruised heart.

    </p>
    <p>
      With her forehead resting upon her hand, she sat thinking, thinking, while
      the unheeded moments winged their flight. It was one of those mornings in
      early spring when nature seems just stirring to a half consciousness out
      of a long, exhausting lethargy; when the first faint balmy airs go
      wandering about, whispering the secret of the coming change; when the
      abused brown grass, newly relieved of snow, seems considering whether it
      can be worth the trouble and worry of contriving its green raiment again
      only to fight the inevitable fight with the implacable winter and be
      vanquished and buried once more; when the sun shines out and a few birds
      venture forth and lift up a forgotten song; when a strange stillness and
      suspense pervades the waiting air. It is a time when one&rsquo;s spirit is
      subdued and sad, one knows not why; when the past seems a storm-swept
      desolation, life a vanity and a burden, and the future but a way to death.
      It is a time when one is filled with vague longings; when one dreams of
      flight to peaceful islands in the remote solitudes of the sea, or folds
      his hands and says, What is the use of struggling, and toiling and
      worrying any more? let us give it all up.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was into such a mood as this that Laura had drifted from the musings
      which the letters of her lovers had called up. Now she lifted her head and
      noted with surprise how the day had wasted. She thrust the letters aside,
      rose up and went and stood at the window. But she was soon thinking again,
      and was only gazing into vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by she turned; her countenance had cleared; the dreamy look was
      gone out of her face, all indecision had vanished; the poise of her head
      and the firm set of her lips told that her resolution was formed. She
      moved toward the table with all the old dignity in her carriage, and all
      the old pride in her mien. She took up each letter in its turn, touched a
      match to it and watched it slowly consume to ashes. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have landed upon a foreign shore, and burned my ships behind me. These
      letters were the last thing that held me in sympathy with any remnant or
      belonging of the old life. Henceforth that life and all that appertains to
      it are as dead to me and as far removed from me as if I were become a
      denizen of another world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p546" id="p546"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p546.jpg (25K)" src="images/p546.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She said that love was not for her&mdash;the time that it could have
      satisfied her heart was gone by and could not return; the opportunity was
      lost, nothing could restore it. She said there could be no love without
      respect, and she would only despise a man who could content himself with a
      thing like her. Love, she said, was a woman&rsquo;s first necessity: love being
      forfeited; there was but one thing left that could give a passing zest to
      a wasted life, and that was fame, admiration, the applause of the
      multitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so her resolution was taken. She would turn to that final resort of
      the disappointed of her sex, the lecture platform. She would array herself
      in fine attire, she would adorn herself with jewels, and stand in her
      isolated magnificence before massed audiences and enchant them with her
      eloquence and amaze them with her unapproachable beauty. She would move
      from city to city like a queen of romance, leaving marveling multitudes
      behind her and impatient multitudes awaiting her coming. Her life, during
      one hour of each day, upon the platform, would be a rapturous intoxication&mdash;and
      when the curtain fell and the lights were out, and the people gone, to
      nestle in their homes and forget her, she would find in sleep oblivion of
      her homelessness, if she could, if not she would brave out the night in
      solitude and wait for the next day&rsquo;s hour of ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to take up life and begin again was no great evil. She saw her way.
      She would be brave and strong; she would make the best of what was left
      for her among the possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent for the lecture agent, and matters were soon arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Straightway, all the papers were filled with her name, and all the dead
      walls flamed with it. The papers called down imprecations upon her head;
      they reviled her without stint; they wondered if all sense of decency was
      dead in this shameless murderess, this brazen lobbyist, this heartless
      seducer of the affections of weak and misguided men; they implored the
      people, for the sake of their pure wives, their sinless daughters, for the
      sake of decency, for the sake of public morals, to give this wretched
      creature such a rebuke as should be an all-sufficient evidence to her and
      to such as her, that there was a limit where the flaunting of their foul
      acts and opinions before the world must stop; certain of them, with a
      higher art, and to her a finer cruelty, a sharper torture, uttered no
      abuse, but always spoke of her in terms of mocking eulogy and ironical
      admiration. Everybody talked about the new wonder, canvassed the theme of
      her proposed discourse, and marveled how she would handle it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura&rsquo;s few friends wrote to her or came and talked with her, and pleaded
      with her to retire while it was yet time, and not attempt to face the
      gathering storm. But it was fruitless. She was stung to the quick by the
      comments of the newspapers; her spirit was roused, her ambition was
      towering, now. She was more determined than ever. She would show these
      people what a hunted and persecuted woman could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eventful night came. Laura arrived before the great lecture hall in a
      close carriage within five minutes of the time set for the lecture to
      begin. When she stepped out of the vehicle her heart beat fast and her
      eyes flashed with exultation: the whole street was packed with people, and
      she could hardly force her way to the hall! She reached the ante-room,
      threw off her wraps and placed herself before the dressing-glass. She
      turned herself this way and that&mdash;everything was satisfactory, her
      attire was perfect. She smoothed her hair, rearranged a jewel here and
      there, and all the while her heart sang within her, and her face was
      radiant. She had not been so happy for ages and ages, it seemed to her.
      Oh, no, she had never been so overwhelmingly grateful and happy in her
      whole life before. The lecture agent appeared at the door. She waved him
      away and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not disturb me. I want no introduction. And do not fear for me; the
      moment the hands point to eight I will step upon the platform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared. She held her watch before her. She was so impatient that
      the second-hand seemed whole tedious minutes dragging its way around the
      circle. At last the supreme moment came, and with head erect and the
      bearing of an empress she swept through the door and stood upon the stage.
      Her eyes fell upon only a vast, brilliant emptiness&mdash;there were not
      forty people in the house! There were only a handful of coarse men and ten
      or twelve still coarser women, lolling upon the benches and scattered
      about singly and in couples.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Her pulses stood still, her limbs quaked, the gladness went out of her
      face. There was a moment of silence, and then a brutal laugh and an
      explosion of cat-calls and hisses saluted her from the audience. The
      clamor grew stronger and louder, and insulting speeches were shouted at
      her. A half-intoxicated man rose up and threw something, which missed her
      but bespattered a chair at her side, and this evoked an outburst of
      laughter and boisterous admiration. She was bewildered, her strength was
      forsaking her. She reeled away from the platform, reached the ante-room,
      and dropped helpless upon a sofa. The lecture agent ran in, with a hurried
      question upon his lips; but she put forth her hands, and with the tears
      raining from her eyes, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do not speak! Take me away-please take me away, out of this dreadful
      place! Oh, this is like all my life&mdash;failure, disappointment, misery&mdash;always
      misery, always failure. What have I done, to be so pursued! Take me away,
      I beg of you, I implore you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon the pavement she was hustled by the mob, the surging masses roared
      her name and accompanied it with every species of insulting epithet; they
      thronged after the carriage, hooting, jeering, cursing, and even assailing
      the vehicle with missiles. A stone crushed through a blind, wounding
      Laura&rsquo;s forehead, and so stunning her that she hardly knew what further
      transpired during her flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long before her faculties were wholly restored, and then she found
      herself lying on the floor by a sofa in her own sitting-room, and alone.
      So she supposed she must have sat down upon the sofa and afterward fallen.
      She raised herself up, with difficulty, for the air was chilly and her
      limbs were stiff. She turned up the gas and sought the glass. She hardly
      knew herself, so worn and old she looked, and so marred with blood were
      her features. The night was far spent, and a dead stillness reigned. She
      sat down by her table, leaned her elbows upon it and put her face in her
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her thoughts wandered back over her old life again and her tears flowed
      unrestrained. Her pride was humbled, her spirit was broken. Her memory
      found but one resting place; it lingered about her young girlhood with a
      caressing regret; it dwelt upon it as the one brief interval of her life
      that bore no curse. She saw herself again in the budding grace of her
      twelve years, decked in her dainty pride of ribbons, consorting with the
      bees and the butterflies, believing in fairies, holding confidential
      converse with the flowers, busying herself all day long with airy trifles
      that were as weighty to her as the affairs that tax the brains of
      diplomats and emperors. She was without sin, then, and unacquainted with
      grief; the world was full of sunshine and her heart was full of music.
      From that&mdash;to this!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only die!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I could only go back, and be as I was
      then, for one hour&mdash;and hold my father&rsquo;s hand in mine again, and see
      all the household about me, as in that old innocent time&mdash;and then
      die! My God, I am humbled, my pride is all gone, my stubborn heart repents&mdash;have
      pity!&rdquo;

    <p>
      When the spring morning dawned, the form still sat there, the elbows
      resting upon the table and the face upon the hands. All day long the
      figure sat there, the sunshine enriching its costly raiment and flashing
      from its jewels; twilight came, and presently the stars, but still the
      figure remained; the moon found it there still, and framed the picture
      with the shadow of the window sash, and flooded it with mellow light; by
      and by the darkness swallowed it up, and later the gray dawn revealed it
      again; the new day grew toward its prime, and still the forlorn presence
      was undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now the keepers of the house had become uneasy; their periodical
      knockings still finding no response, they burst open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jury of inquest found that death had resulted from heart disease, and
      was instant and painless. That was all. Merely heart disease.

    <p>
      Clay Hawkins, years gone by, had yielded, after many a struggle, to the
      migratory and speculative instinct of our age and our people, and had
      wandered further and further westward upon trading ventures. Settling
      finally in Melbourne, Australia, he ceased to roam, became a steady-going
      substantial merchant, and prospered greatly. His life lay beyond the
      theatre of this tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      His remittances had supported the Hawkins family, entirely, from the time
      of his father&rsquo;s death until latterly when Laura by her efforts in
      Washington had been able to assist in this work. Clay was away on a long
      absence in some of the eastward islands when Laura&rsquo;s troubles began,
      trying (and almost in vain,) to arrange certain interests which had become
      disordered through a dishonest agent, and consequently he knew nothing of
      the murder till he returned and read his letters and papers. His natural
      impulse was to hurry to the States and save his sister if possible, for he
      loved her with a deep and abiding affection. His business was so crippled
      now, and so deranged, that to leave it would be ruin; therefore he sold
      out at a sacrifice that left him considerably reduced in worldly
      possessions, and began his voyage to San Francisco. Arrived there, he
      perceived by the newspapers that the trial was near its close. At Salt
      Lake later telegrams told him of the acquittal, and his gratitude was
      boundless&mdash;so boundless, indeed, that sleep was driven from his eyes
      by the pleasurable excitement almost as effectually as preceding weeks of
      anxiety had done it. He shaped his course straight for Hawkeye, now, and
      his meeting with his mother and the rest of the household was joyful&mdash;albeit
      he had been away so long that he seemed almost a stranger in his own home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the greetings and congratulations were hardly finished when all the
      journals in the land clamored the news of Laura&rsquo;s miserable death. Mrs.
      Hawkins was prostrated by this last blow, and it was well that Clay was at
      her side to stay her with comforting words and take upon himself the
      ordering of the household with its burden of labors and cares.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington Hawkins had scarcely more than entered upon that decade which
      carries one to the full blossom of manhood which we term the beginning of
      middle age, and yet a brief sojourn at the capital of the nation had made
      him old. His hair was already turning gray when the late session of
      Congress began its sittings; it grew grayer still, and rapidly, after the
      memorable day that saw Laura proclaimed a murderess; it waxed grayer and
      still grayer during the lagging suspense that succeeded it and after the
      crash which ruined his last hope&mdash;the failure of his bill in the
      Senate and the destruction of its champion, Dilworthy. A few days later,
      when he stood uncovered while the last prayer was pronounced over Laura&rsquo;s
      grave, his hair was whiter and his face hardly less old than the venerable
      minister&rsquo;s whose words were sounding in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week after this, he was sitting in a double-bedded room in a cheap
      boarding house in Washington, with Col. Sellers. The two had been living
      together lately, and this mutual cavern of theirs the Colonel sometimes
      referred to as their &ldquo;premises&rdquo; and sometimes as their &ldquo;apartments&rdquo;&mdash;more
      particularly when conversing with persons outside. A canvas-covered modern
      trunk, marked &ldquo;G. W. H.&rdquo; stood on end by the door, strapped and ready for
      a journey; on it lay a small morocco satchel, also marked &ldquo;G. W. H.&rdquo; There
      was another trunk close by&mdash;a worn, and scarred, and ancient hair
      relic, with &ldquo;B. S.&rdquo; wrought in brass nails on its top; on it lay a pair of
      saddle-bags that probably knew more about the last century than they could
      tell. Washington got up and walked the floor a while in a restless sort of
      way, and finally was about to sit down on the hair trunk.

      another like it in America, I reckon.&rdquo;

    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid not,&rdquo; said Washington, with a faint attempt at a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed; the man is dead that made that trunk and that saddle-bags.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are his great-grand-children still living?&rdquo; said Washington, with levity
      only in the words, not in the tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that&mdash;but anyway they
      can&rsquo;t make trunks and saddle-bags like that, if they are&mdash;no man
      can,&rdquo; said the Colonel with honest simplicity. &ldquo;Wife didn&rsquo;t like to see me
      going off with that trunk&mdash;she said it was nearly certain to be
      stolen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Why, aren&rsquo;t trunks always being stolen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;some kinds of trunks are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then; this is some kind of a trunk&mdash;and an almighty rare
      kind, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, why shouldn&rsquo;t a man want to steal it if he got a chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t know.&mdash;Why should he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Washington, I never heard anybody talk like you. Suppose you were a
      thief, and that trunk was lying around and nobody watching&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t
      you steal it? Come, now, answer fair&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you steal it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, since you corner me, I would take it,&mdash;but I wouldn&rsquo;t
      consider it stealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t! Well, that beats me. Now what would you call stealing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, taking property is stealing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Property! Now what a way to talk that is: What do you suppose that trunk
      is worth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it in good repair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfect. Hair rubbed off a little, but the main structure is perfectly
      sound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does it leak anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leak? Do you want to carry water in it? What do you mean by does it
      leak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;a&mdash;do the clothes fall out of it when it is&mdash;when it
      is stationary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confound it, Washington, you are trying to make fun of me. I don&rsquo;t know
      what has got into you to-day; you act mighty curious. What is the matter
      with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you, old friend. I am almost happy. I am, indeed. It
      wasn&rsquo;t Clay&rsquo;s telegram that hurried me up so and got me ready to start
      with you. It was a letter from Louise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! What is it? What does she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says come home&mdash;her father has consented, at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy, I want to congratulate you; I want to shake you by the hand! It&rsquo;s
      a long turn that has no lane at the end of it, as the proverb says, or
      somehow that way. You&rsquo;ll be happy yet, and Beriah Sellers will be there to
      see, thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it. General Boswell is pretty nearly a poor man, now. The
      railroad that was going to build up Hawkeye made short work of him, along
      with the rest. He isn&rsquo;t so opposed to a son-in-law without a fortune,
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without a fortune, indeed! Why that Tennessee Land&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the Tennessee Land, Colonel. I am done with that, forever and
      forever&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no! You can&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father, away back yonder, years ago, bought it for a blessing for his
      children, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed he did! Si Hawkins said to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It proved a curse to him as long as he lived, and never a curse like it
      was inflicted upon any man&rsquo;s heirs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to say there&rsquo;s more or less truth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It began to curse me when I was a baby, and it has cursed every hour of
      my life to this day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, lord, but it&rsquo;s so! Time and again my wife&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I depended on it all through my boyhood and never tried to do an honest
      stroke of work for my living&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right again&mdash;but then you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have chased it years and years as children chase butterflies. We might
      all have been prosperous, now; we might all have been happy, all these
      heart-breaking years, if we had accepted our poverty at first and gone
      contentedly to work and built up our own wealth by our own toil and sweat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so, it&rsquo;s so; bless my soul, how often I&rsquo;ve told Si Hawkins&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Instead of that, we have suffered more than the damned themselves suffer!
      I loved my father, and I honor his memory and recognize his good
      intentions; but I grieve for his mistaken ideas of conferring happiness
      upon his children. I am going to begin my life over again, and begin it
      and end it with good solid work! I&rsquo;ll leave my children no Tennessee
      Land!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoken like a man, sir, spoken like a man! Your hand, again my boy! And
      always remember that when a word of advice from Beriah Sellers can help,
      it is at your service. I&rsquo;m going to begin again, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. I&rsquo;ve seen enough to show me where my mistake was. The law is
      what I was born for. I shall begin the study of the law. Heavens and
      earth, but that Braham&rsquo;s a wonderful man&mdash;a wonderful man sir! Such a
      head! And such a way with him! But I could see that he was jealous of me.
      The little licks I got in in the course of my argument before the jury&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your argument! Why, you were a witness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, to the popular eye, to the popular eye&mdash;but I knew when I
      was dropping information and when I was letting drive at the court with an
      insidious argument. But the court knew it, bless you, and weakened every
      time! And Braham knew it. I just reminded him of it in a quiet way, and
      its final result, and he said in a whisper, &lsquo;You did it, Colonel, you did
      it, sir&mdash;but keep it mum for my sake; and I&rsquo;ll tell you what you do,&rsquo;
      says he, &lsquo;you go into the law, Col. Sellers&mdash;go into the law, sir;
      that&rsquo;s your native element!&rsquo; And into the law the subscriber is going.
      There&rsquo;s worlds of money in it!&mdash;whole worlds of money! Practice first
      in Hawkeye, then in Jefferson, then in St. Louis, then in New York! In the
      metropolis of the western world! Climb, and climb, and climb&mdash;and
      wind up on the Supreme bench. Beriah Sellers, Chief Justice of the Supreme
      Court of the United States, sir! A made man for all time and eternity!
      That&rsquo;s the way I block it out, sir&mdash;and it&rsquo;s as clear as day&mdash;clear
      as the rosy-morn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Washington had heard little of this. The first reference to Laura&rsquo;s trial
      had brought the old dejection to his face again, and he stood gazing out
      of the window at nothing, lost in reverie.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock-the postman handed in a letter. It was from Obedstown,
      East Tennessee, and was for Washington. He opened it. There was a note
      saying that enclosed he would please find a bill for the current year&rsquo;s
      taxes on the 75,000 acres of Tennessee Land belonging to the estate of
      Silas Hawkins, deceased, and added that the money must be paid within
      sixty days or the land would be sold at public auction for the taxes, as
      provided by law. The bill was for $180&mdash;something more than twice the
      market value of the land, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington hesitated. Doubts flitted through his mind. The old instinct
      came upon him to cling to the land just a little longer and give it one
      more chance. He walked the floor feverishly, his mind tortured by
      indecision. Presently he stopped, took out his pocket book and counted his
      money. Two hundred and thirty dollars&mdash;it was all he had in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred and eighty . . . . . . . from two hundred and thirty,&rdquo; he
      said to himself. &ldquo;Fifty left . . . . . . It is enough to get me home . . .
      . . . . Shall I do it, or shall I not? . . . . I wish I had somebody to
      decide for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pocket book lay open in his hand, with Louise&rsquo;s small letter in view.
      His eye fell upon that, and it decided him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall go for taxes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and never tempt me or mine any more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the window and stood there tearing the tax bill to bits and
      watching the breeze waft them away, till all were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spell is broken, the life-long curse is ended!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let us go.&rdquo;

      The baggage wagon had arrived; five minutes later the two friends were
      mounted upon their luggage in it, and rattling off toward the station, the
      Colonel endeavoring to sing &ldquo;Homeward Bound,&rdquo; a song whose words he knew,
      but whose tune, as he rendered it, was a trial to auditors.

      Philip Sterling&rsquo;s circumstances were becoming straightened. The prospect
      was gloomy. His long siege of unproductive labor was beginning to tell
      upon his spirits; but what told still more upon them was the undeniable
      fact that the promise of ultimate success diminished every day, now. That
      is to say, the tunnel had reached a point in the hill which was
      considerably beyond where the coal vein should pass (according to all his
      calculations) if there were a coal vein there; and so, every foot that the
      tunnel now progressed seemed to carry it further away from the object of
      the search.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he ventured to hope that he had made a mistake in estimating the
      direction which the vein should naturally take after crossing the valley
      and entering the hill. Upon such occasions he would go into the nearest
      mine on the vein he was hunting for, and once more get the bearings of the
      deposit and mark out its probable course; but the result was the same
      every time; his tunnel had manifestly pierced beyond the natural point of
      junction; and then his spirits fell a little lower. His men had already
      lost faith, and he often overheard them saying it was perfectly plain that
      there was no coal in the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foremen and laborers from neighboring mines, and no end of experienced
      loafers from the village, visited the tunnel from time to time, and their
      verdicts were always the same and always disheartening&mdash;&ldquo;No coal in
      that hill.&rdquo; Now and then Philip would sit down and think it all over and
      wonder what the mystery meant; then he would go into the tunnel and ask
      the men if there were no signs yet? None&mdash;always &ldquo;none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He would bring out a piece of rock and examine it, and say to himself, &ldquo;It
      is limestone&mdash;it has crinoids and corals in it&mdash;the rock is
      right&rdquo; Then he would throw it down with a sigh, and say, &ldquo;But that is
      nothing; where coal is, limestone with these fossils in it is pretty
      certain to lie against its foot casing; but it does not necessarily follow
      that where this peculiar rock is coal must lie above it or beyond it; this
      sign is not sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thought usually followed:&mdash;&ldquo;There is one infallible sign&mdash;if
      I could only strike that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three or four times in as many weeks he said to himself, &ldquo;Am I a
      visionary? I must be a visionary; everybody is in these days; everybody
      chases butterflies: everybody seeks sudden fortune and will not lay one up
      by slow toil. This is not right, I will discharge the men and go at some
      honest work. There is no coal here. What a fool I have been; I will give
      it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he never could do it. A half hour of profound thinking always
      followed; and at the end of it he was sure to get up and straighten
      himself and say: &ldquo;There is coal there; I will not give it up; and coal or
      no coal I will drive the tunnel clear through the hill; I will not
      surrender while I am alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He never thought of asking Mr. Montague for more money. He said there was
      now but one chance of finding coal against nine hundred and ninety nine
      that he would not find it, and so it would be wrong in him to make the
      request and foolish in Mr. Montague to grant it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been working three shifts of men. Finally, the settling of a weekly
      account exhausted his means. He could not afford to run in debt, and
      therefore he gave the men their discharge. They came into his cabin
      presently, where he sat with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his
      hands&mdash;the picture of discouragement and their spokesman said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Sterling, when Tim was down a week with his fall you kept him on
      half-wages and it was a mighty help to his family; whenever any of us was
      in trouble you&rsquo;ve done what you could to help us out; you&rsquo;ve acted fair
      and square with us every time, and I reckon we are men and know a man when
      we see him. We haven&rsquo;t got any faith in that hill, but we have a respect
      for a man that&rsquo;s got the pluck that you&rsquo;ve showed; you&rsquo;ve fought a good
      fight, with everybody agin you and if we had grub to go on, I&rsquo;m d&mdash;&mdash;d
      if we wouldn&rsquo;t stand by you till the cows come home! That is what the boys
      say. Now we want to put in one parting blast for luck. We want to work
      three days more; if we don&rsquo;t find anything, we won&rsquo;t bring in no bill
      against you. That is what we&rsquo;ve come to say.&rdquo;

      Philip was touched. If he had had money enough to buy three days&rsquo; &ldquo;grub&rdquo;
       he would have accepted the generous offer, but as it was, he could not
      consent to be less magnanimous than the men, and so he declined in a manly
      speech; shook hands all around and resumed his solitary communings. The
      men went back to the tunnel and &ldquo;put in a parting blast for luck&rdquo; anyhow.
      They did a full day&rsquo;s work and then took their leave. They called at his
      cabin and gave him good-bye, but were not able to tell him their day&rsquo;s
      effort had given things a mere promising look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Philip sold all the tools but two or three sets; he also sold
      one of the now deserted cabins as old, lumber, together with its domestic
      wares; and made up his mind that he would buy provisions with the trifle
      of money thus gained and continue his work alone. About the middle of the
      afternoon he put on his roughest clothes and went to the tunnel. He lit a
      candle and groped his way in. Presently he heard the sound of a pick or a
      drill, and wondered, what it meant. A spark of light now appeared in the
      far end of the tunnel, and when he arrived there he found the man Tim at
      work. Tim said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m to have a job in the Golden Brier mine by and by&mdash;in a week or
      ten days&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to work here till then. A man might as well
      be at some thing, and besides I consider that I owe you what you paid me
      when I was laid up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Philip said, Oh, no, he didn&rsquo;t owe anything; but Tim persisted, and then
      Philip said he had a little provision now, and would share. So for several
      days Philip held the drill and Tim did the striking. At first Philip was
      impatient to see the result of every blast, and was always back and
      peering among the smoke the moment after the explosion. But there was
      never any encouraging result; and therefore he finally lost almost all
      interest, and hardly troubled himself to inspect results at all. He simply
      labored on, stubbornly and with little hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim staid with him till the last moment, and then took up his job at the
      Golden Brier, apparently as depressed by the continued barrenness of their
      mutual labors as Philip was himself. After that, Philip fought his battle
      alone, day after day, and slow work it was; he could scarcely see that he
      made any progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late one afternoon he finished drilling a hole which he had been at work
      at for more than two hours; he swabbed it out, and poured in the powder
      and inserted the fuse; then filled up the rest of the hole with dirt and
      small fragments of stone; tamped it down firmly, touched his candle to the
      fuse, and ran.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by the dull report came, and he was about to walk back mechanically
      and see what was accomplished; but he halted; presently turned on his heel
      and thought, rather than said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, this is useless, this is absurd. If I found anything it would only be
      one of those little aggravating seams of coal which doesn&rsquo;t mean anything,
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time he was walking out of the tunnel. His thought ran on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am conquered . . . . . . I am out of provisions, out of money. . . . I
      have got to give it up . . . . . . All this hard work lost! But I am not
      conquered! I will go and work for money, and come back and have another
      fight with fate. Ah me, it may be years, it may, be years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the mouth of the tunnel, he threw his coat upon the ground, sat
      down on a stone, and his eye sought the westering sun and dwelt upon the
      charming landscape which stretched its woody ridges, wave upon wave, to
      the golden horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something was taking place at his feet which did not attract his
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      His reverie continued, and its burden grew more and more gloomy. Presently
      he rose up and, cast a look far away toward the valley, and his thoughts
      took a new direction:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is! How good it looks! But down there is not up here. Well, I
      will go home and pack up&mdash;there is nothing else to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved off moodily toward his cabin. He had gone some distance before he
      thought of his coat; then he was about to turn back, but he smiled at the
      thought, and continued his journey&mdash;such a coat as that could be of
      little use in a civilized land; a little further on, he remembered that
      there were some papers of value in one of the pockets of the relic, and
      then with a penitent ejaculation he turned back picked up the coat and put
      it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a dozen steps, and then stopped very suddenly. He stood still a
      moment, as one who is trying to believe something and cannot. He put a
      hand up over his shoulder and felt his back, and a great thrill shot
      through him. He grasped the skirt of the coat impulsively and another
      thrill followed. He snatched the coat from his back, glanced at it, threw
      it from him and flew back to the tunnel. He sought the spot where the coat
      had lain&mdash;he had to look close, for the light was waning&mdash;then
      to make sure, he put his hand to the ground and a little stream of water
      swept against his fingers:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, I&rsquo;ve struck it at last!&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He lit a candle and ran into the tunnel; he picked up a piece of rubbish
      cast out by the last blast, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This clayey stuff is what I&rsquo;ve longed for&mdash;I know what is behind
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He swung his pick with hearty good will till long after the darkness had
      gathered upon the earth, and when he trudged home at length he knew he had
      a coal vein and that it was seven feet thick from wall to wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found a yellow envelope lying on his rickety table, and recognized that
      it was of a family sacred to the transmission of telegrams.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened it, read it, crushed it in his hand and threw it down. It simply
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth is very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p>
      It was evening when Philip took the cars at the Ilium station. The news of
      his success had preceded him, and while he waited for the train, he was
      the center of a group of eager questioners, who asked him a hundred things
      about the mine, and magnified his good fortune. There was no mistake this
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip, in luck, had become suddenly a person of consideration, whose
      speech was freighted with meaning, whose looks were all significant. The
      words of the proprietor of a rich coal mine have a golden sound, and his
      common sayings are repeated as if they were solid wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip wished to be alone; his good fortune at this moment seemed an empty
      mockery, one of those sarcasms of fate, such as that which spreads a
      dainty banquet for the man who has no appetite. He had longed for success
      principally for Ruth&rsquo;s sake; and perhaps now, at this very moment of his
      triumph, she was dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shust what I said, Mister Sederling,&rdquo; the landlord of the Ilium hotel
      kept repeating. &ldquo;I dold Jake Schmidt he find him dere shust so sure as
      noting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have taken a share, Mr. Dusenheimer,&rdquo; said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yaas, I know. But d&rsquo;old woman, she say &lsquo;You sticks to your pisiness. So I
      sticks to &lsquo;em. Und I makes noting. Dat Mister Prierly, he don&rsquo;t never come
      back here no more, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vell, dere is so many peers, and so many oder dhrinks, I got &lsquo;em all set
      down, ven he coomes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p568" id="p568"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p568.jpg (39K)" src="images/p568.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long night for Philip, and a restless one. At any other time the
      swing of the cars would have lulled him to sleep, and the rattle and clank
      of wheels and rails, the roar of the whirling iron would have only been
      cheerful reminders of swift and safe travel. Now they were voices of
      warning and taunting; and instead of going rapidly the train seemed to
      crawl at a snail&rsquo;s pace. And it not only crawled, but it frequently
      stopped; and when it stopped it stood dead still and there was an ominous
      silence. Was anything the matter, he wondered. Only a station probably.
      Perhaps, he thought, a telegraphic station. And then he listened eagerly.
      Would the conductor open the door and ask for Philip Sterling, and hand
      him a fatal dispatch?
    </p>
    <p>
      How long they seemed to wait. And then slowly beginning to move, they were
      off again, shaking, pounding, screaming through the night. He drew his
      curtain from time to time and looked out. There was the lurid sky line of
      the wooded range along the base of which they were crawling. There was the
      Susquehannah, gleaming in the moon-light. There was a stretch of level
      valley with silent farm houses, the occupants all at rest, without
      trouble, without anxiety. There was a church, a graveyard, a mill, a
      village; and now, without pause or fear, the train had mounted a
      trestle-work high in air and was creeping along the top of it while a
      swift torrent foamed a hundred feet below.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would the morning bring? Even while he was flying to her, her gentle
      spirit might have gone on another flight, whither he could not follow her.
      He was full of foreboding. He fell at length into a restless doze. There
      was a noise in his ears as of a rushing torrent when a stream is swollen
      by a freshet in the spring. It was like the breaking up of life; he was
      struggling in the consciousness of coming death: when Ruth stood by his
      side, clothed in white, with a face like that of an angel, radiant,
      smiling, pointing to the sky, and saying, &ldquo;Come.&rdquo; He awoke with a cry&mdash;the
      train was roaring through a bridge, and it shot out into daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      When morning came the train was industriously toiling along through the
      fat lands of Lancaster, with its broad farms of corn and wheat, its mean
      houses of stone, its vast barns and granaries, built as if, for storing
      the riches of Heliogabalus. Then came the smiling fields of Chester, with
      their English green, and soon the county of Philadelphia itself, and the
      increasing signs of the approach to a great city. Long trains of coal
      cars, laden and unladen, stood upon sidings; the tracks of other roads
      were crossed; the smoke of other locomotives was seen on parallel lines;
      factories multiplied; streets appeared; the noise of a busy city began to
      fill the air;&mdash;and with a slower and slower clank on the connecting
      rails and interlacing switches the train rolled into the station and stood
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a hot August morning. The broad streets glowed in the sun, and the
      white-shuttered houses stared at the hot thoroughfares like closed bakers&rsquo;
      ovens set along the highway. Philip was oppressed with the heavy air; the
      sweltering city lay as in a swoon. Taking a street car, he rode away to
      the northern part of the city, the newer portion, formerly the district of
      Spring Garden, for in this the Boltons now lived, in a small brick house,
      befitting their altered fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could scarcely restrain his impatience when he came in sight of the
      house. The window shutters were not &ldquo;bowed&rdquo;; thank God, for that. Ruth was
      still living, then. He ran up the steps and rang. Mrs. Bolton met him at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thee is very welcome, Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Ruth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is very ill, but quieter than she has been, and the fever is a little
      abating. The most dangerous time will be when the fever leaves her. The
      doctor fears she will not have strength enough to rally from it. Yes, thee
      can see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bolton led the way to the little chamber where Ruth lay. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said
      her mother, &ldquo;if she were only in her cool and spacious room in our old
      home. She says that seems like heaven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bolton sat by Ruth&rsquo;s bedside, and he rose and silently pressed
      Philip&rsquo;s hand. The room had but one window; that was wide open to admit
      the air, but the air that came in was hot and lifeless. Upon the table
      stood a vase of flowers. Ruth&rsquo;s eyes were closed; her cheeks were flushed
      with fever, and she moved her head restlessly as if in pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; said her mother, bending over her, &ldquo;Philip is here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth&rsquo;s eyes unclosed, there was a gleam of recognition in them, there was
      an attempt at a smile upon her face, and she tried to raise her thin hand,
      as Philip touched her forehead with his lips; and he heard her murmur,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Phil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p571" id="p571"></a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:60%;">
      <img alt="p571.jpg (66K)" src="images/p571.jpg" style="width:100%;"  /><br />
    </div>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to be done but to watch and wait for the cruel fever to
      burn itself out. Dr. Longstreet told Philip that the fever had undoubtedly
      been contracted in the hospital, but it was not malignant, and would be
      little dangerous if Ruth were not so worn down with work, or if she had a
      less delicate constitution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only her indomitable will that has kept her up for weeks. And if
      that should leave her now, there will be no hope. You can do more for her
      now, sir, than I can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Philip eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your presence, more than anything else, will inspire her with the desire
      to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the fever turned, Ruth was in a very critical condition. For two days
      her life was like the fluttering of a lighted candle in the wind. Philip
      was constantly by her side, and she seemed to be conscious of his
      presence, and to cling to him, as one borne away by a swift stream clings
      to a stretched-out hand from the shore. If he was absent a moment her
      restless eyes sought something they were disappointed not to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip so yearned to bring her back to life, he willed it so strongly and
      passionately, that his will appeared to affect hers and she seemed slowly
      to draw life from his.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two days of this struggle with the grasping enemy, it was evident to
      Dr. Longstreet that Ruth&rsquo;s will was beginning to issue its orders to her
      body with some force, and that strength was slowly coming back. In another
      day there was a decided improvement. As Philip sat holding her weak hand
      and watching the least sign of resolution in her face, Ruth was able to
      whisper,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I so want to live, for you, Phil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will; darling, you must,&rdquo; said Philip in a tone of faith and courage
      that carried a thrill of determination&mdash;of command&mdash;along all
      her nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Philip drew her back to life. Slowly she came back, as one willing
      but well nigh helpless. It was new for Ruth to feel this dependence on
      another&rsquo;s nature, to consciously draw strength of will from the will of
      another. It was a new but a dear joy, to be lifted up and carried back
      into the happy world, which was now all aglow with the light of love; to
      be lifted and carried by the one she loved more than her own life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetheart,&rdquo; she said to Philip, &ldquo;I would not have cared to come back but
      for thy love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for thy profession?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thee may be glad enough of that some day, when thy coal bed is dug
      out and thee and father are in the air again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Ruth was able to ride she was taken into the country, for the pure
      air was necessary to her speedy recovery. The family went with her. Philip
      could not be spared from her side, and Mr. Bolton had gone up to Ilium to
      look into that wonderful coal mine and to make arrangements for developing
      it, and bringing its wealth to market. Philip had insisted on re-conveying
      the Ilium property to Mr. Bolton, retaining only the share originally
      contemplated for himself, and Mr. Bolton, therefore, once more found
      himself engaged in business and a person of some consequence in Third
      street. The mine turned out even better than was at first hoped, and
      would, if judiciously managed, be a fortune to them all. This also seemed
      to be the opinion of Mr. Bigler, who heard of it as soon as anybody, and,
      with the impudence of his class called upon Mr. Bolton for a little aid in
      a patent car-wheel he had bought an interest in. That rascal, Small, he
      said, had swindled him out of all he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bolton told him he was very sorry, and recommended him to sue Small.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Small also came with a similar story about Mr. Bigler; and Mr. Bolton
      had the grace to give him like advice. And he added, &ldquo;If you and Bigler
      will procure the indictment of each other, you may have the satisfaction
      of putting each other in the penitentiary for the forgery of my
      acceptances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bigler and Small did not quarrel however. They both attacked Mr. Bolton
      behind his back as a swindler, and circulated the story that he had made a
      fortune by failing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pure air of the highlands, amid the golden glories of ripening
      September, Ruth rapidly came back to health. How beautiful the world is to
      an invalid, whose senses are all clarified, who has been so near the world
      of spirits that she is sensitive to the finest influences, and whose frame
      responds with a thrill to the subtlest ministrations of soothing nature.
      Mere life is a luxury, and the color of the grass, of the flowers, of the
      sky, the wind in the trees, the outlines of the horizon, the forms of
      clouds, all give a pleasure as exquisite as the sweetest music to the ear
      famishing for it. The world was all new and fresh to Ruth, as if it had
      just been created for her, and love filled it, till her heart was
      overflowing with happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was golden September also at Fallkill. And Alice sat by the open window
      in her room at home, looking out upon the meadows where the laborers were
      cutting the second crop of clover. The fragrance of it floated to her
      nostrils. Perhaps she did not mind it. She was thinking. She had just been
      writing to Ruth, and on the table before her was a yellow piece of paper
      with a faded four-leaved clover pinned on it&mdash;only a memory now. In
      her letter to Ruth she had poured out her heartiest blessings upon them
      both, with her dear love forever and forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;they will never know&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <a name="p573" id="p573"></a>

    <p>
      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They never would know. And the world never knows how many women there are
      like Alice, whose sweet but lonely lives of self-sacrifice, gentle,
      faithful, loving souls, bless it continually.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a dear girl,&rdquo; said Philip, when Ruth showed him the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Phil, and we can spare a great deal of love for her, our own lives
      are so full.&rdquo;

      Perhaps some apology to the reader is necessary in view of our failure to
      find Laura&rsquo;s father. We supposed, from the ease with which lost persons
      are found in novels, that it would not be difficult. But it was; indeed,
      it was impossible; and therefore the portions of the narrative containing
      the record of the search have been stricken out. Not because they were not
      interesting&mdash;for they were; but inasmuch as the man was not found,
      after all, it did not seem wise to harass and excite the reader to no
      purpose.

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
