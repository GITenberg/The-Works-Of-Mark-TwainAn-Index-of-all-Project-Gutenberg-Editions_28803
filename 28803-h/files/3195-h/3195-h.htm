<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The Monday Evening Club of Hartford was an association of most of
     the literary talent of that city, and it included a number of very
     distinguished members.  The writers, the editors, the lawyers, and
     the ministers of the gospel who composed it were more often than not
     men of national or international distinction.  There was but one
     paper at each meeting, and it was likely to be a paper that would
     later find its way into some magazine.

     Naturally Mark Twain was one of its favorite members, and his
     contributions never failed to arouse interest and discussion.  A
     &ldquo;Mark Twain night&rdquo; brought out every member.  In the next letter we
     find the first mention of one of his most memorable contributions&mdash;a
     story of one of life&rsquo;s moral aspects.  The tale, now included in his
     collected works, is, for some reason, little read to-day; yet the
     curious allegory, so vivid in its seeming reality, is well worth
     consideration.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                             HARTFORD, Jan. 11, &lsquo;76.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Indeed we haven&rsquo;t forgotten the Howellses,
      nor scored up a grudge of any kind against them; but the fact is I was
      under the doctor&rsquo;s hands for four weeks on a stretch and have been
      disabled from working for a week or so beside. I thought I was well, about
      ten days ago, so I sent for a short-hand writer and dictated answers to a
      bushel or so of letters that had been accumulating during my illness.
      Getting everything shipshape and cleared up, I went to work next day upon
      an Atlantic article, which ought to be worth $20 per page (which is the
      price they usually pay for my work, I believe) for although it is only 70
      pages MS (less than two days work, counting by bulk,) I have spent 3 more
      days trimming, altering and working at it. I shall put in one more day&rsquo;s
      polishing on it, and then read it before our Club, which is to meet at our
      house Monday evening, the 24th inst. I think it will bring out
      considerable discussion among the gentlemen of the Club&mdash;though the
      title of the article will not give them much notion of what is to follow,&mdash;this
      title being &ldquo;The Facts Concerning the Recent Carnival of Crime in
      Connecticut&rdquo;&mdash;which reminds me that today&rsquo;s Tribune says
      there will be a startling article in the current Atlantic, in which a
      being which is tangible bud invisible will figure-exactly the case with
      the sketch of mine which I am talking about! However, mine can lie
      unpublished a year or two as well as not&mdash;though I wish that
      contributor of yours had not interfered with his coincidence of heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what I am coming at, is this: won&rsquo;t you and Mrs. Howells come
      down Saturday the 22nd and remain to the Club on Monday night? We always
      have a rattling good time at the Club and we do want you to come, ever so
      much. Will you? Now say you will. Mrs. Clemens and I are persuading
      ourselves that you twain will come.
    </p>
    <p>
      My volume of sketches is doing very well, considering the times; received
      my quarterly statement today from Bliss, by which I perceive that 20,000
      copies have been sold&mdash;or rather, 20,000 had been sold 3 weeks ago; a
      lot more, by this time, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am on the sick list again&mdash;and was, day before yesterday&mdash;but
      on the whole I am getting along.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              Yrs ever

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Howells wrote that he could not come down to the club meeting,
     adding that sickness was &ldquo;quite out of character&rdquo; for Mark Twain,
     and hardly fair on a man who had made so many other people feel
     well.  He closed by urging that Bliss &ldquo;hurry out&rdquo; &lsquo;Tom Sawyer.&rsquo;
     &ldquo;That boy is going to make a prodigious hit.&rdquo;  Clemens answered:

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                             HARTFORD, Jan. 18, &lsquo;76.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Thanks, and ever so many, for the good opinion of
      &lsquo;Tom Sawyer.&rsquo; Williams has made about 300 rattling pictures
      for it&mdash;some of them very dainty. Poor devil, what a genius he has
      and how he does murder it with rum. He takes a book of mine, and without
      suggestion from anybody builds no end of pictures just from his reading of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was never a man in the world so grateful to another as I was to you
      day before yesterday, when I sat down (in still rather wretched health) to
      set myself to the dreary and hateful task of making final revision of Tom
      Sawyer, and discovered, upon opening the package of MS that your pencil
      marks were scattered all along. This was splendid, and swept away all
      labor. Instead of reading the MS, I simply hunted out the pencil marks and
      made the emendations which they suggested. I reduced the boy battle to a
      curt paragraph; I finally concluded to cut the Sunday school speech down
      to the first two sentences, leaving no suggestion of satire, since the
      book is to be for boys and girls; I tamed the various obscenities until I
      judged that they no longer carried offense. So, at a single sitting I
      began and finished a revision which I had supposed would occupy 3 or 4.
      days and leave me mentally and physically fagged out at the end. I was
      careful not to inflict the MS upon you until I had thoroughly and
      painstakingly revised it. Therefore, the only faults left were those that
      would discover themselves to others, not me&mdash;and these you had
      pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one expression which perhaps you overlooked. When Huck is
      complaining to Tom of the rigorous system in vogue at the widow&rsquo;s,
      he says the servants harass him with all manner of compulsory decencies,
      and he winds up by saying: &ldquo;and they comb me all to hell.&rdquo; (No
      exclamation point.) Long ago, when I read that to Mrs. Clemens, she made
      no comment; another time I created occasion to read that chapter to her
      aunt and her mother (both sensitive and loyal subjects of the kingdom of
      heaven, so to speak) and they let it pass. I was glad, for it was the most
      natural remark in the world for that boy to make (and he had been allowed
      few privileges of speech in the book;) when I saw that you, too, had let
      it go without protest, I was glad, and afraid; too&mdash;afraid you hadn&rsquo;t
      observed it. Did you? And did you question the propriety of it? Since the
      book is now professedly and confessedly a boy&rsquo;s and girl&rsquo;s
      hook, that darn word bothers me some, nights, but it never did until I had
      ceased to regard the volume as being for adults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t bother to answer now, (for you&rsquo;ve writing enough to do
      without allowing me to add to the burden,) but tell me when you see me
      again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Which we do hope will be next Saturday or Sunday or Monday. Couldn&rsquo;t
      you come now and mull over the alterations which you are going to make in
      your MS, and make them after you go back? Wouldn&rsquo;t it assist the
      work if you dropped out of harness and routine for a day or two and have
      that sort of revivification which comes of a holiday-forgetfulness of the
      work-shop? I can always work after I&rsquo;ve been to your house; and if
      you will come to mine, now, and hear the club toot their various horns
      over the exasperating metaphysical question which I mean to lay before
      them in the disguise of a literary extravaganza, it would just brace you
      up like a cordial.
    </p>
    <p>
      (I feel sort of mean trying to persuade a man to put down a critical piece
      of work at a critical time, but yet I am honest in thinking it would not
      hurt the work nor impair your interest in it to come under the
      circumstances.) Mrs. Clemens says, &ldquo;Maybe the Howellses could come
      Monday if they cannot come Saturday; ask them; it is worth trying.&rdquo;
      Well, how&rsquo;s that? Could you? It would be splendid if you could. Drop
      me a postal card&mdash;I should have a twinge of conscience if I forced
      you to write a letter, (I am honest about that,)&mdash;and if you find you
      can&rsquo;t make out to come, tell me that you bodies will come the next
      Saturday if the thing is possible, and stay over Sunday.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                   Yrs ever
                                             MARK.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Howells, however, did not come to the club meeting, but promised to
     come soon when they could have a quiet time to themselves together.
     As to Huck&rsquo;s language, he declared:

     &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have that swearing out in an instant.  I suppose I didn&rsquo;t
     notice it because the locution was so familiar to my Western sense,
     and so exactly the thing that Huck would say.&rdquo;  Clemens changed the
     phrase to, &ldquo;They comb me all to thunder,&rdquo; and so it stands to-day.

     The &ldquo;Carnival of Crime,&rdquo; having served its purpose at the club,
     found quick acceptance by Howells for the Atlantic.  He was so
     pleased with it, in fact, that somewhat later he wrote, urging that
     its author allow it to be printed in a dainty book, by Osgood, who
     made a specialty of fine publishing.  Meantime Howells had written
     his Atlantic notice of Tom Sawyer, and now inclosed Clemens a proof
     of it.  We may judge from the reply that it was satisfactory.

      To W. D. Howells, in Boston:

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                                  Apl 3, &lsquo;76.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;It is a splendid notice and will embolden
      weak-kneed journalistic admirers to speak out, and will modify or shut up
      the unfriendly. To &ldquo;fear God and dread the Sunday school&rdquo;
      exactly described that old feeling which I used to have, but I couldn&rsquo;t
      have formulated it. I want to enclose one of the illustrations in this
      letter, if I do not forget it. Of course the book is to be elaborately
      illustrated, and I think that many of the pictures are considerably above
      the American average, in conception if not in execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not re-enclose your review to you, for you have evidently read and
      corrected it, and so I judge you do not need it. About two days after the
      Atlantic issues I mean to begin to send books to principal journals and
      magazines.
    </p>
    <p>
      I read the &ldquo;Carnival of Crime&rdquo; proof in New York when worn and
      witless and so left some things unamended which I might possibly have
      altered had I been at home. For instance, &ldquo;I shall always address
      you in your own S-n-i-v-e-l-i-n-g d-r-a-w-l, baby.&rdquo; I saw that you
      objected to something there, but I did not understand what! Was it that it
      was too personal? Should the language be altered?&mdash;or the hyphens
      taken out? Won&rsquo;t you please fix it the way it ought to be, altering
      the language as you choose, only making it bitter and contemptuous?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deuced&rdquo; was not strong enough; so I met you halfway with
      &ldquo;devilish.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clemens has returned from New York with dreadful sore throat, and
      bones racked with rheumatism. She keeps her bed. &ldquo;Aloha nui!&rdquo;
      as the Kanakas say. MARK.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Henry Irving once said to Mark Twain: &ldquo;You made a mistake by not
     adopting the stage as a profession.  You would have made even a
     greater actor than a writer.&rdquo;

     Mark Twain would have made an actor, certainly, but not a very
     tractable one.  His appearance in Hartford in &ldquo;The Loan of a Lover&rdquo;
      was a distinguished event, and his success complete, though he made
     so many extemporaneous improvements on the lines of thick-headed
     Peter Spuyk, that he kept the other actors guessing as to their
     cues, and nearly broke up the performance.  It was, of course, an
     amateur benefit, though Augustin Daly promptly wrote, offering to
     put it on for a long run.

     The &ldquo;skeleton novelette&rdquo; mentioned in the next letter refers to a
     plan concocted by Howells and Clemens, by which each of twelve
     authors was to write a story, using the same plot, &ldquo;blindfolded&rdquo; as
     to what the others had written.  It was a regular &ldquo;Mark Twain&rdquo;
      notion, and it is hard to-day to imagine Howells&rsquo;s continued
     enthusiasm in it.  Neither he nor Clemens gave up the idea for a
     long time.  It appears in their letters again and again, though
     perhaps it was just as well for literature that it was never carried
     out.

     In his next letter Mark Twain explains why Tom Sawyer is not to
     appear as soon as planned.  The reference to &ldquo;The Literary
     Nightmare&rdquo; refers to the &ldquo;Punch, Conductor, Punch with Care&rdquo; sketch,
     which had recently appeared in the Atlantic.  Many other versifiers
     had had their turn at horse-car poetry, and now a publisher was
     anxious to collect it in a book, provided he could use the Atlantic
     sketch.  Clemens does not tell us here the nature of Carlton&rsquo;s
     insult, forgiveness of which he was not yet qualified to grant, but
     there are at least two stories about it, or two halves of the same
     incident, as related afterward by Clemens and Canton.  Clemens said
     that when he took the Jumping Frog book to Carlton, in 1867, the
     latter, pointing to his stock, said, rather scornfully: &ldquo;Books?
     I don&rsquo;t want your book; my shelves are full of books now,&rdquo; though
     the reader may remember that it was Carlton himself who had given
     the frog story to the Saturday Press and had seen it become famous.
     Carlton&rsquo;s half of the story was that he did not accept Mark Twain&rsquo;s
     book because the author looked so disreputable.  Long afterward,
     when the two men met in Europe, the publisher said to the now rich
     and famous author: &ldquo;Mr. Clemens, my one claim on immortality is that
     I declined your first book.&rdquo;

      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Thanks for giving me the place of honor.

    <p>
      Bliss made a failure in the matter of getting Tom Sawyer ready on time&mdash;the
      engravers assisting, as usual. I went down to see how much of a delay
      there was going to be, and found that the man had not even put a canvasser
      on, or issued an advertisement yet&mdash;in fact, that the electrotypes
      would not all be done for a month! But of course the main fact was that no
      canvassing had been done&mdash;because a subscription harvest is before
      publication, (not after, when people have discovered how bad one&rsquo;s
      book is.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, yesterday I put in the Courant an editorial paragraph stating that
      Tam Sawyer is &ldquo;ready to issue, but publication is put off in order
      to secure English copyright by simultaneous publication there and here.
      The English edition is unavoidably delayed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      You see, part of that is true. Very well. When I observed that my &ldquo;Sketches&rdquo;
      had dropped from a sale of 6 or 7000 a month down to 1200 a month, I said
      &ldquo;this ain&rsquo;t no time to be publishing books; therefore, let Tom
      lie still till Autumn, Mr. Bliss, and make a holiday book of him to
      beguile the young people withal.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall print items occasionally, still further delaying Tom, till I ease
      him down to Autumn without shock to the waiting world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to that &ldquo;Literary Nightmare&rdquo; proposition. I&rsquo;m obliged
      to withhold consent, for what seems a good reason&mdash;to wit: A single
      page of horse-car poetry is all that the average reader can stand, without
      nausea; now, to stack together all of it that has been written, and then
      add it to my article would be to enrage and disgust each and every reader
      and win the deathless enmity of the lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if that reason were insufficient, there would still be a sufficient
      reason left, in the fact that Mr. Carlton seems to be the publisher of the
      magazine in which it is proposed to publish this horse-car matter. Carlton
      insulted me in Feb. 1867, and so when the day arrives that sees me doing
      him a civility I shall feel that I am ready for Paradise, since my list of
      possible and impossible forgivenesses will then be complete.

      Mrs. Clemens says my version of the blindfold novelette &ldquo;A Murder

     The mention of Anna Dickinson, at the end of this letter, recalls a
     prominent reformer and lecturer of the Civil War period.  She had
     begun her crusades against temperance and slavery in 1857, when she
     was but fifteen years old, when her success as a speaker had been
     immediate and extraordinary.  Now, in this later period, at the age
     of thirty-four, she aspired to the stage&mdash;unfortunately for her, as
     her gifts lay elsewhere.  Clemens and Howells knew Miss Dickinson,
     and were anxious for the success which they hardly dared hope for.
     Clemens arranged a box party.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I shall reach Boston on Monday the 8th, either at
      4:30 p.m. or 6 p.m. (Which is best?) and go straight to Parker&rsquo;s. If
      you and Mrs. Howells cannot be there by half past 4, I&rsquo;ll not plan
      to arrive till the later train-time (6,) because I don&rsquo;t want to be
      there alone&mdash;even a minute. Still, Joe Twichell will doubtless go
      with me (forgot that,) he is going to try hard to. Mrs. Clemens has given
      up going, because Susy is just recovering from about the savagest assault
      of diphtheria a child ever did recover from, and therefore will not be
      entirely her healthy self again by the 8th.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would you and Mrs. Howells like to invite Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich? I have a
      large proscenium box&mdash;plenty of room. Use your own pleasure about it&mdash;I
      mainly (that is honest,) suggest it because I am seeking to make matters
      pleasant for you and Mrs. Howells. I invited Twichell because I thought I
      knew you&rsquo;d like that. I want you to fix it so that you and the Madam
      can remain in Boston all night; for I leave next day and we can&rsquo;t
      have a talk, otherwise. I am going to get two rooms and a parlor; and
      would like to know what you decide about the Aldriches, so as to know
      whether to apply for an additional bedroom or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t dine that evening, for I shall arrive dinnerless and need your
      help.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll bring my Blindfold Novelette, but shan&rsquo;t exhibit it
      unless you exhibit yours. You would simply go to work and write a
      novelette that would make mine sick. Because you would know all about
      where my weak points lay. No, Sir, I&rsquo;m one of these old wary birds!

      journalistic folks. But I&rsquo;m most honestly glad, for I&rsquo;d rather
      pay three prices, any time, than to have my tongue half paralyzed with a
      dead-head ticket.

    <p>
      Hang that Anna Dickinson, a body can never depend upon her debuts! She has
      made five or six false starts already. If she fails to debut this time, I
      will never bet on her again.

     In his book, My Mark Twain, Howells refers to the &ldquo;tragedy&rdquo; of Miss

      DEAR FRIEND THE DOCTOR,&mdash;It was a perfect delight to see the
      well-known handwriting again! But we so grieve to know that you are
      feeling miserable. It must not last&mdash;it cannot last. The regal summer
      is come and it will smile you into high good cheer; it will charm away

      the summer with us. We are perched on a hill-top that overlooks a little
      world of green valleys, shining rivers, sumptuous forests and billowy
      uplands veiled in the haze of distance. We have no neighbors. It is the
      quietest of all quiet places, and we are hermits that eschew caves and
      live in the sun. Doctor, if you&rsquo;d only come!

      I will carry your letter to Mrs. C. now, and there will be a glad woman, I

     From May until August no letters appear to have passed between
     Clemens and Howells; the latter finally wrote, complaining of the
     lack of news.  He was in the midst of campaign activities, he said,
     writing a life of Hayes, and gaily added: &ldquo;You know I wrote the life
     of Lincoln, which elected him.&rdquo;  He further reported a comedy he had
     completed, and gave Clemens a general stirring up as to his own
     work.

     Mark Twain, in his hillside study, was busy enough.  Summer was his
     time for work, and he had tried his hand in various directions.  His
     mention of Huck Finn in his reply to Howells is interesting, in that
     it shows the measure of his enthusiasm, or lack of it, as a gauge of
     his ultimate achievement

    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I was just about to write you when your letter came&mdash;and
      not one of those obscene postal cards, either, but reverently, upon paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall read that biography, though the letter of acceptance was amply
      sufficient to corral my vote without any further knowledge of the man.
      Which reminds me that a campaign club in Jersey City wrote a few days ago
      and invited me to be present at the raising of a Tilden and Hendricks flag
      there, and to take the stand and give them some &ldquo;counsel.&rdquo;
      Well, I could not go, but gave them counsel and advice by letter, and in
      the kindliest terms as to the raising of the flag&mdash;advised them
      &ldquo;not to raise it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Get your book out quick, for this is a momentous time. If Tilden is
      elected I think the entire country will go pretty straight to&mdash;Mrs.
      Howells&rsquo;s bad place.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am infringing on your patent&mdash;I started a record of our children&rsquo;s
      sayings, last night. Which reminds me that last week I sent down and got
      Susie a vast pair of shoes of a most villainous pattern, for I discovered
      that her feet were being twisted and cramped out of shape by a smaller and
      prettier article. She did not complain, but looked degraded and injured.
      At night her mamma gave her the usual admonition when she was about to say
      her prayers&mdash;to wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Susie&mdash;think about God.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mamma, I can&rsquo;t, with those shoes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The farm is perfectly delightful this season. It is as quiet and peaceful
      as a South Sea Island. Some of the sunsets which we have witnessed from
      this commanding eminence were marvelous. One evening a rainbow spanned an
      entire range of hills with its mighty arch, and from a black hub resting
      upon the hill-top in the exact centre, black rays diverged upward in
      perfect regularity to the rainbow&rsquo;s arch and created a very strongly
      defined and altogether the most majestic, magnificent and startling
      half-sunk wagon wheel you can imagine. After that, a world of tumbling and
      prodigious clouds came drifting up out of the West and took to themselves
      a wonderfully rich and brilliant green color&mdash;the decided green of
      new spring foliage. Close by them we saw the intense blue of the skies,
      through rents in the cloud-rack, and away off in another quarter were
      drifting clouds of a delicate pink color. In one place hung a pall of
      dense black clouds, like compacted pitch-smoke. And the stupendous wagon
      wheel was still in the supremacy of its unspeakable grandeur. So you see,
      the colors present in the sky at once and the same time were blue, green,
      pink, black, and the vari-colored splendors of the rainbow. All strong and
      decided colors, too. I don&rsquo;t know whether this weird and astounding
      spectacle most suggested heaven, or hell. The wonder, with its constant,
      stately, and always surprising changes, lasted upwards of two hours, and
      we all stood on the top of the hill by my study till the final miracle was
      complete and the greatest day ended that we ever saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our farmer, who is a grave man, watched that spectacle to the end, and
      then observed that it was &ldquo;dam funny.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The double-barreled novel lies torpid. I found I could not go on with it.
      The chapters I had written were still too new and familiar to me. I may
      take it up next winter, but cannot tell yet; I waited and waited to see if
      my interest in it would not revive, but gave it up a month ago and began
      another boys&rsquo; book&mdash;more to be at work than anything else. I
      have written 400 pages on it&mdash;therefore it is very nearly half done.
      It is Huck Finn&rsquo;s Autobiography. I like it only tolerably well, as
      far as I have got, and may possibly pigeonhole or burn the MS when it is
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the comedy is done, and with a &ldquo;fair degree of satisfaction.&rdquo;
      That rejoices me, and makes me mad, too&mdash;for I can&rsquo;t plan a
      comedy, and what have you done that God should be so good to you? I have
      racked myself baldheaded trying to plan a comedy harness for some
      promising characters of mine to work in, and had to give it up. It is a
      noble lot of blooded stock and worth no end of money, but they must stand
      in the stable and be profitless. I want to be present when the comedy is
      produced and help enjoy the success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warner&rsquo;s book is mighty readable, I think.

    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I am glad you think I could do Hayes any good, for
      I have been wanting to write a letter or make a speech to that end. I&rsquo;ll
      be careful not to do either, however, until the opportunity comes in a
      natural, justifiable and unlugged way; and shall not then do anything
      unless I&rsquo;ve got it all digested and worded just right. In which case
      I might do some good&mdash;in any other I should do harm. When a humorist
      ventures upon the grave concerns of life he must do his job better than
      another man or he works harm to his cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farce is wonderfully bright and delicious, and must make a hit. You
      read it to me, and it was mighty good; I read it last night and it was
      better; I read it aloud to the household this morning and it was better
      than ever. So it would be worth going a long way to see it well played;
      for without any question an actor of genius always adds a subtle something
      to any man&rsquo;s work that none but the writer knew was there before.
      Even if he knew it. I have heard of readers convulsing audiences with my
      &ldquo;Aurelia&rsquo;s Unfortunate Young Man.&rdquo; If there is anything
      really funny in the piece, the author is not aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All right&mdash;advertise me for the new volume. I send you herewith a
      sketch which will make 3 pages of the Atlantic. If you like it and accept
      it, you should get it into the December No. because I shall read it in
      public in Boston the 13th and 14th of Nov. If it went in a month earlier
      it would be too old for me to read except as old matter; and if it went in
      a month later it would be too old for the Atlantic&mdash;do you see? And
      if you wish to use it, will you set it up now, and send me three proofs?&mdash;one
      to correct for Atlantic, one to send to Temple Bar (shall I tell them to
      use it not earlier than their November No.) and one to use in practising
      for my Boston readings.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must get up a less elaborate and a much better skeleton-plan for the
      Blindfold Novels and make a success of that idea. David Gray spent Sunday
      here and said we could but little comprehend what a rattling stir that
      thing would make in the country. He thought it would make a mighty strike.
      So do I. But with only 8 pages to tell the tale in, the plot must be less
      elaborate, doubtless. What do you think?
    </p>
    <p>
      When we exchange visits I&rsquo;ll show you an unfinished sketch of
      Elizabeth&rsquo;s time which shook David Gray&rsquo;s system up pretty

     The MS. sketch mentioned in the foregoing letter was &ldquo;The
     Canvasser&rsquo;s Tale,&rdquo; later included in the volume, Tom Sawyer Abroad,
     and Other Stories.  It is far from being Mark Twain&rsquo;s best work, but
     was accepted and printed in the Atlantic.  David Gray was an able
     journalist and editor whom Mark Twain had known in Buffalo.

     The &ldquo;sketch of Elizabeth&rsquo;s time&rdquo; is a brilliant piece of writing
     &mdash;an imaginary record of conversation and court manners in the good
     old days of free speech and performance, phrased in the language of
     the period.  Gray, John Hay, Twichell, and others who had a chance
     to see it thought highly of it, and Hay had it set in type and a few
     proofs taken for private circulation.  Some years afterward a West
     Point officer had a special font of antique type made for it, and
     printed a hundred copies.  But the present-day reader would hardly
     be willing to include &ldquo;Fireside Conversation in the Time of Queen

     Clemens was a strong Republican in those days, as his letters of
     this period show.  His mention of the &ldquo;caves&rdquo; in the next is another

      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Yes, the collection of caves was the origin of it.
      I changed it to echoes because these being invisible and intangible,
      constituted a still more absurd species of property, and yet a man could
      really own an echo, and sell it, too, for a high figure&mdash;such an echo
      as that at the Villa Siminetti, two miles from Milan, for instance. My
      first purpose was to have the man make a collection of caves and
      afterwards of echoes; but perceived that the element of absurdity and
      impracticability was so nearly identical as to amount to a repetition of
      an idea.....
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not, and do not, believe that there is a possibility of Hayes&rsquo;s
      defeat, but I want the victory to be sweeping.....
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems odd to find myself interested in an election. I never was before.
      And I can&rsquo;t seem to get over my repugnance to reading or thinking
      about politics, yet. But in truth I care little about any party&rsquo;s
      politics&mdash;the man behind it is the important thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may well know that Mrs. Clemens liked the Parlor Car&mdash;enjoyed it
      ever so much, and was indignant at you all through, and kept exploding
      into rages at you for pretending that such a woman ever existed&mdash;closing
      each and every explosion with &ldquo;But it is just what such a woman
      would do.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It is just what such a woman would say.&rdquo;
      They all voted the Parlor Car perfection&mdash;except me. I said they
      wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed to court and quarrel there so long,
      uninterrupted; but at each critical moment the odious train-boy would come
      in and pile foul literature all over them four or five inches deep, and
      the lover would turn his head aside and curse&mdash;and presently that
      train-boy would be back again (as on all those Western roads) to take up
      the literature and leave prize candy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the thing is perfect, in the magazine, without the train-boy;
      but I was thinking of the stage and the groundlings. If the dainty touches
      went over their heads, the train-boy and other possible interruptions
      would fetch them every time. Would it mar the flow of the thing too much
      to insert that devil? I thought it over a couple of hours and concluded it
      wouldn&rsquo;t, and that he ought to be in for the sake of the groundlings
      (and to get new copyright on the piece.)
    </p>
    <p>
      And it seemed to me that now that the fourth act is so successfully
      written, why not go ahead and write the 3 preceding acts? And then after
      it is finished, let me put into it a low-comedy character (the girl&rsquo;s
      or the lover&rsquo;s father or uncle) and gobble a big pecuniary interest
      in your work for myself. Do not let this generous proposition disturb your
      rest&mdash;but do write the other 3 acts, and then it will be valuable to
      managers. And don&rsquo;t go and sell it to anybody, like Harte, but keep
      it for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harte&rsquo;s play can be doctored till it will be entirely acceptable and
      then it will clear a great sum every year. I am out of all patience with
      Harte for selling it. The play entertained me hugely, even in its present
      crude state.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

     Following the Sellers success, Clemens had made many attempts at
     dramatic writing.  Such undertakings had uniformly failed, but he
     had always been willing to try again.  In the next letter we get the
     beginning of what proved his first and last direct literary
     association, that is to say, collaboration, with Bret Harte.
     Clemens had great admiration for Harte&rsquo;s ability and believed that
     between them they could turn out a successful play.  Whether or not
     this belief was justified will appear later.  Howells&rsquo;s biography of
     Hayes, meanwhile, had not gone well.  He reported that only two
     thousand copies had been sold in what was now the height of the
     campaign.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s success for you,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it makes me despair
     of the Republic.&rdquo;

     Clemens, on his part, had made a speech for Hayes that Howells
     declared had put civil-service reform in a nutshell; he added: &ldquo;You
     are the only Republican orator, quoted without distinction of party
     by all the newspapers.&rdquo;

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS, This is a secret, to be known to nobody but you (of
      course I comprehend that Mrs. Howells is part of you) that Bret Harte came
      up here the other day and asked me to help him write a play and divide the
      swag, and I agreed. I am to put in Scotty Briggs (See Buck Fanshaw&rsquo;s
      Funeral, in &ldquo;Roughing It.&rdquo;) and he is to put in a Chinaman (a
      wonderfully funny creature, as Bret presents him&mdash;for 5 minutes&mdash;in
      his Sandy Bar play.) This Chinaman is to be the character of the play, and
      both of us will work on him and develop him. Bret is to draw a plot, and I
      am to do the same; we shall use the best of the two, or gouge from both
      and build a third. My plot is built&mdash;finished it yesterday&mdash;six
      days&rsquo; work, 8 or 9 hours a day, and has nearly killed me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the favor I ask of you is that you will have the words &ldquo;Ah Sin,
      a Drama,&rdquo; printed in the middle of a note-paper page and send the
      same to me, with Bill. We don&rsquo;t want anybody to know that we are
      building this play. I can&rsquo;t get this title page printed here without
      having to lie so much that the thought of it is disagreeable to one reared
      as I have been. And yet the title of the play must be printed&mdash;the
      rest of the application for copyright is allowable in penmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have got the very best gang of servants in America, now. When George
      first came he was one of the most religious of men. He had but one fault&mdash;young
      George Washington&rsquo;s. But I have trained him; and now it fairly
      breaks Mrs. Clemens&rsquo;s heart to hear George stand at that front door
      and lie to the unwelcome visitor. But your time is valuable; I must not
      dwell upon these things.....I&rsquo;ll ask Warner and Harte if they&rsquo;ll
      do Blindfold Novelettes. Some time I&rsquo;ll simplify that plot. All it
      needs is that the hanging and the marriage shall not be appointed for the
      same day. I got over that difficulty, but it required too much MS to
      reconcile the thing&mdash;so the movement of the story was clogged.
    </p>

I came near agreeing to make political speeches with our candidate for
Governor the 16th and 23 inst., but I had to give up the idea, for Harte

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR BURROUGHS,&mdash;As you describe me I can picture myself as I was
      20 years ago. The portrait is correct. You think I have grown some; upon
      my word there was room for it. You have described a callow fool, a
      self-sufficient ass, a mere human tumble-bug.... imagining that he is
      remodeling the world and is entirely capable of doing it right. Ignorance,
      intolerance, egotism, self-assertion, opaque perception, dense and pitiful
      chuckle-headedness&mdash;and an almost pathetic unconsciousness of it all.
      That is what I was at 19 and 20; and that is what the average Southerner
      is at 60 today. Northerners, too, of a certain grade. It is of children
      like this that voters are made. And such is the primal source of our
      government! A man hardly knows whether to swear or cry over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think I comprehend the position there&mdash;perfect freedom to vote just
      as you choose, provided you choose to vote as other people think&mdash;social
      ostracism, otherwise. The same thing exists here, among the Irish. An
      Irish Republican is a pariah among his people. Yet that race find fault
      with the same spirit in Know-Nothingism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately a good deal of experience of men enabled me to choose my
      residence wisely. I live in the freest corner of the country. There are no
      social disabilities between me and my Democratic personal friends. We
      break the bread and eat the salt of hospitality freely together and never
      dream of such a thing as offering impertinent interference in each other&rsquo;s
      political opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don&rsquo;t you ever come to New York again and not run up here to see me.
      I Suppose we were away for the summer when you were East; but no matter,
      you could have telegraphed and found out. We were at Elmira N. Y. and
      right on your road, and could have given you a good time if you had
      allowed us the chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Will Bowen and I have exchanged letters now and then for several
      years, but I suspect that I made him mad with my last&mdash;shortly after
      you saw him in St. Louis, I judge. There is one thing which I can&rsquo;t
      stand and won&rsquo;t stand, from many people. That is sham sentimentality&mdash;the
      kind a school-girl puts into her graduating composition; the sort that
      makes up the Original Poetry column of a country newspaper; the rot that
      deals in the &ldquo;happy days of yore,&rdquo; the &ldquo;sweet yet
      melancholy past,&rdquo; with its &ldquo;blighted hopes&rdquo; and its
      &ldquo;vanished dreams&rdquo; and all that sort of drivel. Will&rsquo;s
      were always of this stamp. I stood it years. When I get a letter like that
      from a grown man and he a widower with a family, it gives me the stomach
      ache. And I just told Will Bowen so, last summer. I told him to stop being
      16 at 40; told him to stop drooling about the sweet yet melancholy past,
      and take a pill. I said there was but one solitary thing about the past
      worth remembering, and that was the fact that it is the past&mdash;can&rsquo;t
      be restored. Well, I exaggerated some of these truths a little&mdash;but
      only a little&mdash;but my idea was to kill his sham sentimentality once
      and forever, and so make a good fellow of him again. I went to the
      unheard-of trouble of re-writing the letter and saying the same harsh
      things softly, so as to sugarcoat the anguish and make it a little more
      endurable and I asked him to write and thank me honestly for doing him the
      best and kindliest favor that any friend ever had done him&mdash;but he
      hasn&rsquo;t done it yet. Maybe he will, sometime. I am grateful to God
      that I got that letter off before he was married (I get that news from
      you) else he would just have slobbered all over me and drowned me when
      that event happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enclose photograph for the young ladies. I will remark that I do not
      wear seal-skin for grandeur, but because I found, when I used to lecture
      in the winter, that nothing else was able to keep a man warm sometimes, in
      these high latitudes. I wish you had sent pictures of yourself and family&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      trade picture for picture with you, straight through, if you are
      commercially inclined.

      XVII. LETTERS, 1877. TO BERMUDA WITH TWICHELL. PROPOSITION TO TH. NAST.
      THE WHITTIER DINNER.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Mark Twain must have been too busy to write letters that winter.
     Those that have survived are few and unimportant.  As a matter of
     fact, he was writing the play, &ldquo;Ah Sin,&rdquo; with Bret Harte, and
     getting it ready for production. Harte was a guest in the Clemens
     home while the play was being written, and not always a pleasant
     one.  He was full of requirements, critical as to the &lsquo;menage,&rsquo; to
     the point of sarcasm.  The long friendship between Clemens and Harte
     weakened under the strain of collaboration and intimate daily
     intercourse, never to renew its old fiber.  It was an unhappy
     outcome of an enterprise which in itself was to prove of little
     profit.  The play, &ldquo;Ah Sin,&rdquo; had many good features, and with
     Charles T. Parsloe in an amusing Chinese part might have been made a
     success, if the two authors could have harmoniously undertaken the
     needed repairs.  It opened in Washington in May, and a letter from
     Parsloe, written at the moment, gives a hint of the situation.

    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                   WASHINGTON, D. C.  May 11th, 1877.
</pre>
    <p>
      MR. CLEMENS,&mdash;I forgot whether I acknowledged receipt of check by
      telegram. Harte has been here since Monday last and done little or nothing
      yet, but promises to have something fixed by tomorrow morning. We have
      been making some improvements among ourselves. The last act is weak at the
      end, and I do hope Mr. Harte will have something for a good finish to the
      piece. The other acts I think are all right, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hope you have entirely recovered. I am not very well myself, the
      excitement of a first night is bad enough, but to have the annoyance with
      Harte that I have is too much for a beginner. I ain&rsquo;t used to it.
      The houses have been picking up since Tuesday Mr. Ford has worked well and
      hard for us.

     The play drew some good houses in Washington, but it could not hold
     them for a run.  Never mind what was the matter with it; perhaps a
     very small change at the right point would have turned it into a
     fine success.  We have seen in a former letter the obligation which
     Mark Twain confessed to Harte&mdash;a debt he had tried in many ways to
     repay&mdash;obtaining for him a liberal book contract with Bliss;
     advancing him frequent and large sums of money which Harte could
     not, or did not, repay; seeking to advance his fortunes in many
     directions.  The mistake came when he introduced another genius into
     the intricacies of his daily life.  Clemens went down to Washington
     during the early rehearsals of &ldquo;Ah Sin.&rdquo;

     Meantime, Rutherford B. Hayes had been elected President, and
     Clemens one day called with a letter of introduction from Howells,
     thinking to meet the Chief Executive.  His own letter to Howells,
     later, probably does not give the real reason of his failure, but it
     will be amusing to those who recall the erratic personality of
     George Francis Train.  Train and Twain were sometimes confused by
     the very unlettered; or pretendedly, by Mark Twain&rsquo;s friends.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Found I was not absolutely needed in Washington so
      I only staid 24 hours, and am on my way home, now. I called at the White
      House, and got admission to Col. Rodgers, because I wanted to inquire what
      was the right hour to go and infest the President. It was my luck to
      strike the place in the dead waste and middle of the day, the very busiest
      time. I perceived that Mr. Rodgers took me for George Francis Train and
      had made up his mind not to let me get at the President; so at the end of
      half an hour I took my letter of introduction from the table and went
      away. It was a great pity all round, and a great loss to the nation, for I
      was brim full of the Eastern question. I didn&rsquo;t get to see the
      President or the Chief Magistrate either, though I had sort of a glimpse
      of a lady at a window who resembled her portraits.

     Howells condoled with him on his failure to see the President,
     &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if you and I had both been there, our combined
     skill would have no doubt procured us to be expelled from the White
     House by Fred Douglass.  But the thing seems to be a complete
     failure as it was.&rdquo;  Douglass at this time being the Marshal of
     Columbia, gives special point to Howells&rsquo;s suggestion.

     Later, in May, Clemens took Twichell for an excursion to Bermuda.
     He had begged Howells to go with them, but Howells, as usual, was
     full of literary affairs.  Twichell and Clemens spent four glorious
     days tramping the length and breadth of the beautiful island, and
     remembered it always as one of their happiest adventures.  &ldquo;Put it
     down as an Oasis!&rdquo; wrote Twichell on his return, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I shall
     not see as green a spot again soon.  And it was your invention and
     your gift.  And your company was the best of it.  Indeed, I never
     took more comfort in being with you than on this journey, which, my
     boy, is saying a great deal.&rdquo;

      Confound you, Joe Twichell and I roamed about Bermuda day and night and
      never ceased to gabble and enjoy. About half the talk was&mdash;&ldquo;It

      could get at the very meat and marrow of this pervading charm and
      deliciousness like Howells;&rdquo; &ldquo;How Howells would revel in the
      quaintness, and the simplicity of this people and the Sabbath repose of
      this land.&rdquo; &ldquo;What an imperishable sketch Howells would make of
      Capt. West the whaler, and Capt. Hope with the patient, pathetic face,
      wanderer in all the oceans for 42 years, lucky in none; coming home
      defeated once more, now, minus his ship&mdash;resigned, uncomplaining,
      being used to this.&rdquo; &ldquo;What a rattling chapter Howells would
      make out of the small boy Alfred, with his alert eye and military brevity
      and exactness of speech; and out of the old landlady; and her sacred
      onions; and her daughter; and the visiting clergyman; and the ancient

      Day after tomorrow we leave for the hills beyond Elmira, N. Y. for the
      summer, when I shall hope to write a book of some sort or other to beat
      the people with. A work similar to your new one in the Atlantic is what I
      mean, though I have not heard what the nature of that one is. Immoral, I
      suppose. Well, you are right. Such books sell best, Howells says. Howells
      says he is going to make his next book indelicate. He says he thinks there
      is money in it. He says there is a large class of the young, in schools
      and seminaries who&mdash;But you let him tell you. He has ciphered it all

     Clemens would naturally write something about Bermuda, and began at
     once, &ldquo;Random Notes of an Idle Excursion,&rdquo; and presently completed
     four papers, which Howells eagerly accepted for the Atlantic.  Then
     we find him plunging into another play, this time alone.

      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;If you should not like the first 2 chapters, send
      them to me and begin with Chapter 3&mdash;or Part 3, I believe you call
      these things in the magazine. I have finished No. 4., which closes the
      series, and will mail it tomorrow if I think of it. I like this one, I
      liked the preceding one (already mailed to you some time ago) but I had my
      doubts about 1 and 2. Do not hesitate to squelch them, even with derision
      and insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today I am deep in a comedy which I began this morning&mdash;principal
      character, that old detective&mdash;I skeletoned the first act and wrote
      the second, today; and am dog-tired, now. Fifty-four close pages of MS in
      7 hours. Once I wrote 55 pages at a sitting&mdash;that was on the opening
      chapters of the &ldquo;Gilded Age&rdquo; novel. When I cool down, an hour
      from now, I shall go to zero, I judge.

     Clemens had doubts as to the quality of the Bermuda papers, and with

     they were pleasantly entertaining, and Howells expressed full
     approval of them for Atlantic use.  The author remained troubled.

    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;It is splendid of you to say those pleasant things.
      But I am still plagued with doubts about Parts 1 and 2. If you have any,
      don&rsquo;t print. If otherwise, please make some cold villain like
      Lathrop read and pass sentence on them. Mind, I thought they were good, at
      first&mdash;it was the second reading that accomplished its hellish
      purpose on me. Put them up for a new verdict. Part 4 has lain in my
      pigeon-hole a good while, and when I put it there I had a Christian&rsquo;s
      confidence in 4 aces in it; and you can be sure it will skip toward
      Connecticut tomorrow before any fatal fresh reading makes me draw my bet.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ve piled up 151 MS pages on my comedy. The first, second and
      fourth acts are done, and done to my satisfaction, too. Tomorrow and next
      day will finish the 3rd act and the play. I have not written less than 30
      pages any day since I began. Never had so much fun over anything in my
      life-never such consuming interest and delight. (But Lord bless you the
      second reading will fetch it!) And just think!&mdash;I had Sol Smith
      Russell in my mind&rsquo;s eye for the old detective&rsquo;s part, and
      hang it he has gone off pottering with Oliver Optic, or else the papers
      lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      I read everything about the President&rsquo;s doings there with
      exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish that old ass of a private secretary hadn&rsquo;t taken me for
      George Francis Train. If ignorance were a means of grace I wouldn&rsquo;t
      trade that gorilla&rsquo;s chances for the Archbishop of Canterbury&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall call on the President again, by and by. I shall go in my war
      paint; and if I am obstructed the nation will have the unusual spectacle
      of a private secretary with a pen over one ear a tomahawk over the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      I read the entire Atlantic this time. Wonderful number. Mrs. Rose Terry
      Cooke&rsquo;s story was a ten-strike. I wish she would write 12 old-time
      New England tales a year.
    </p>

     The play, &ldquo;Ah Sin,&rdquo; that had done little enough in Washington, was
     that summer given another trial by Augustin Daly, at the Fifth
     Avenue Theater, New York, with a fine company.  Clemens had
     undertaken to doctor the play, and it would seem to have had an
     enthusiastic reception on the opening night.  But it was a summer
     audience, unspoiled by many attractions.  &ldquo;Ah Sin&rdquo; was never a
     success in the New York season&mdash;never a money-maker on the road.

     The reference in the first paragraph of the letter that follows is
     to the Bermuda chapters which Mark Twain was publishing
     simultaneously in England and America.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I have mailed one set of the slips to London, and
      told Bentley you would print Sept. 15, in October Atlantic, and he must
      not print earlier in Temple Bar. Have I got the dates and things right?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am powerful glad to see that No. 1 reads a nation sight better in print
      than it did in MS. I told Bentley we&rsquo;d send him the slips, each
      time, 6 weeks before day of publication. We can do that can&rsquo;t we?
      Two months ahead would be still better I suppose, but I don&rsquo;t know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah Sin&rdquo; went a-booming at the Fifth Avenue. The reception of
      Col. Sellers was calm compared to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The criticisms were just; the criticisms of the great New York dailies are
      always just, intelligent, and square and honest&mdash;notwithstanding, by
      a blunder which nobody was seriously to blame for, I was made to say
      exactly the opposite of this in a newspaper some time ago. Never said it
      at all, and moreover I never thought it. I could not publicly correct it
      before the play appeared in New York, because that would look as if I had
      really said that thing and then was moved by fears for my pocket and my
      reputation to take it back. But I can correct it now, and shall do it; for
      now my motives cannot be impugned. When I began this letter, it had not
      occurred to me to use you in this connection, but it occurs to me now.
      Your opinion and mine, uttered a year ago, and repeated more than once
      since, that the candor and ability of the New York critics were beyond
      question, is a matter which makes it proper enough that I should speak
      through you at this time. Therefore if you will print this paragraph
      somewhere, it may remove the impression that I say unjust things which I
      do not think, merely for the pleasure of talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, now, Can&rsquo;t you say&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;In a letter to Mr. Howells of the Atlantic Monthly, Mark
     Twain describes the reception of the new comedy &lsquo;Ali Sin,&rsquo;
     and then goes on to say:&rdquo; etc.
</pre>
    <p>
      Beginning at the star with the words, &ldquo;The criticisms were just.&rdquo;
      Mrs. Clemens says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask that of Mr. Howells&mdash;it
      will be disagreeable to him.&rdquo; I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it, but I
      will bet two to one on the correctness of her instinct. We shall see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you cut that paragraph out of this letter and precede it with the
      remarks suggested (or with better ones,) and send it to the Globe or some
      other paper? You can&rsquo;t do me a bigger favor; and yet if it is in the
      least disagreeable, you mustn&rsquo;t think of it. But let me know, right
      away, for I want to correct this thing before it grows stale again. I
      explained myself to only one critic (the World)&mdash;the consequence was
      a noble notice of the play. This one called on me, else I shouldn&rsquo;t
      have explained myself to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been putting in a deal of hard work on that play in New York, but
      it is full of incurable defects.
    </p>
    <p>
      My old Plunkett family seemed wonderfully coarse and vulgar on the stage,
      but it was because they were played in such an outrageously and
      inexcusably coarse way. The Chinaman is killingly funny. I don&rsquo;t
      know when I have enjoyed anything as much as I did him. The people say
      there isn&rsquo;t enough of him in the piece. That&rsquo;s a triumph&mdash;there&rsquo;ll
      never be any more of him in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Brougham said, &ldquo;Read the list of things which the critics have
      condemned in the piece, and you have unassailable proofs that the play
      contains all the requirements of success and a long life.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That is true. Nearly every time the audience roared I knew it was over
      something that would be condemned in the morning (justly, too) but must be
      left in&mdash;for low comedies are written for the drawing-room, the
      kitchen and the stable, and if you cut out the kitchen and the stable the
      drawing-room can&rsquo;t support the play by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was as much money in the house the first two nights as in the first
      ten of Sellers. Haven&rsquo;t heard from the third&mdash;I came away.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     In a former letter we have seen how Mark Twain, working on a story
     that was to stand as an example of his best work, and become one of
     his surest claims to immortality (The Adventures of Huckleberry
     Finn), displayed little enthusiasm in his undertaking.  In the
     following letter, which relates the conclusion of his detective
     comedy, we find him at the other extreme, on very tiptoe with
     enthusiasm over something wholly without literary value or dramatic
     possibility.  One of the hall-marks of genius is the inability to
     discriminate as to the value of its output.  &ldquo;Simon Wheeler, Amateur
     Detective&rdquo; was a dreary, absurd, impossible performance, as wild and
     unconvincing in incident and dialogue as anything out of an asylum
     could well be.  The title which he first chose for it, &ldquo;Balaam&rsquo;s
     Ass,&rdquo; was properly in keeping with the general scheme.  Yet Mark
     Twain, still warm with the creative fever, had the fullest faith in
     it as a work of art and a winner of fortune.  It would never see the
     light of production, of course.  We shall see presently that the
     distinguished playwright, Dion Boucicault, good-naturedly
     complimented it as being better than &ldquo;Ahi Sin.&rdquo;  One must wonder
     what that skilled artist really thought, and how he could do even
     this violence to his conscience.

    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;It&rsquo;s finished. I was misled by hurried
      mis-paging. There were ten pages of notes, and over 300 pages of MS when
      the play was done. Did it in 42 hours, by the clock; 40 pages of the
      Atlantic&mdash;but then of course it&rsquo;s very &ldquo;fat.&rdquo; Those
      are the figures, but I don&rsquo;t believe them myself, because the thing&rsquo;s
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let that pass. All day long, and every day, since I finished (in the
      rough) I have been diligently altering, amending, re-writing, cutting
      down. I finished finally today. Can&rsquo;t think of anything else in the
      way of an improvement. I thought I would stick to it while the interest
      was hot&mdash;and I am mighty glad I did. A week from now it will be
      frozen&mdash;then revising would be drudgery. (You see I learned something
      from the fatal blunder of putting &ldquo;Ah Sin&rdquo; aside before it was
      finished.)
    </p>
    <p>
      She&rsquo;s all right, now. She reads in two hours and 20 minutes and will
      play not longer than 2 3/4 hours. Nineteen characters; 3 acts; (I bunched
      2 into 1.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Tomorrow I will draw up an exhaustive synopsis to insert in the printed
      title-page for copyrighting, and then on Friday or Saturday I go to New
      York to remain a week or ten days and lay for an actor. Wish you could run

      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Just got your letter last night. No, dern that
      article,&mdash;[One of the Bermuda chapters.]&mdash;it made me cry when I
      read it in proof, it was so oppressively and ostentatiously poor. Skim
      your eye over it again and you will think as I do. If Isaac and the
      prophets of Baal can be doctored gently and made permissible, it will
      redeem the thing: but if it can&rsquo;t, let&rsquo;s burn all of the
      articles except the tail-end of it and use that as an introduction to the
      next article&mdash;as I suggested in my letter to you of day before
      yesterday. (I had this proof from Cambridge before yours came.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Boucicault says my new play is ever so much better than &ldquo;Ah Sin;&rdquo;
      says the Amateur detective is a bully character, too. An actor is chawing
      over the play in New York, to see if the old Detective is suited to his
      abilities. Haven&rsquo;t heard from him yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you&rsquo;ve got that paragraph by you yet, and if in your judgment it
      would be good to publish it, and if you absolutely would not mind doing
      it, then I think I&rsquo;d like to have you do it&mdash;or else put some
      other words in my mouth that will be properer, and publish them. But mind,
      don&rsquo;t think of it for a moment if it is distasteful&mdash;and
      doubtless it is. I value your judgment more than my own, as to the wisdom
      of saying anything at all in this matter. To say nothing leaves me in an
      injurious position&mdash;and yet maybe I might do better to speak to the
      men themselves when I go to New York. This was my latest idea, and it
      looked wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      We expect to leave here for home Sept. 4, reaching there the 8th&mdash;but
      we may be delayed a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious thing. I read passages from my play, and a full synopsis, to
      Boucicault, who was re-writing a play, which he wrote and laid aside 3 or
      4 years ago. (My detective is about that age, you know.) Then he read a
      passage from his play, where a real detective does some things that are as
      idiotic as some of my old Wheeler&rsquo;s performances. Showed me the
      passages, and behold, his man&rsquo;s name is Wheeler! However, his
      Wheeler is not a prominent character, so we&rsquo;ll not alter the names.
      My Wheeler&rsquo;s name is taken from the old jumping Frog sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am re-reading Ticknor&rsquo;s diary, and am charmed with it, though I
      still say he refers to too many good things when he could just as well
      have told them. Think of the man traveling 8 days in convoy and familiar
      intercourse with a band of outlaws through the mountain fastnesses of
      Spain&mdash;he the fourth stranger they had encountered in thirty years&mdash;and
      compressing this priceless experience into a single colorless paragraph of
      his diary! They spun yarns to this unworthy devil, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote you a very long letter a day or two ago, but Susy Crane wanted to
      make a copy of it to keep, so it has not gone yet. It may go today,
      possibly.

     The Ticknor referred to in a former letter was Professor George
     Ticknor, of Harvard College, a history-writer of distinction.  On
     the margin of the &ldquo;Diary&rdquo; Mark Twain once wrote, &ldquo;Ticknor is a
     Millet, who makes all men fall in love with him.&rdquo;  And adds: &ldquo;Millet
     was the cause of lovable qualities in people, and then he admired
     and loved those persons for the very qualities which he (without
     knowing it) had created in them.  Perhaps it would be strictly truer
     of these two men to say that they bore within them the divine
     something in whose presence the evil in people fled away and hid
     itself, while all that was good in them came spontaneously forward
     out of the forgotten walls and comers in their systems where it was
     accustomed to hide.&rdquo;

     It is Frank Millet, the artist, he is speaking of&mdash;a knightly soul
     whom all the Clemens household loved, and who would one day meet his
     knightly end with those other brave men that found death together
     when the Titanic went down.

     The Clemens family was still at Quarry Farm at the end of August,
     and one afternoon there occurred a startling incident which Mark
     Twain thought worth setting down in practically duplicate letters to
     Howells and to Dr. John Brown.  It may be of interest to the reader
     to know that John T. Lewis, the colored man mentioned, lived to a
     good old age&mdash;a pensioner of the Clemens family and, in the course
     of time, of H. H. Rogers.  Howells&rsquo;s letter follows.  It is the
     &ldquo;very long letter&rdquo; referred to in the foregoing.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLSES,&mdash;I thought I ought to make a sort of record of it
      for further reference; the pleasantest way to do that would be to write it
      to somebody; but that somebody would let it leak into print and that we
      wish to avoid. The Howellses would be safe&mdash;so let us tell the
      Howellses about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day before yesterday was a fine summer day away up here on the summit.
      Aunt Marsh and Cousin May Marsh were here visiting Susie Crane and Livy at
      our farmhouse. By and by mother Langdon came up the hill in the &ldquo;high
      carriage&rdquo; with Nora the nurse and little Jervis (Charley Langdon&rsquo;s
      little boy)&mdash;Timothy the coachman driving. Behind these came Charley&rsquo;s
      wife and little girl in the buggy, with the new, young, spry, gray horse&mdash;a
      high-stepper. Theodore Crane arrived a little later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bay and Susy were on hand with their nurse, Rosa. I was on hand, too.
      Susy Crane&rsquo;s trio of colored servants ditto&mdash;these being Josie,
      house-maid; Aunty Cord, cook, aged 62, turbaned, very tall, very broad,
      very fine every way (see her portrait in &ldquo;A True Story just as I
      Heard It&rdquo; in my Sketches;) Chocklate (the laundress) (as the Bay
      calls her&mdash;she can&rsquo;t say Charlotte,) still taller, still more
      majestic of proportions, turbaned, very black, straight as an Indian&mdash;age
      24. Then there was the farmer&rsquo;s wife (colored) and her little girl,
      Susy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wasn&rsquo;t it a good audience to get up an excitement before? Good
      excitable, inflammable material?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis was still down town, three miles away, with his two-horse wagon, to
      get a load of manure. Lewis is the farmer (colored). He is of mighty frame
      and muscle, stocky, stooping, ungainly, has a good manly face and a clear
      eye. Age about 45&mdash;and the most picturesque of men, when he sits in
      his fluttering work-day rags, humped forward into a bunch, with his aged
      slouch hat mashed down over his ears and neck. It is a spectacle to make
      the broken-hearted smile. Lewis has worked mighty hard and remained mighty
      poor. At the end of each whole year&rsquo;s toil he can&rsquo;t show a
      gain of fifty dollars. He had borrowed money of the Cranes till he owed
      them $700 and he being conscientious and honest, imagine what it was to
      him to have to carry this stubborn, helpless load year in and year out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, sunset came, and Ida the young and comely (Charley Langdon&rsquo;s
      wife) and her little Julia and the nurse Nora, drove out at the gate
      behind the new gray horse and started down the long hill&mdash;the high
      carriage receiving its load under the porte cochere. Ida was seen to turn
      her face toward us across the fence and intervening lawn&mdash;Theodore
      waved good-bye to her, for he did not know that her sign was a speechless
      appeal for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment Livy said, &ldquo;Ida&rsquo;s driving too fast down hill!&rdquo;
      She followed it with a sort of scream, &ldquo;Her horse is running away!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We could see two hundred yards down that descent. The buggy seemed to fly.
      It would strike obstructions and apparently spring the height of a man
      from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Theodore and I left the shrieking crowd behind and ran down the hill
      bare-headed and shouting. A neighbor appeared at his gate&mdash;a tenth of
      a second too late! the buggy vanished past him like a thought. My last
      glimpse showed it for one instant, far down the descent, springing high in
      the air out of a cloud of dust, and then it disappeared. As I flew down
      the road my impulse was to shut my eyes as I turned them to the right or
      left, and so delay for a moment the ghastly spectacle of mutilation and
      death I was expecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ran on and on, still spared this spectacle, but saying to myself:
      &ldquo;I shall see it at the turn of the road; they never can pass that
      turn alive.&rdquo; When I came in sight of that turn I saw two wagons
      there bunched together&mdash;one of them full of people. I said, &ldquo;Just
      so&mdash;they are staring petrified at the remains.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But when I got amongst that bunch, there sat Ida in her buggy and nobody
      hurt, not even the horse or the vehicle. Ida was pale but serene. As I
      came tearing down, she smiled back over her shoulder at me and said,
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re alive yet, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; A miracle had
      been performed&mdash;nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      You see Lewis, the prodigious, humped upon his front seat, had been
      toiling up, on his load of manure; he saw the frantic horse plunging down
      the hill toward him, on a full gallop, throwing his heels as high as a man&rsquo;s
      head at every jump. So Lewis turned his team diagonally across the road
      just at the &ldquo;turn,&rdquo; thus making a V with the fence&mdash;the
      running horse could not escape that, but must enter it. Then Lewis sprang
      to the ground and stood in this V. He gathered his vast strength, and with
      a perfect Creedmoor aim he seized the gray horse&rsquo;s bit as he plunged
      by and fetched him up standing!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was down hill, mind you. Ten feet further down hill neither Lewis nor
      any other man could have saved them, for they would have been on the
      abrupt &ldquo;turn,&rdquo; then. But how this miracle was ever
      accomplished at all, by human strength, generalship and accuracy, is clean
      beyond my comprehension&mdash;and grows more so the more I go and examine
      the ground and try to believe it was actually done. I know one thing,
      well; if Lewis had missed his aim he would have been killed on the spot in
      the trap he had made for himself, and we should have found the rest of the
      remains away down at the bottom of the steep ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later Theodore and I arrived opposite the house, with the
      servants straggling after us, and shouted to the distracted group on the
      porch, &ldquo;Everybody safe!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Believe it? Why how could they? They knew the road perfectly. We might as
      well have said it to people who had seen their friends go over Niagara.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we convinced them; and then, instead of saying something, or
      going on crying, they grew very still&mdash;words could not express it, I
      suppose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody could do anything that night, or sleep, either; but there was a
      deal of moving talk, with long pauses between pictures of that flying
      carriage, these pauses represented&mdash;this picture intruded itself all
      the time and disjointed the talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      But yesterday evening late, when Lewis arrived from down town he found his
      supper spread, and some presents of books there, with very complimentary
      writings on the fly-leaves, and certain very complimentary letters, and
      more or less greenbacks of dignified denomination pinned to these letters
      and fly-leaves,&mdash;and one said, among other things, (signed by the
      Cranes) &ldquo;We cancel $400 of your indebtedness to us,&rdquo; &amp;c.
      &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      (The end thereof is not yet, of course, for Charley Langdon is West and
      will arrive ignorant of all these things, today.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper-room had been kept locked and imposingly secret and mysterious
      until Lewis should arrive; but around that part of the house were gathered
      Lewis&rsquo;s wife and child, Chocklate, Josie, Aunty Cord and our Rosa,
      canvassing things and waiting impatiently. They were all on hand when the
      curtain rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Aunty Cord is a violent Methodist and Lewis an implacable Dunker&mdash;Baptist.
      Those two are inveterate religious disputants. The revealments having been
      made Aunty Cord said with effusion&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, let folks go on saying there ain&rsquo;t no God! Lewis, the
      Lord sent you there to stop that horse.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Says Lewis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then who sent the horse there in sich a shape?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I want to call your attention to one thing. When Lewis arrived the
      other evening, after saving those lives by a feat which I think is the
      most marvelous of any I can call to mind&mdash;when he arrived, hunched up
      on his manure wagon and as grotesquely picturesque as usual, everybody
      wanted to go and see how he looked. They came back and said he was
      beautiful. It was so, too&mdash;and yet he would have photographed exactly
      as he would have done any day these past 7 years that he has occupied this
      farm.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                                       Aug. 27.
</pre>
    <p>
      P. S. Our little romance in real life is happily and satisfactorily
      completed. Charley has come, listened, acted&mdash;and now John T. Lewis
      has ceased to consider himself as belonging to that class called &ldquo;the
      poor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been known, during some years, that it was Lewis&rsquo;s purpose to
      buy a thirty dollar silver watch some day, if he ever got where he could
      afford it. Today Ida has given him a new, sumptuous gold Swiss
      stem-winding stop-watch; and if any scoffer shall say, &ldquo;Behold this
      thing is out of character,&rdquo; there is an inscription within, which
      will silence him; for it will teach him that this wearer aggrandizes the
      watch, not the watch the wearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was asked beforehand, if this would be a wise gift, and I said &ldquo;Yes,
      the very wisest of all;&rdquo; I know the colored race, and I know that in
      Lewis&rsquo;s eyes this fine toy will throw the other more valuable
      testimonials far away into the shade. If he lived in England the Humane
      Society would give him a gold medal as costly as this watch, and nobody
      would say: &ldquo;It is out of character.&rdquo; If Lewis chose to wear a
      town clock, who would become it better?
    </p>
    <p>
      Lewis has sound common sense, and is not going to be spoiled. The instant
      he found himself possessed of money, he forgot himself in a plan to make
      his old father comfortable, who is wretchedly poor and lives down in
      Maryland. His next act, on the spot, was the proffer to the Cranes of the
      $300 of his remaining indebtedness to them. This was put off by them to
      the indefinite future, for he is not going to be allowed to pay that at
      all, though he doesn&rsquo;t know it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter of acknowledgment from Lewis contains a sentence which raises it
      to the dignity of literature:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I beg to say, humbly, that inasmuch as divine providence saw
      fit to use me as a instrument for the saving of those presshious lives,
      the honner conferd upon me was greater than the feat performed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That is well said.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Howells was moved to use the story in the &ldquo;Contributors&rsquo; Club,&rdquo;
      and warned Clemens against letting it get into the newspapers.  He
     declared he thought it one of the most impressive things he had ever
     read.  But Clemens seems never to have allowed it to be used in any
     form.  In its entirety, therefore, it is quite new matter.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        HARTFORD, Sept.  19, 1877.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t really see how the story of the
      runaway horse could read well with the little details of names and places
      and things left out. They are the true life of all narrative. It wouldn&rsquo;t
      quite do to print them at this time. We&rsquo;ll talk about it when you
      come. Delicacy&mdash;a sad, sad false delicacy&mdash;robs literature of
      the best two things among its belongings. Family-circle narrative and
      obscene stories. But no matter; in that better world which I trust we are
      all going to I have the hope and belief that they will not be denied us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say&mdash;Twichell and I had an adventure at sea, 4 months ago, which I
      did not put in my Bermuda articles, because there was not enough to it.
      But the press dispatches bring the sequel today, and now there&rsquo;s
      plenty to it. A sailless, wasteless, chartless, compassless, grubless old
      condemned tub that has been drifting helpless about the ocean for 4 months
      and a half, begging bread and water like any other tramp, flying a signal
      of distress permanently, and with 13 innocent, marveling chuckleheaded
      Bermuda niggers on board, taking a Pleasure Excursion! Our ship fed the
      poor devils on the 25th of last May, far out at sea and left them to
      bullyrag their way to New York&mdash;and now they ain&rsquo;t as near New
      York as they were then by 250 miles! They have drifted 750 miles and are
      still drifting in the relentless Gulf Stream! What a delicious magazine
      chapter it would make&mdash;but I had to deny myself. I had to come right
      out in the papers at once, with my details, so as to try to raise the
      government&rsquo;s sympathy sufficiently to have better succor sent them
      than the cutter Colfax, which went a little way in search of them the
      other day and then struck a fog and gave it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the President were in Washington I would telegraph him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I hear that the &ldquo;Jonas Smith&rdquo; has been found again, I
      mean to send for one of those darkies, to come to Hartford and give me his
      adventures for an Atlantic article.
    </p>
    <p>
      Likely you will see my today&rsquo;s article in the newspapers.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                   Yrs ever,

</pre>
    <p>
      The revenue cutter Colfax went after the Jonas Smith, thinking there was
      mutiny or other crime on board. It occurs to me now that, since there is
      only mere suffering and misery and nobody to punish, it ceases to be a
      matter which (a republican form of) government will feel authorized to
      interfere in further. Dam a republican form of government.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Clemens thought he had given up lecturing for good; he was
     prosperous and he had no love for the platform.  But one day an idea
     popped into his head: Thomas Nast, the &ldquo;father of the American
     cartoon,&rdquo; had delivered a successful series of illustrated lectures
     &mdash;talks for which he made the drawings as he went along.  Mark
     Twain&rsquo;s idea was to make a combination with Nast.  His letter gives
     us the plan in full.

      To Thomas Nast, Morristown, N. J.:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                             HARTFORD, CONN. 1877.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR NAST,&mdash;I did not think I should ever stand on a platform
      again until the time was come for me to say &ldquo;I die innocent.&rdquo;
      But the same old offers keep arriving. I have declined them all, just as
      usual, though sorely tempted, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I do not decline because I mind talking to an audience, but because
      (1) traveling alone is so heartbreakingly dreary, and (2) shouldering the
      whole show is such a cheer-killing responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, I now propose to you what you proposed to me in 1867, ten years
      ago (when I was unknown) viz., that you stand on the platform and make
      pictures, and I stand by you and blackguard the audience. I should
      enormously enjoy meandering around (to big towns&mdash;don&rsquo;t want to
      go to the little ones) with you for company.
    </p>
    <p>
      My idea is not to fatten the lecture agents and lyceums on the spoils, but
      put all the ducats religiously into two equal piles, and say to the artist
      and lecturer, &ldquo;Absorb these.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance&mdash;[Here follows a plan and a possible list of cities to
      be visited. The letter continues]
    </p>
    <p>
      Call the gross receipts $100,000 for four months and a half, and the
      profit from $60,000 to $75,000 (I try to make the figures large enough,
      and leave it to the public to reduce them.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not put in Philadelphia because Pugh owns that town, and last winter
      when I made a little reading-trip he only paid me $300 and pretended his
      concert (I read fifteen minutes in the midst of a concert) cost him a vast
      sum, and so he couldn&rsquo;t afford any more. I could get up a better
      concert with a barrel of cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have imagined two or three pictures and concocted the accompanying
      remarks to see how the thing would go. I was charmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you think it over, Nast, and drop me a line. We should have some
      fun.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                    Yours truly,
                         SAMUEL L. CLEMENS.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The plan came to nothing.  Nast, like Clemens, had no special taste
     for platforming, and while undoubtedly there would have been large
     profits in the combination, the promise of the venture did not
     compel his acceptance.

     In spite of his distaste for the platform Mark Twain was always
     giving readings and lectures, without charge, for some worthy
     Hartford cause.  He was ready to do what he could to help an
     entertainment along, if he could do it in his own way&mdash;an original
     way, sometimes, and not always gratifying to the committee, whose
     plans were likely to be prearranged.

     For one thing, Clemens, supersensitive in the matter of putting
     himself forward in his own town, often objected to any special
     exploitation of his name.  This always distressed the committee, who
     saw a large profit to their venture in the prestige of his fame.
     The following characteristic letter was written in self-defense
     when, on one such occasion, a committee had become sufficiently
     peevish to abandon a worthy enterprise.

      To an Entertainment Committee, in Hartford:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        Nov. 9.
E. S. SYKES, Esq:
</pre>
    <p>
      Dr. SIR,&mdash;Mr. Burton&rsquo;s note puts upon me all the blame of the
      destruction of an enterprise which had for its object the succor of the
      Hartford poor. That is to say, this enterprise has been dropped because of
      the &ldquo;dissatisfaction with Mr. Clemens&rsquo;s stipulations.&rdquo;
      Therefore I must be allowed to say a word in my defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two &ldquo;stipulations&rdquo;&mdash;exactly two. I made one of
      them; if the other was made at all, it was a joint one, from the choir and
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      My individual stipulation was, that my name should be kept out of the
      newspapers. The joint one was that sufficient tickets to insure a good sum
      should be sold before the date of the performance should be set.
      (Understand, we wanted a good sum&mdash;I do not think any of us bothered
      about a good house; it was money we were after)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you perceive that my concern is simply with my individual stipulation.
      Did that break up the enterprise?
    </p>
    <p>
      Eugene Burton said he would sell $300 worth of the tickets himself.&mdash;Mr.
      Smith said he would sell $200 or $300 worth himself. My plan for Asylum
      Hill Church would have ensured $150 from that quarter.&mdash;All this in
      the face of my &ldquo;Stipulation.&rdquo; It was proposed to raise $1000;
      did my stipulation render the raising of $400 or $500 in a dozen churches
      impossible?
    </p>
    <p>
      My stipulation is easily defensible. When a mere reader or lecturer has
      appeared 3 or 4 times in a town of Hartford&rsquo;s size, he is a good
      deal more than likely to get a very unpleasant snub if he shoves himself
      forward about once or twice more. Therefore I long ago made up my mind
      that whenever I again appeared here, it should be only in a minor capacity
      and not as a chief attraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I placed that harmless and very justifiable stipulation before the
      committee the other day; they carried it to headquarters and it was
      accepted there. I am not informed that any objection was made to it, or
      that it was regarded as an offense. It seems late in the day, now, after a
      good deal of trouble has been taken and a good deal of thankless work done
      by the committees, to, suddenly tear up the contract and then turn and
      bowl me down from long range as being the destroyer of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the enterprise has failed because of my individual stipulation, here
      you have my proper and reasonable reasons for making that stipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it has failed because of the joint stipulation, put the blame there,
      and let us share it collectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think our plan was a good one. I do not doubt that Mr. Burton still
      approves of it, too. I believe the objections come from other quarters,
      and not from him. Mr. Twichell used the following words in last Sunday&rsquo;s
      sermon, (if I remember correctly):
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My hearers, the prophet Deuteronomy says this wise thing: &lsquo;Though
      ye plan a goodly house for the poor, and plan it with wisdom, and do take
      off your coats and set to to build it, with high courage, yet shall the
      croaker presently come, and lift up his voice, (having his coat on,) and
      say, Verily this plan is not well planned&mdash;and he will go his way;
      and the obstructionist will come, and lift up his voice, (having his coat
      on,) and say, Behold, this is but a sick plan&mdash;and he will go his
      way; and the man that knows it all will come, and lift up his voice,
      (having his coat on,) and say, Lo, call they this a plan? then will he go
      his way; and the places which knew him once shall know him no more
      forever, because he was not, for God took him. Now therefore I say unto
      you, Verily that house will not be budded. And I say this also: He that
      waiteth for all men to be satisfied with his plan, let him seek eternal
      life, for he shall need it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This portion of Mr. Twichell&rsquo;s sermon made a great impression upon
      me, and I was grieved that some one had not wakened me earlier so that I
      might have heard what went before.

     Mr. Sykes (of the firm of Sykes &amp; Newton, the Allen House Pharmacy)
     replied that he had read the letter to the committee and that it had
     set those gentlemen right who had not before understood the
     situation.  &ldquo;If others were as ready to do their part as yourself
     our poor would not want assistance,&rdquo; he said, in closing.

     We come now to an incident which assumes the proportions of an
     episode-even of a catastrophe&mdash;in Mark Twain&rsquo;s career.  The disaster
     was due to a condition noted a few pages earlier&mdash;the inability of
     genius to judge its own efforts.  The story has now become history
     &mdash;printed history&mdash;it having been sympathetically told by Howells in
     My Mark Twain, and more exhaustively, with a report of the speech
     that invited the lightning, in a former work by the present writer.

     The speech was made at John Greenleaf Whittier&rsquo;s seventieth birthday
     dinner, given by the Atlantic staff on the evening of December 17,
     1877.  It was intended as a huge joke&mdash;a joke that would shake the
     sides of these venerable Boston deities, Longfellow, Emerson,
     Holmes, and the rest of that venerated group.  Clemens had been a
     favorite at the Atlantic lunches and dinners&mdash;a speech by him always
     an event.  This time he decided to outdo himself.

     He did that, but not in the way he had intended.  To use one of his
     own metaphors, he stepped out to meet the rainbow and got struck by
     lightning.  His joke was not of the Boston kind or size.  When its
     full nature burst upon the company&mdash;when the ears of the assembled
     diners heard the sacred names of Longfellow, Emerson, and Holmes
     lightly associated with human aspects removed&mdash;oh, very far removed
    &mdash;from Cambridge and Concord, a chill fell upon the diners that
     presently became amazement, and then creeping paralysis.  Nobody
     knew afterward whether the great speech that he had so gaily planned
     ever came to a natural end or not.  Somebody&mdash;the next on the
     program&mdash;attempted to follow him, but presently the company melted
     out of the doors and crept away into the night.

     It seemed to Mark Twain that his career had come to an end.  Back in
     Hartford, sweating and suffering through sleepless nights, he wrote
     Howells his anguish.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;My sense of disgrace does not abate. It grows. I
      see that it is going to add itself to my list of permanencies&mdash;a list
      of humiliations that extends back to when I was seven years old, and which
      keep on persecuting me regardless of my repentancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel that my misfortune has injured me all over the country; therefore
      it will be best that I retire from before the public at present. It will
      hurt the Atlantic for me to appear in its pages, now. So it is my opinion
      and my wife&rsquo;s that the telephone story had better be suppressed.
      Will you return those proofs or revises to me, so that I can use the same
      on some future occasion?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems as if I must have been insane when I wrote that speech and saw no
      harm in it, no disrespect toward those men whom I reverenced so much. And
      what shame I brought upon you, after what you said in introducing me! It
      burns me like fire to think of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole matter is a dreadful subject&mdash;let me drop it here&mdash;at
      least on paper.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         Penitently yrs,

</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Howells sent back a comforting letter.  &ldquo;I have no idea of dropping
     you out of the Atlantic,&rdquo; he wrote; &ldquo;and Mr. Houghton has still
     less, if possible.  You are going to help and not hurt us many a
     year yet, if you will....  You are not going to be floored by it;
     there is more justice than that, even in this world.&rdquo;

     Howells added that Charles Elliot Norton had expressed just the
     right feeling concerning the whole affair, and that many who had not
     heard the speech, but read the newspaper reports of it, had found it
     without offense.

     Clemens wrote contrite letters to Holmes, Emerson, and Longfellow,
     and received most gracious acknowledgments.  Emerson, indeed, had
     not heard the speech: His faculties were already blurred by the
     mental mists that would eventually shut him in.  Clemens wrote again
     to Howells, this time with less anguish.

                                             HARTFORD, Friday, 1877.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Your letter was a godsend; and perhaps the
      welcomest part of it was your consent that I write to those gentlemen; for
      you discouraged my hints in that direction that morning in Boston&mdash;rightly,
      too, for my offense was yet too new, then. Warner has tried to hold up our
      hands like the good fellow he is, but poor Twichell could not say a word,
      and confessed that he would rather take nearly any punishment than face
      Livy and me. He hasn&rsquo;t been here since.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is curious, but I pitched early upon Mr. Norton as the very man who
      would think some generous thing about that matter, whether he said it or
      not. It is splendid to be a man like that&mdash;but it is given to few to
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote a letter yesterday, and sent a copy to each of the three. I wanted
      to send a copy to Mr. Whittier also, since the offense was done also
      against him, being committed in his presence and he the guest of the
      occasion, besides holding the well-nigh sacred place he does in his people&rsquo;s
      estimation; but I didn&rsquo;t know whether to venture or not, and so
      ended by doing nothing. It seemed an intrusion to approach him, and even
      Livy seemed to have her doubts as to the best and properest way to do in
      the case. I do not reverence Mr. Emerson less, but somehow I could
      approach him easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Send me those proofs, if you have got them handy; I want to submit them to
      Wylie; he won&rsquo;t show them to anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had a very pleasant and considerate letter from Mr. Houghton, today, and
      was very glad to receive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can&rsquo;t imagine how brilliant and beautiful that new brass fender
      is, and how perfectly naturally it takes its place under the carved oak.
      How they did scour it up before they sent it! I lied a good deal about it
      when I came home&mdash;so for once I kept a secret and surprised Livy on a
      Christmas morning!
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven&rsquo;t done a stroke of work since the Atlantic dinner; have only
      moped around. But I&rsquo;m going to try tomorrow. How could I ever have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, well, I am a great and sublime fool. But then I am God&rsquo;s fool,
      and all His works must be contemplated with respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Livy and I join in the warmest regards to you and yours,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        Yrs ever,
                                                  MARK.

     Longfellow, in his reply, said: &ldquo;I do not believe anybody
     was much hurt. Certainly I was not, and Holmes tells me he
     was not. So I think you may dismiss the matter from your
     mind without further remorse.&rdquo;

     Holmes wrote: &ldquo;It never occurred to me for a moment to take
     offense, or feel wounded by your playful use of my name.&rdquo;

     Miss Ellen Emerson replied for her father (in a letter to
     Mrs. Clemens) that the speech had made no impression upon
     him, giving at considerable length the impression it had
     made on herself and other members of the family.

     Clearly, it was not the principals who were hurt, but only those who
     held them in awe, though one can realize that this would not make it
     much easier for Mark Twain.

      XVIII. LETTERS FROM EUROPE, 1878-79. TRAMPING WITH TWICHELL. WRITING A NEW
      TRAVEL BOOK. LIFE IN MUNICH.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Whether the unhappy occurrence at the Whittier dinner had anything
     to do with Mark Twain&rsquo;s resolve to spend a year or two in Europe
     cannot be known now.  There were other good reasons for going, one
     in particular being a demand for another book of travel.  It was
     also true, as he explains in a letter to his mother, that his days
     were full of annoyances, making it difficult for him to work.  He
     had a tendency to invest money in almost any glittering enterprise
     that came along, and at this time he was involved in the promotion
     of a variety of patent rights that brought him no return other than
     assessment and vexation.

     Clemens&rsquo;s mother was by this time living with her son Onion and his
     wife, in Iowa.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR MOTHER,&mdash;I suppose I am the worst correspondent in the whole
      world; and yet I grow worse and worse all the time. My conscience blisters
      me for not writing you, but it has ceased to abuse me for not writing
      other folks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life has come to be a very serious matter with me. I have a badgered,
      harassed feeling, a good part of my time. It comes mainly of business
      responsibilities and annoyances, and the persecution of kindly letters
      from well meaning strangers&mdash;to whom I must be rudely silent or else
      put in the biggest half of my time bothering over answers. There are other
      things also that help to consume my time and defeat my projects. Well, the
      consequence is, I cannot write a book at home. This cuts my income down.
      Therefore, I have about made up my mind to take my tribe and fly to some
      little corner of Europe and budge no more until I shall have completed one
      of the half dozen books that lie begun, up stairs. Please say nothing
      about this at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      We propose to sail the 11th of April. I shall go to Fredonia to meet you,
      but it will not be well for Livy to make that trip I am afraid. However,
      we shall see. I will hope she can go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Twichell has just come in, so I must go to him. We are all well, and
      send love to you all.

     He was writing few letters at this time, and doing but little work.
     There were always many social events during the winter, and what
     with his European plans and a diligent study of the German language,
     which the entire family undertook, his days and evenings were full
     enough.  Howells wrote protesting against the European travel and
     berating him for his silence:

     &ldquo;I never was in Berlin and don&rsquo;t know any family hotel there.
     I should be glad I didn&rsquo;t, if it would keep you from going.  You
     deserve to put up at the Sign of the Savage in Vienna.  Really, it&rsquo;s
     a great blow to me to hear of that prospected sojourn.  It&rsquo;s a
     shame.  I must see you, somehow, before you go.  I&rsquo;m in dreadfully
     low spirits about it.

     &ldquo;I was afraid your silence meant something wicked.&rdquo;

     Clemens replied promptly, urging a visit to Hartford, adding a
     postscript for Mrs. Howells, characteristic enough to warrant
     preservation.

DEAR MRS. HOWELLS. Mrs. Clemens wrote you a letter, and handed it to me
half an hour ago, while I was folding mine to Mr. Howells. I laid that
letter on this table before me while I added the paragraph about R,&lsquo;s
application. Since then I have been hunting and swearing, and swearing
and hunting, but I can&rsquo;t find a sign of that letter. It is the most
astonishing disappearance I ever heard of. Mrs. Clemens has gone off
driving&mdash;so I will have to try and give you an idea of her communication
from memory. Mainly it consisted of an urgent desire that you come to
see us next week, if you can possibly manage it, for that will be a
reposeful time, the turmoil of breaking up beginning the week after. She
wants you to tell her about Italy, and advise her in that connection, if
you will. Then she spoke of her plans&mdash;hers, mind you, for I never have
anything quite so definite as a plan. She proposes to stop a fortnight
in (confound the place, I&rsquo;ve forgotten what it was,) then go and live in
Dresden till sometime in the summer; then retire to Switzerland for the
hottest season, then stay a while in Venice and put in the winter
in Munich. This program subject to modifications according to
circumstances. She said something about some little by-trips here and
there, but they didn&rsquo;t stick in my memory because the idea didn&rsquo;t charm
me.

      (They have just telephoned me from the Courant office that Bayard Taylor
      and family have taken rooms in our ship, the Holsatia, for the 11th
      April.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Do come, if you possibly can!&mdash;and remember and don&rsquo;t forget to
      avoid letting Mrs. Clemens find out I lost her letter. Just answer her the
      same as if you had got it.

     The Howellses came, as invited, for a final reunion before the
     breaking up.  This was in the early half of March; the Clemenses
     were to sail on the 11th of the following month.

     Orion Clemens, meantime, had conceived a new literary idea and was
     piling in his MS. as fast as possible to get his brother&rsquo;s judgment
     on it before the sailing-date.  It was not a very good time to send
     MS., but Mark Twain seems to have read it and given it some
     consideration.  &ldquo;The Journey in Heaven,&rdquo; of his own, which he
     mentions, was the story published so many years later under the
     title of &ldquo;Captain Stormfield&rsquo;s Visit to Heaven.&rdquo;  He had began it in
     1868, on his voyage to San Francisco, it having been suggested by
     conversations with Capt.  Ned Wakeman, of one of the Pacific
     steamers.  Wakeman also appears in &lsquo;Roughing It,&rsquo; Chap.  L, as Capt.
     Ned Blakely, and again in one of the &ldquo;Rambling Notes of an Idle
     Excursion,&rdquo; as &ldquo;Captain Hurricane Jones.&rdquo;

                                             HARTFORD, Mch.  23, 1878.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR BRO.,&mdash;Every man must learn his trade&mdash;not pick it up.
      God requires that he learn it by slow and painful processes. The
      apprentice-hand, in black-smithing, in medicine, in literature, in
      everything, is a thing that can&rsquo;t be hidden. It always shows.
    </p>
    <p>
      But happily there is a market for apprentice work, else the &ldquo;Innocents
      Abroad&rdquo; would have had no sale. Happily, too, there&rsquo;s a wider
      market for some sorts of apprentice literature than there is for the very
      best of journey-work. This work of yours is exceedingly crude, but I am
      free to say it is less crude than I expected it to be, and considerably
      better work than I believed you could do, it is too crude to offer to any
      prominent periodical, so I shall speak to the N. Y. Weekly people. To
      publish it there will be to bury it. Why could not same good genius have
      sent me to the N. Y. Weekly with my apprentice sketches?
    </p>
    <p>
      You should not publish it in book form at all&mdash;for this reason: it is
      only an imitation of Verne&mdash;it is not a burlesque. But I think it may
      be regarded as proof that Verne cannot be burlesqued.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accompanying notes I have suggested that you vastly modify the first
      visit to hell, and leave out the second visit altogether. Nobody would, or
      ought to print those things. You are not advanced enough in literature to
      venture upon a matter requiring so much practice. Let me show you what a
      man has got to go through:
    </p>
    <p>
      Nine years ago I mapped out my &ldquo;Journey in Heaven.&rdquo; I
      discussed it with literary friends whom I could trust to keep it to
      themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave it a deal of thought, from time to time. After a year or more I
      wrote it up. It was not a success. Five years ago I wrote it again,
      altering the plan. That MS is at my elbow now. It was a considerable
      improvement on the first attempt, but still it wouldn&rsquo;t do&mdash;last
      year and year before I talked frequently with Howells about the subject,
      and he kept urging me to do it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I thought and thought, at odd moments and at last I struck what I
      considered to be the right plan! Mind I have never altered the ideas, from
      the first&mdash;the plan was the difficulty. When Howells was here last, I
      laid before him the whole story without referring to my MS and he said:
      &ldquo;You have got it sure this time. But drop the idea of making mere
      magazine stuff of it. Don&rsquo;t waste it. Print it by itself&mdash;publish
      it first in England&mdash;ask Dean Stanley to endorse it, which will draw
      some of the teeth of the religious press, and then reprint in America.&rdquo;
      I doubt my ability to get Dean Stanley to do anything of the sort, but I
      shall do the rest&mdash;and this is all a secret which you must not
      divulge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now look here&mdash;I have tried, all these years, to think of some way of
      &ldquo;doing&rdquo; hell too&mdash;and have always had to give it up.
      Hell, in my book, will not occupy five pages of MS I judge&mdash;it will
      be only covert hints, I suppose, and quickly dropped, I may end by not
      even referring to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And mind you, in my opinion you will find that you can&rsquo;t write up
      hell so it will stand printing. Neither Howells nor I believe in hell or
      the divinity of the Savior, but no matter, the Savior is none the less a
      sacred Personage, and a man should have no desire or disposition to refer
      to him lightly, profanely, or otherwise than with the profoundest
      reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only safe thing is not to introduce him, or refer to him at all, I
      suspect. I have entirely rewritten one book 3 (perhaps 4.) times, changing
      the plan every time&mdash;1200 pages of MS. wasted and burned&mdash;and
      shall tackle it again, one of these years and maybe succeed at last.
      Therefore you need not expect to get your book right the first time. Go to
      work and revamp or rewrite it. God only exhibits his thunder and lightning
      at intervals, and so they always command attention. These are God&rsquo;s
      adjectives. You thunder and lightning too much; the reader ceases to get
      under the bed, by and by.

      Mr. Perkins will send you and Ma your checks when we are gone. But don&rsquo;t
      write him, ever, except a single line in case he forgets the checks&mdash;for
      the man is driven to death with work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see you are half promising yourself a monthly return for your book. In
      my experience, previously counted chickens never do hatch. How many of
      mine I have counted! and never a one of them but failed! It is much better
      to hedge disappointment by not counting.&mdash;Unexpected money is a
      delight. The same sum is a bitterness when you expected more.
    </p>
    <p>
      My time in America is growing mighty short. Perhaps we can manage in this
      way: Imprimis, if the N. Y. Weekly people know that you are my brother,
      they will turn that fact into an advertisement&mdash;a thing of value to
      them, but not to you and me. This must be prevented. I will write them a
      note to say you have a friend near Keokuk, Charles S. Miller, who has a MS
      for sale which you think is a pretty clever travesty on Verne; and if they
      want it they might write to him in your care. Then if any correspondence
      ensues between you and them, let Mollie write for you and sign your name&mdash;your
      own hand writing representing Miller&rsquo;s. Keep yourself out of sight
      till you make a strike on your own merits there is no other way to get a
      fair verdict upon your merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later-I&rsquo;ve written the note to Smith, and with nothing in it which
      he can use as an advertisement. I&rsquo;m called&mdash;Good bye-love to
      you both.

     In the letter that follows the mention of Annie and Sam refers, of

     Charles L.  Webster, who later was to become Mark Twain&rsquo;s business
     partner.  The Moffetts and Websters were living in Fredonia at this
     time, and Clemens had been to pay them a good-by visit.  The Taylor
     dinner mentioned was a farewell banquet given to Bayard Taylor, who
     had been appointed Minister to Germany, and was to sail on the ship
     with Mark Twain.  Mark Twain&rsquo;s mother was visiting in Fredonia when
     this letter was written.

      To Mrs. Jane Clemens, in Fredonia:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                                  Apr.  7, &lsquo;78.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR MOTHER,&mdash;I have told Livy all about Annie&rsquo;s beautiful
      house, and about Sam and Charley, and about Charley&rsquo;s ingenious
      manufactures and his strong manhood and good promise, and how glad I am
      that he and Annie married. And I have told her about Annie&rsquo;s
      excellent house-keeping, also about the great Bacon conflict; (I told you
      it was a hundred to one that neither Livy nor the European powers had
      heard of that desolating struggle.)
    </p>
    <p>
      And I have told her how beautiful you are in your age and how bright your
      mind is with its old-time brightness, and how she and the children would
      enjoy you. And I have told her how singularly young Pamela is looking, and
      what a fine large fellow Sam is, and how ill the lingering syllable
      &ldquo;my&rdquo; to his name fits his port and figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, Pamela, after thinking it over for a day or so, I came near
      inquiring about a state-room in our ship for Sam, to please you, but my
      wiser former resolution came back to me. It is not for his good that he
      have friends in the ship. His conduct in the Bacon business shows that he
      will develop rapidly into a manly man as soon as he is cast loose from
      your apron strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don&rsquo;t teach him to push ahead and do and dare things for
      himself, but you do just the reverse. You are assisted in your damaging
      work by the tyrannous ways of a village&mdash;villagers watch each other
      and so make cowards of each other. After Sam shall have voyaged to Europe
      by himself, and rubbed against the world and taken and returned its cuffs,
      do you think he will hesitate to escort a guest into any whisky-mill in
      Fredonia when he himself has no sinful business to transact there? No, he
      will smile at the idea. If he avoids this courtesy now from principle, of
      course I find no fault with it at all&mdash;only if he thinks it is
      principle he may be mistaken; a close examination may show it is only a
      bowing to the tyranny of public opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      I only say it may&mdash;I cannot venture to say it will. Hartford is not a
      large place, but it is broader than to have ways of that sort. Three or
      four weeks ago, at a Moody and Sankey meeting, the preacher read a letter
      from somebody &ldquo;exposing&rdquo; the fact that a prominent clergyman
      had gone from one of those meetings, bought a bottle of lager beer and
      drank it on the premises (a drug store.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A tempest of indignation swept the town. Our clergymen and everybody else
      said the &ldquo;culprit&rdquo; had not only done an innocent thing, but
      had done it in an open, manly way, and it was nobody&rsquo;s right or
      business to find fault with it. Perhaps this dangerous latitude comes of
      the fact that we never have any temperance &ldquo;rot&rdquo; going on in
      Hartford.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find here a letter from Orion, submitting some new matter in his story
      for criticism. When you write him, please tell him to do the best he can
      and bang away. I can do nothing further in this matter, for I have but 3
      days left in which to settle a deal of important business and answer a
      bushel and a half of letters. I am very nearly tired to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was so jaded and worn, at the Taylor dinner, that I found I could not
      remember 3 sentences of the speech I had memorized, and therefore got up
      and said so and excused myself from speaking. I arrived here at 3 o&rsquo;clock
      this morning. I think the next 3 days will finish me. The idea of sitting
      down to a job of literary criticism is simply ludicrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young lady passenger in our ship has been placed under Livy&rsquo;s
      charge. Livy couldn&rsquo;t easily get out of it, and did not want to, on
      her own account, but fully expected I would make trouble when I heard of
      it. But I didn&rsquo;t. A girl can&rsquo;t well travel alone, so I offered
      no objection. She leaves us at Hamburg. So I&rsquo;ve got 6 people in my
      care, now&mdash;which is just 6 too many for a man of my unexecutive
      capacity. I expect nothing else but to lose some of them overboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      We send our loving good-byes to all the household and hope to see you
      again after a spell.

     There are no other American letters of this period.  The Clemens
     party, which included Miss Clara Spaulding, of Elmira, sailed as
     planned, on the Holsatia, April 11, 1878.  As before stated, Bayard
     Taylor was on the ship; also Murat Halstead and family.  On the eve
     of departure, Clemens sent to Howells this farewell word:

     &ldquo;And that reminds me, ungrateful dog that I am, that I owe as much
     to your training as the rude country job-printer owes to the city
     boss who takes him in hand and teaches him the right way to handle
     his art.  I was talking to Mrs. Clemens about this the other day,
     and grieving because I never mentioned it to you, thereby seeming to
     ignore it, or to be unaware of it.  Nothing that has passed under
     your eye needs any revision before going into a volume, while all my
     other stuff does need so much.&rdquo;

     A characteristic tribute, and from the heart.

     The first European letter came from Frankfort, a rest on their way
     to Heidelberg.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I only propose to write a single line to say we are
      still around. Ah, I have such a deep, grateful, unutterable sense of being
      &ldquo;out of it all.&rdquo; I think I foretaste some of the advantages of
      being dead. Some of the joy of it. I don&rsquo;t read any newspapers or
      care for them. When people tell me England has declared war, I drop the
      subject, feeling that it is none of my business; when they tell me Mrs.
      Tilton has confessed and Mr. B. denied, I say both of them have done that
      before, therefore let the worn stub of the Plymouth white-wash brush be
      brought out once more, and let the faithful spit on their hands and get to
      work again regardless of me&mdash;for I am out of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had 2 almost devilish weeks at sea (and I tell you Bayard Taylor is a
      really lovable man&mdash;which you already knew) then we staid a week in
      the beautiful, the very beautiful city of Hamburg; and since then we have
      been fooling along, 4 hours per day by rail, with a courier, spending the
      other 20 in hotels whose enormous bedchambers and private parlors are an
      overpowering marvel to me: Day before yesterday, in Cassel, we had a love
      of a bedroom, 31 feet long, and a parlor with 2 sofas, 12 chairs, a
      writing desk and 4 tables scattered around, here and there in it. Made of
      red silk, too, by George.
    </p>
    <p>
      The times and times I wish you were along! You could throw some fun into
      the journey; whereas I go on, day by day, in a smileless state of solemn
      admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a paradise this is! What clean clothes, what good faces, what
      tranquil contentment, what prosperity, what genuine freedom, what superb
      government. And I am so happy, for I am responsible for none of it. I am
      only here to enjoy. How charmed I am when I overhear a German word which I
      understand. With love from us 2 to you 2.

      P. S. We are not taking six days to go from Hamburg to Heidelberg because
      we prefer it. Quite on the contrary. Mrs. Clemens picked up a dreadful
      cold and sore throat on board ship and still keeps them in stock&mdash;so
      she could only travel 4 hours a day. She wanted to dive straight through,
      but I had different notions about the wisdom of it. I found that 4 hours a
      day was the best she could do. Before I forget it, our permanent address
      is Care Messrs. Koester &amp; Co., Backers, Heidelberg. We go there
      tomorrow.

      Poor Susy! From the day we reached German soil, we have required Rosa to
      speak German to the children&mdash;which they hate with all their souls.
      The other morning in Hanover, Susy came to us (from Rosa, in the nursery)
      and said, in halting syllables, &ldquo;Papa, vie viel uhr ist es?&rdquo;&mdash;then
      turned with pathos in her big eyes, and said, &ldquo;Mamma, I wish Rosa
      was made in English.&rdquo;

     Frankfort was a brief halting-place, their destination being
     Heidelberg.  They were presently located there in the beautiful
     Schloss hotel, which overlooks the old castle with its forest
     setting, the flowing Neckar, and the distant valley of the Rhine.
     Clemens, who had discovered the location, and loved it, toward the
     end of May reported to Howells his felicities.

      Fragment of a letter to W. D. Howells, in Boston:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                   SCHLOSS-HOTEL HEIDELBERG,

                                   Sunday, a. m., May 26, 1878.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;....divinely located. From this airy porch among
      the shining groves we look down upon Heidelberg Castle, and upon the swift
      Neckar, and the town, and out over the wide green level of the Rhine
      valley&mdash;a marvelous prospect. We are in a Cul-de-sac formed of
      hill-ranges and river; we are on the side of a steep mountain; the river
      at our feet is walled, on its other side, (yes, on both sides,) by a steep
      and wooded mountain-range which rises abruptly aloft from the water&rsquo;s
      edge; portions of these mountains are densely wooded; the plain of the
      Rhine, seen through the mouth of this pocket, has many and peculiar charms
      for the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our bedroom has two great glass bird-cages (enclosed balconies) one
      looking toward the Rhine valley and sunset, the other looking up the
      Neckar cul-de-sac, and naturally we spend nearly all our time in these&mdash;when
      one is sunny the other is shady. We have tables and chairs in them; we do
      our reading, writing, studying, smoking and suppering in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The view from these bird-cages is my despair. The pictures change from one
      enchanting aspect to another in ceaseless procession, never keeping one
      form half an hour, and never taking on an unlovely one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Heidelberg on a dark night! It is massed, away down there, almost
      right under us, you know, and stretches off toward the valley. Its curved
      and interlacing streets are a cobweb, beaded thick with lights&mdash;a
      wonderful thing to see; then the rows of lights on the arched bridges, and
      their glinting reflections in the water; and away at the far end, the
      Eisenbahnhof, with its twenty solid acres of glittering gas-jets, a huge
      garden, as one may say, whose every plant is a flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      These balconies are the darlingest things. I have spent all the morning in
      this north one. Counting big and little, it has 256 panes of glass in it;
      so one is in effect right out in the free sunshine, and yet sheltered from
      wind and rain&mdash;and likewise doored and curtained from whatever may be
      going on in the bedroom. It must have been a noble genius who devised this
      hotel. Lord, how blessed is the repose, the tranquillity of this place!
      Only two sounds; the happy clamor of the birds in the groves, and the
      muffled music of the Neckar, tumbling over the opposing dykes. It is no
      hardship to lie awake awhile, nights, for this subdued roar has exactly
      the sound of a steady rain beating upon a roof. It is so healing to the
      spirit; and it bears up the thread of one&rsquo;s imaginings as the
      accompaniment bears up a song.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Livy and Miss Spaulding have been writing at this table, I have sat
      tilted back, near by, with a pipe and the last Atlantic, and read Charley
      Warner&rsquo;s article with prodigious enjoyment. I think it is exquisite.
      I think it must be the roundest and broadest and completest short essay he
      has ever written. It is clear, and compact, and charmingly done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hotel grounds join and communicate with the Castle grounds; so we and
      the children loaf in the winding paths of those leafy vastnesses a great
      deal, and drink beer and listen to excellent music.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we first came to this hotel, a couple of weeks ago, I pointed to a
      house across the river, and said I meant to rent the centre room on the 3d
      floor for a work-room. Jokingly we got to speaking of it as my office; and
      amused ourselves with watching &ldquo;my people&rdquo; daily in their
      small grounds and trying to make out what we could of their dress, &amp;c.,
      without a glass. Well, I loafed along there one day and found on that
      house the only sign of the kind on that side of the river: &ldquo;Moblirte
      Wohnung zu Vermiethen!&rdquo; I went in and rented that very room which I
      had long ago selected. There was only one other room in the whole
      double-house unrented.
    </p>
    <p>
      (It occurs to me that I made a great mistake in not thinking to deliver a
      very bad German speech, every other sentence pieced out with English, at
      the Bayard Taylor banquet in New York. I think I could have made it one of
      the features of the occasion.)&mdash;[He used this plan at a gathering of
      the American students in Heidelberg, on July 4th, with great effect; so
      his idea was not wasted.]
    </p>
    <p>
      We left Hartford before the end of March, and I have been idle ever since.
      I have waited for a call to go to work&mdash;I knew it would come. Well,
      it began to come a week ago; my note-book comes out more and more
      frequently every day since; 3 days ago I concluded to move my manuscript
      over to my den. Now the call is loud and decided at last. So tomorrow I
      shall begin regular, steady work, and stick to it till middle of July or
      1st August, when I look for Twichell; we will then walk about Germany 2 or
      3 weeks, and then I&rsquo;ll go to work again&mdash;(perhaps in Munich.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We both send a power of love to the Howellses, and we do wish you were
      here. Are you in the new house? Tell us about it.

     There has been no former mention in the letters of the coming of
     Twichell; yet this had been a part of the European plan.  Mark Twain
     had invited his walking companion to make a tramp with him through
     Europe, as his guest.  Material for the new book would grow faster
     with Twichell as a companion; and these two in spite of their widely
     opposed views concerning Providence and the general scheme of
     creation, were wholly congenial comrades.  Twichell, in Hartford,
     expecting to receive the final summons to start, wrote: &ldquo;Oh, my! do
     you realize, Mark, what a symposium it is to be?  I do.  To begin
     with, I am thoroughly tired, and the rest will be worth everything.
     To walk with you and talk with you for weeks together&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s my
     dream of luxury.&rdquo;

     August 1st brought Twichell, and the friends set out without delay
     on a tramp through the Black Forest, making short excursions at
     first, but presently extending them in the direction of Switzerland.
     Mrs. Clemens and the others remained in Heidelberg, to follow at
     their leisure.  To Mrs. Clemens her husband sent frequent reports of
     their wanderings.  It will be seen that their tramp did not confine
     itself to pedestrianism, though they did, in fact, walk a great
     deal, and Mark Twain in a note to his mother declared, &ldquo;I loathe all
     travel, except on foot.&rdquo;  The reports to Mrs. Clemens follow:

    <p>
      Livy darling, we had a rattling good time to-day, but we came very near
      being left at Baden-Baden, for instead of waiting in the waiting-room, we
      sat down on the platform to wait where the trains come in from the other
      direction. We sat there full ten minutes&mdash;and then all of a sudden it
      occurred to me that that was not the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the train the principal of the big English school at Nauheim (of which
      Mr. Scheiding was a teacher), introduced himself to me, and then he mapped
      out our day for us (for today and tomorrow) and also drew a map and gave
      us directions how to proceed through Switzerland. He had his entire school
      with him, taking them on a prodigious trip through Switzerland&mdash;tickets
      for the round trip ten dollars apiece. He has done this annually for 10
      years. We took a post carriage from Aachen to Otterhofen for 7 marks&mdash;stopped
      at the &ldquo;Pflug&rdquo; to drink beer, and saw that pretty girl again
      at a distance. Her father, mother, and two brothers received me like an
      ancient customer and sat down and talked as long as I had any German left.
      The big room was full of red-vested farmers (the Gemeindrath of the
      district, with the Burgermeister at the head,) drinking beer and talking
      public business. They had held an election and chosen a new member and had
      been drinking beer at his expense for several hours. (It was intensely
      Black-foresty.)
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an Australian there (a student from Stuttgart or somewhere,) and
      Joe told him who I was and he laid himself out to make our course plain,
      for us&mdash;so I am certain we can&rsquo;t get lost between here and
      Heidelberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked the carriage road till we came to that place where one sees the
      foot path on the other side of the ravine, then we crossed over and took
      that. For a good while we were in a dense forest and judged we were lost,
      but met a native women who said we were all right. We fooled along and got
      there at 6 p.m.&mdash;ate supper, then followed down the ravine to the
      foot of the falls, then struck into a blind path to see where it would go,
      and just about dark we fetched up at the Devil&rsquo;s Pulpit on top of
      the hills. Then home. And now to bed, pretty sleepy. Joe sends love and I
      send a thousand times as much, my darling.

      Livy darling, we had a lovely day jogged right along, with a good horse
      and sensible driver&mdash;the last two hours right behind an open carriage
      filled with a pleasant German family&mdash;old gentleman and 3 pretty
      daughters. At table d&rsquo;hote tonight, 3 dishes were enough for me, and
      then I bored along tediously through the bill of fare, with a back-ache,
      not daring to get up and bow to the German family and leave. I meant to
      sit it through and make them get up and do the bowing; but at last Joe
      took pity on me and said he would get up and drop them a curtsy and put me
      out of my misery. I was grateful. He got up and delivered a succession of
      frank and hearty bows, accompanying them with an atmosphere of
      good-fellowship which would have made even an English family surrender. Of
      course the Germans responded&mdash;then I got right up and they had to
      respond to my salaams, too. So &ldquo;that was done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We walked up a gorge and saw a tumbling waterfall which was nothing to
      Giessbach, but it made me resolve to drop you a line and urge you to go
      and see Giessbach illuminated. Don&rsquo;t fail&mdash;but take a long day&rsquo;s
      rest, first. I love you, sweetheart.

    <p>
      Livy darling, Joe and I have had a most noble day. Started to climb (on
      foot) at 8.30 this morning among the grandest peaks! Every half hour
      carried us back a month in the season. We left them harvesting 2d crop of
      hay. At 9 we were in July and found ripe strawberries; at 9.30 we were in
      June and gathered flowers belonging to that month; at 10 we were in May
      and gathered a flower which appeared in Heidelberg the 17th of that month;
      also forget-me-nots, which disappeared from Heidelberg about mid-May; at
      11.30 we were in April (by the flowers;) at noon we had rain and hail
      mixed, and wind and enveloping fogs, and considered it March; at 12.30 we
      had snowbanks above us and snowbanks below us, and considered it February.
      Not good February, though, because in the midst of the wild desolation the
      forget-me-not still bloomed, lovely as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a flower garden the Gemmi Pass is! After I had got my hands full Joe
      made me a paper bag, which I pinned to my lapel and filled with choice
      specimens. I gathered no flowers which I had ever gathered before except 4
      or 5 kinds. We took it leisurely and I picked all I wanted to. I mailed my
      harvest to you a while ago. Don&rsquo;t send it to Mrs. Brooks until you
      have looked it over, flower by flower. It will pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the clouds and everlasting snows I found a brave and bright little
      forget-me-not growing in the very midst of a smashed and tumbled
      stone-debris, just as cheerful as if the barren and awful domes and
      ramparts that towered around were the blessed walls of heaven. I thought
      how Lilly Warner would be touched by such a gracious surprise, if she,
      instead of I, had seen it. So I plucked it, and have mailed it to her with
      a note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our walk was 7 hours&mdash;the last 2 down a path as steep as a ladder,
      almost, cut in the face of a mighty precipice. People are not allowed to
      ride down it. This part of the day&rsquo;s work taxed our knees, I tell
      you. We have been loafing about this village (Leukerbad) for an hour, now
      we stay here over Sunday. Not tired at all. (Joe&rsquo;s hat fell over the
      precipice&mdash;so he came here bareheaded.) I love you, my darling.

      Livy darling, we came through a-whooping today, 6 hours tramp up steep
      hills and down steep hills, in mud and water shoe-deep, and in a steady
      pouring rain which never moderated a moment. I was as chipper and fresh as
      a lark all the way and arrived without the slightest sense of fatigue. But
      we were soaked and my shoes full of water, so we ate at once, stripped and
      went to bed for 2 1/2 hours while our traps were thoroughly dried, and our
      boots greased in addition. Then we put our clothes on hot and went to
      table d&rsquo;hote.

      I have just telegraphed you to wire the family news to me at Riffel

     This, as far as it goes, is a truer and better account of the
     excursion than Mark Twain gave in the book that he wrote later.  A
     Tramp Abroad has a quality of burlesque in it, which did not belong
     to the journey at all, but was invented to satisfy the craving for
     what the public conceived to be Mark Twain&rsquo;s humor.  The serious
     portions of the book are much more pleasing&mdash;more like himself.
     The entire journey, as will be seen, lasted one week more than a
     month.

     Twichell also made his reports home, some of which give us
     interesting pictures of his walking partner.  In one place he wrote:
     &ldquo;Mark is a queer fellow.  There is nothing he so delights in as a
     swift, strong stream.  You can hardly get him to leave one when once
     he is within the influence of its fascinations.&rdquo;

     Twichell tells how at Kandersteg they were out together one evening
     where a brook comes plunging down from Gasternthal and how he pushed
     in a drift to see it go racing along the current.  &ldquo;When I got back
     to the path Mark was running down stream after it as hard as he
     could go, throwing up his hands and shouting in the wildest ecstasy,
     and when a piece went over a fall and emerged to view in the foam
     below he would jump up and down and yell.  He said afterward that he
     had not been so excited in three months.&rdquo;

     In other places Twichell refers to his companion&rsquo;s consideration for
     the feeling of others, and for animals.  &ldquo;When we are driving, his
     concern is all about the horse.  He can&rsquo;t bear to see the whip used,
     or to see a horse pull hard.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      After the walk over Gemmi Pass he wrote: &ldquo;Mark to-day was immensely
      absorbed in flowers. He scrambled around and gathered a great variety, and
      manifested the intensest pleasure in them. He crowded a pocket of his
      note-book with his specimens, and wanted more room.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Twichell got out his needle and thread and some stiff paper he
      had and contrived the little paper bag to hang to the front of his vest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tramp really ended at Lausanne, where Clemens joined his party, but a
      short excursion to Chillon and Chamonix followed, the travelers finally
      separating at Geneva, Twichell to set out for home by way of England,
      Clemens to remain and try to write the story of their travels. He hurried
      a good-by letter after his comrade:

    <p>
      DEAR OLD JOE,&mdash;It is actually all over! I was so low-spirited at the
      station yesterday, and this morning, when I woke, I couldn&rsquo;t seem to
      accept the dismal truth that you were really gone, and the pleasant
      tramping and talking at an end. Ah, my boy! it has been such a rich
      holiday to me, and I feel under such deep and honest obligations to you
      for coming. I am putting out of my mind all memory of the times when I
      misbehaved toward you and hurt you: I am resolved to consider it forgiven,
      and to store up and remember only the charming hours of the journeys and
      the times when I was not unworthy to be with you and share a companionship
      which to me stands first after Livy&rsquo;s. It is justifiable to do this;
      for why should I let my small infirmities of disposition live and grovel
      among my mental pictures of the eternal sublimities of the Alps?
    </p>
    <p>
      Livy can&rsquo;t accept or endure the fact that you are gone. But you are,
      and we cannot get around it. So take our love with you, and bear it also
      over the sea to Harmony, and God bless you both.

     From Switzerland the Clemens party worked down into Italy,
     sight-seeing, a diversion in which Mark Twain found little enough of
     interest.  He had seen most of the sights ten years before, when his
     mind was fresh.  He unburdened himself to Twichell and to Howells,
     after a period of suffering.

</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR JOE,&mdash;.....I have received your several letters, and we have
      prodigiously enjoyed them. How I do admire a man who can sit down and
      whale away with a pen just the same as if it was fishing&mdash;or
      something else as full of pleasure and as void of labor. I can&rsquo;t do
      it; else, in common decency, I would when I write to you. Joe, if I can
      make a book out of the matter gathered in your company over here, the book
      is safe; but I don&rsquo;t think I have gathered any matter before or
      since your visit worth writing up. I do wish you were in Rome to do my
      sightseeing for me. Rome interests me as much as East Hartford could, and
      no more. That is, the Rome which the average tourist feels an interest in;
      but there are other things here which stir me enough to make life worth
      living. Livy and Clara Spaulding are having a royal time worshiping the
      old Masters, and I as good a time gritting my ineffectual teeth over them.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     In his letter to Howells he said: &ldquo;I wish I could give those sharp
     satires on European life which you mention, but of course a man
     can&rsquo;t write successful satire except he be in a calm, judicial
     good-humor; whereas I hate travel, and I hate hotels, and I hate the
     opera, and I hate the old masters.  In truth, I don&rsquo;t ever seem to
     be in a good-enough humor with anything to satirize it.  No, I want
     to stand up before it and curse it and foam at the mouth, or take a
     club and pound it to rags and pulp.  I have got in two or three
     chapters about Wagner&rsquo;s operas, and managed to do it without showing
     temper, but the strain of another such effort would burst me!&rdquo;

     From Italy the Clemens party went to Munich, where they had arranged
     in advance for winter quarters.  Clemens claims, in his report of
     the matter to Howells, that he took the party through without the
     aid of a courier, though thirty years later, in some comment which
     he set down on being shown the letter, he wrote concerning this
     paragraph: &ldquo;Probably a lie.&rdquo;  He wrote, also, that they acquired a
     great affection for Fraulein Dahlweiner: &ldquo;Acquired it at once and it
     outlasted the winter we spent in her house.&rdquo;

                                   MUNICH, Nov. 17, 1878.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;We arrived here night before last, pretty well
      fagged: an 8-hour pull from Rome to Florence; a rest there of a day and
      two nights; then 5 1/2 hours to Bologna; one night&rsquo;s rest; then from
      noon to 10:30 p.m. carried us to Trent, in the Austrian Tyrol, where the
      confounded hotel had not received our message, and so at that miserable
      hour, in that snowy region, the tribe had to shiver together in fireless
      rooms while beds were prepared and warmed, then up at 6 in the morning and
      a noble view of snow-peaks glittering in the rich light of a full moon
      while the hotel-devils lazily deranged a breakfast for us in the dreary
      gloom of blinking candles; then a solid 12 hours pull through the
      loveliest snow ranges and snow-draped forest&mdash;and at 7 p.m. we hauled
      up, in drizzle and fog, at the domicile which had been engaged for us ten
      months before. Munich did seem the horriblest place, the most desolate
      place, the most unendurable place!&mdash;and the rooms were so small, the
      conveniences so meagre, and the porcelain stoves so grim, ghastly, dismal,
      intolerable! So Livy and Clara (Spaulding) sat down forlorn, and cried,
      and I retired to a private, place to pray. By and by we all retired to our
      narrow German beds; and when Livy and I finished talking across the room,
      it was all decided that we would rest 24 hours then pay whatever damages
      were required, and straightway fly to the south of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you see, that was simply fatigue. Next morning the tribe fell in love
      with the rooms, with the weather, with Munich, and head over heels in love
      with Fraulein Dahlweiner. We got a larger parlor&mdash;an ample one&mdash;threw
      two communicating bedrooms into one, for the children, and now we are
      entirely comfortable. The only apprehension, at present, is that the
      climate may not be just right for the children, in which case we shall
      have to go to France, but it will be with the sincerest regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I brought the tribe through from Rome, myself. We never had so little
      trouble before. The next time anybody has a courier to put out to nurse, I
      shall not be in the market.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last night the forlornities had all disappeared; so we gathered around the
      lamp, after supper, with our beer and my pipe, and in a condition of
      grateful snugness tackled the new magazines. I read your new story aloud,
      amid thunders of applause, and we all agreed that Captain Jenness and the
      old man with the accordion-hat are lovely people and most skillfully drawn&mdash;and
      that cabin-boy, too, we like. Of course we are all glad the girl is gone
      to Venice&mdash;for there is no place like Venice. Now I easily understand
      that the old man couldn&rsquo;t go, because you have a purpose in sending
      Lyddy by herself: but you could send the old man over in another ship, and
      we particularly want him along. Suppose you don&rsquo;t need him there?
      What of that? Can&rsquo;t you let him feed the doves? Can&rsquo;t you let
      him fall in the canal occasionally? Can&rsquo;t you let his good-natured
      purse be a daily prey to guides and beggar-boys? Can&rsquo;t you let him
      find peace and rest and fellowship under Pere Jacopo&rsquo;s kindly wing?
      (However, you are writing the book, not I&mdash;still, I am one of the
      people you are writing it for, you understand.) I only want to insist, in
      a friendly way, that the old man shall shed his sweet influence frequently
      upon the page&mdash;that is all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time we called at the convent, Pere Jacopo was absent; the next
      (Just at this moment Miss Spaulding spoke up and said something about Pere
      Jacopo&mdash;there is more in this acting of one mind upon another than
      people think) time, he was there, and gave us preserved rose-leaves to
      eat, and talked about you, and Mrs. Howells, and Winnie, and brought out
      his photographs, and showed us a picture of &ldquo;the library of your new
      house,&rdquo; but not so&mdash;it was the study in your Cambridge house.
      He was very sweet and good. He called on us next day; the day after that
      we left Venice, after a pleasant sojourn Of 3 or 4 weeks. He expects to
      spend this winter in Munich and will see us often, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty soon, I am going to write something, and when I finish it I shall
      know whether to put it to itself or in the &ldquo;Contributors&rsquo;
      Club.&rdquo; That &ldquo;Contributors&rsquo; Club&rdquo; was a most happy
      idea. By the way, I think that the man who wrote the paragraph beginning
      at the bottom of page 643 has said a mighty sound and sensible thing. I
      wish his suggestion could be adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is lovely of you to keep that old pipe in such a place of honor.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it occurs to me, I must tell you Susie&rsquo;s last. She is sorely
      badgered with dreams; and her stock dream is that she is being eaten up by
      bears. She is a grave and thoughtful child, as you will remember. Last
      night she had the usual dream. This morning she stood apart (after telling
      it,) for some time, looking vacantly at the floor, and absorbed in
      meditation. At last she looked up, and with the pathos of one who feels he
      has not been dealt by with even-handed fairness, said &ldquo;But Mamma,
      the trouble is, that I am never the bear, but always the person.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not have occurred to me that there might be an advantage, even in
      a dream, in occasionally being the eater, instead of always the party
      eaten, but I easily perceived that her point was well taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m sending to Heidelberg for your letter and Winnie&rsquo;s, and I
      do hope they haven&rsquo;t been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      My wife and I send love to you all.

     The Howells story, running at this time in the Atlantic, and so much

     suggestions made for enlarging the part of the &ldquo;old man&rdquo; are
     eminently characteristic.

     Mark Twain&rsquo;s forty-third birthday came in Munich, and in his letter
     conveying this fact to his mother we get a brief added outline of
     the daily life in that old Bavarian city.  Certainly, it would seem
     to have been a quieter and more profitable existence than he had
     known amid the confusion of things left behind in, America.

    <p>
      MY DEAR MOTHER AND SISTER,&mdash;I broke the back of life yesterday and
      started down-hill toward old age. This fact has not produced any effect
      upon me that I can detect.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose we are located here for the winter. I have a pleasant work-room
      a mile from here where I do my writing. The walk to and from that place
      gives me what exercise I need, and all I take. We staid three weeks in
      Venice, a week in Florence, a fortnight in Rome, and arrived here a couple
      of weeks ago. Livy and Miss Spaulding are studying drawing and German, and
      the children have a German day-governess. I cannot see but that the
      children speak German as well as they do English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susie often translates Livy&rsquo;s orders to the servants. I cannot work
      and study German at the same time: so I have dropped the latter, and do
      not even read the language, except in the morning paper to get the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have all pretty good health, latterly, and have seldom had to call the
      doctor. The children have been in the open air pretty constantly for
      months now. In Venice they were on the water in the gondola most of the
      time, and were great friends with our gondolier; and in Rome and Florence
      they had long daily tramps, for Rosa is a famous hand to smell out the
      sights of a strange place. Here they wander less extensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family all join in love to you all and to Orion and Mollie.

      XIX. LETTERS 1879. RETURN TO AMERICA. THE GREAT GRANT REUNION
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Life went on very well in Munich.  Each day the family fell
     more in love with Fraulein Dahlweiner and her house.

     Mark Twain, however, did not settle down to his work
     readily.  His &ldquo;pleasant work-room&rdquo; provided exercise, but no
     inspiration.  When he discovered he could not find his Swiss
     note-book he was ready to give up his travel-writing
     altogether.  In the letter that follows we find him much
     less enthusiastic concerning his own performances than over
     the story by Howells, which he was following in the
     Atlantic.

     The &ldquo;detective&rdquo; chapter mentioned in this letter was not
     included in &lsquo;A Tramp Abroad.&rsquo;  It was published separately,
     as &lsquo;The Stolen White Elephant&rsquo; in a volume bearing that
     title.  The play, which he had now found &ldquo;dreadfully witless
     and flat,&rdquo; was no other than &ldquo;Simon Wheeler, Detective,&rdquo;
      which he had once regarded so highly.  The &ldquo;Stewart&rdquo;
      referred to was the millionaire merchant, A. T. Stewart,
     whose body was stolen in the expectation of reward.

    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;It&rsquo;s no use, your letter miscarried in some
      way and is lost. The consul has made a thorough search and says he has not
      been able to trace it. It is unaccountable, for all the letters I did not
      want arrived without a single grateful failure. Well, I have read-up, now,
      as far as you have got, that is, to where there&rsquo;s a storm at sea
      approaching,&mdash;and we three think you are clear, out-Howellsing
      Howells. If your literature has not struck perfection now we are not able
      to see what is lacking. It is all such truth&mdash;truth to the life;
      every where your pen falls it leaves a photograph. I did imagine that
      everything had been said about life at sea that could be said, but no
      matter, it was all a failure and lies, nothing but lies with a thin
      varnish of fact,&mdash;only you have stated it as it absolutely is. And
      only you see people and their ways, and their insides and outsides as they
      are, and make them talk as they do talk. I think you are the very greatest
      artist in these tremendous mysteries that ever lived. There doesn&rsquo;t
      seem to be anything that can be concealed from your awful all-seeing eye.
      It must be a cheerful thing for one to live with you and be aware that you
      are going up and down in him like another conscience all the time.
      Possibly you will not be a fully accepted classic until you have been dead
      a hundred years,&mdash;it is the fate of the Shakespeares and of all
      genuine prophets,&mdash;but then your books will be as common as Bibles, I
      believe. You&rsquo;re not a weed, but an oak; not a summer-house, but a
      cathedral. In that day I shall still be in the Cyclopedias, too, thus:
      &ldquo;Mark Twain; history and occupation unknown&mdash;but he was
      personally acquainted with Howells.&rdquo; There&mdash;I could sing your
      praises all day, and feel and believe every bit of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My book is half finished; I wish to heaven it was done. I have given up
      writing a detective novel&mdash;can&rsquo;t write a novel, for I lack the
      faculty; but when the detectives were nosing around after Stewart&rsquo;s
      loud remains, I threw a chapter into my present book in which I have very
      extravagantly burlesqued the detective business&mdash;if it is possible to
      burlesque that business extravagantly. You know I was going to send you
      that detective play, so that you could re-write it. Well I didn&rsquo;t do
      it because I couldn&rsquo;t find a single idea in it that could be useful
      to you. It was dreadfully witless and flat. I knew it would sadden you and
      unfit you for work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have always been sorry we threw up that play embodying Orion which you
      began. It was a mistake to do that. Do keep that MS and tackle it again.
      It will work out all right; you will see. I don&rsquo;t believe that that
      character exists in literature in so well-developed a condition as it
      exists in Orion&rsquo;s person. Now won&rsquo;t you put Orion in a story?
      Then he will go handsomely into a play afterwards. How deliciously you
      could paint him&mdash;it would make fascinating reading&mdash;the sort
      that makes a reader laugh and cry at the same time, for Orion is as good
      and ridiculous a soul as ever was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, to think of Bayard Taylor! It is too sad to talk about. I was so glad
      there was not a single sting and so many good praiseful words in the
      Atlantic&rsquo;s criticism of Deukalion.

     In &lsquo;A Tramp Abroad&rsquo; there is an incident in which the author
     describes himself as hunting for a lost sock in the dark, in a vast
     hotel bedroom at Heilbronn.  The account of the real incident, as
     written to Twichell, seems even more amusing.

     The &ldquo;Yarn About the Limburger Cheese and the Box of Guns,&rdquo; like &ldquo;The
     Stolen White Elephant,&rdquo; did not find place in the travel-book, but
     was published in the same volume with the elephant story, added to
     the rambling notes of &ldquo;An Idle Excursion.&rdquo;

     With the discovery of the Swiss note-book, work with Mark Twain was
     going better.  His letter reflects his enthusiasm.

    <p>
      DEAR OLD JOE,&mdash;Sunday. Your delicious letter arrived exactly at the
      right time. It was laid by my plate as I was finishing breakfast at 12
      noon. Livy and Clara, (Spaulding) arrived from church 5 minutes later; I
      took a pipe and spread myself out on the sofa, and Livy sat by and read,
      and I warmed to that butcher the moment he began to swear. There is more
      than one way of praying, and I like the butcher&rsquo;s way because the
      petitioner is so apt to be in earnest. I was peculiarly alive to his
      performance just at this time, for another reason, to wit: Last night I
      awoke at 3 this morning, and after raging to my self for 2 interminable
      hours, I gave it up. I rose, assumed a catlike stealthiness, to keep from
      waking Livy, and proceeded to dress in the pitch dark. Slowly but surely I
      got on garment after garment&mdash;all down to one sock; I had one slipper
      on and the other in my hand. Well, on my hands and knees I crept softly
      around, pawing and feeling and scooping along the carpet, and among
      chair-legs for that missing sock; I kept that up; and still kept it up and
      kept it up. At first I only said to myself, &ldquo;Blame that sock,&rdquo;
      but that soon ceased to answer; my expletives grew steadily stronger and
      stronger,&mdash;and at last, when I found I was lost, I had to sit flat
      down on the floor and take hold of something to keep from lifting the roof
      off with the profane explosion that was trying to get out of me. I could
      see the dim blur of the window, but of course it was in the wrong place
      and could give me no information as to where I was. But I had one comfort&mdash;I
      had not waked Livy; I believed I could find that sock in silence if the
      night lasted long enough. So I started again and softly pawed all over the
      place,&mdash;and sure enough at the end of half an hour I laid my hand on
      the missing article. I rose joyfully up and butted the wash-bowl and
      pitcher off the stand and simply raised&mdash;&mdash;so to speak. Livy
      screamed, then said, &ldquo;Who is that? what is the matter?&rdquo; I said
      &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t anything the matter&mdash;I&rsquo;m hunting for
      my sock.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Are you hunting for it with a club?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I went in the parlor and lit the lamp, and gradually the fury subsided and
      the ridiculous features of the thing began to suggest themselves. So I lay
      on the sofa, with note-book and pencil, and transferred the adventure to
      our big room in the hotel at Heilbronn, and got it on paper a good deal to
      my satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found the Swiss note-book, some time ago. When it was first lost I was
      glad of it, for I was getting an idea that I had lost my faculty of
      writing sketches of travel; therefore the loss of that note-book would
      render the writing of this one simply impossible, and let me gracefully
      out; I was about to write to Bliss and propose some other book, when the
      confounded thing turned up, and down went my heart into my boots. But
      there was now no excuse, so I went solidly to work&mdash;tore up a great
      part of the MS written in Heidelberg,&mdash;wrote and tore up,&mdash;continued
      to write and tear up,&mdash;and at last, reward of patient and noble
      persistence, my pen got the old swing again!
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then I&rsquo;m glad Providence knew better what to do with the Swiss
      note-book than I did, for I like my work, now, exceedingly, and often turn
      out over 30 MS pages a day and then quit sorry that Heaven makes the days
      so short.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my discouragements had been the belief that my interest in this
      tour had been so slender that I couldn&rsquo;t gouge matter enough out of
      it to make a book. What a mistake. I&rsquo;ve got 900 pages written (not a
      word in it about the sea voyage) yet I stepped my foot out of Heidelberg
      for the first time yesterday,&mdash;and then only to take our party of
      four on our first pedestrian tour&mdash;to Heilbronn. I&rsquo;ve got them
      dressed elaborately in walking costume&mdash;knapsacks, canteens,
      field-glasses, leather leggings, patent walking shoes, muslin folds around
      their hats, with long tails hanging down behind, sun umbrellas, and
      Alpenstocks. They go all the way to Wimpfen by rail-thence to Heilbronn in
      a chance vegetable cart drawn by a donkey and a cow; I shall fetch them
      home on a raft; and if other people shall perceive that that was no
      pedestrian excursion, they themselves shall not be conscious of it.&mdash;This
      trip will take 100 pages or more,&mdash;oh, goodness knows how many! for
      the mood is everything, not the material, and I already seem to see 300
      pages rising before me on that trip. Then, I propose to leave Heidelberg
      for good. Don&rsquo;t you see, the book (1800 MS pages,) may really be
      finished before I ever get to Switzerland?
    </p>
    <p>
      But there&rsquo;s one thing; I want to tell Frank Bliss and his father to
      be charitable toward me in,&mdash;that is, let me tear up all the MS I
      want to, and give me time to write more. I shan&rsquo;t waste the time&mdash;I
      haven&rsquo;t the slightest desire to loaf, but a consuming desire to
      work, ever since I got back my swing. And you see this book is either
      going to be compared with the Innocents Abroad, or contrasted with it, to
      my disadvantage. I think I can make a book that will be no dead corpse of
      a thing and I mean to do my level best to accomplish that.
    </p>
    <p>
      My crude plans are crystalizing. As the thing stands now, I went to Europe
      for three purposes. The first you know, and must keep secret, even from
      the Blisses; the second is to study Art; and the third to acquire a
      critical knowledge of the German language. My MS already shows that the
      two latter objects are accomplished. It shows that I am moving about as an
      Artist and a Philologist, and unaware that there is any immodesty in
      assuming these titles. Having three definite objects has had the effect of
      seeming to enlarge my domain and give me the freedom of a loose costume.
      It is three strings to my bow, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, your butcher is magnificent. He won&rsquo;t stay out of my mind.&mdash;I
      keep trying to think of some way of getting your account of him into my
      book without his being offended&mdash;and yet confound him there isn&rsquo;t
      anything you have said which he would see any offense in,&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      only thinking of his friends&mdash;they are the parties who busy
      themselves with seeing things for people. But I&rsquo;m bound to have him
      in. I&rsquo;m putting in the yarn about the Limburger cheese and the box
      of guns, too&mdash;mighty glad Howells declined it. It seems to gather
      richness and flavor with age. I have very nearly killed several companies
      with that narrative,&mdash;the American Artists Club, here, for instance,
      and Smith and wife and Miss Griffith (they were here in this house a week
      or two.) I&rsquo;ve got other chapters that pretty nearly destroyed the
      same parties, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      O, Switzerland! the further it recedes into the enriching haze of time,
      the more intolerably delicious the charm of it and the cheer of it and the
      glory and majesty and solemnity and pathos of it grow. Those mountains had
      a soul; they thought; they spoke,&mdash;one couldn&rsquo;t hear it with
      the ears of the body, but what a voice it was!&mdash;and how real. Deep
      down in my memory it is sounding yet. Alp calleth unto Alp!&mdash;that
      stately old Scriptural wording is the right one for God&rsquo;s Alps and
      God&rsquo;s ocean. How puny we were in that awful presence&mdash;and how
      painless it was to be so; how fitting and right it seemed, and how
      stingless was the sense of our unspeakable insignificance. And Lord how
      pervading were the repose and peace and blessedness that poured out of the
      heart of the invisible Great Spirit of the Mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what is it? There are mountains and mountains and mountains in this
      world&mdash;but only these take you by the heart-strings. I wonder what
      the secret of it is. Well, time and time again it has seemed to me that I
      must drop everything and flee to Switzerland once more. It is a longing&mdash;a
      deep, strong, tugging longing&mdash;that is the word. We must go again,
      Joe.&mdash;October days, let us get up at dawn and breakfast at the tower.
      I should like that first rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Livy and all of us send deluges of love to you and Harmony and all the
      children. I dreamed last night that I woke up in the library at home and
      your children were frolicing around me and Julia was sitting in my lap;
      you and Harmony and both families of Warners had finished their welcomes
      and were filing out through the conservatory door, wrecking Patrick&rsquo;s
      flower pots with their dress skirts as they went. Peace and plenty abide

     Following the life of Mark Twain, whether through his letters or
     along the sequence of detailed occurrence, we are never more than a
     little while, or a little distance, from his brother Orion.  In one
     form or another Orion is ever present, his inquiries, his proposals,
     his suggestions, his plans for improving his own fortunes, command
     our attention.  He was one of the most human creatures that ever
     lived; indeed, his humanity excluded every form of artificiality
     &mdash;everything that needs to be acquired.  Talented, trusting,
     child-like, carried away by the impulse of the moment, despite a
     keen sense of humor he was never able to see that his latest plan
     or project was not bound to succeed.  Mark Twain loved him, pitied
     him&mdash;also enjoyed him, especially with Howells.  Orion&rsquo;s new plan
     to lecture in the interest of religion found its way to Munich,
     with the following result:

      To W. D. Howells, in Boston:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        MUNICH, Feb. 9.  (1879)
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I have just received this letter from Orion&mdash;take
      care of it, for it is worth preserving. I got as far as 9 pages in my
      answer to it, when Mrs. Clemens shut down on it, and said it was cruel,
      and made me send the money and simply wish his lecture success. I said I
      couldn&rsquo;t lose my 9 pages&mdash;so she said send them to you. But I
      will acknowledge that I thought I was writing a very kind letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now just look at this letter of Orion&rsquo;s. Did you ever see the
      grotesquely absurd and the heart-breakingly pathetic more closely joined
      together? Mrs. Clemens said &ldquo;Raise his monthly pension.&rdquo; So I
      wrote to Perkins to raise it a trifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now only think of it! He still has 100 pages to write on his lecture, yet
      in one inking of his pen he has already swooped around the United States
      and invested the result!
    </p>
    <p>
      You must put him in a book or a play right away. You are the only man
      capable of doing it. You might die at any moment, and your very greatest
      work would be lost to the world. I could write Orion&rsquo;s simple
      biography, and make it effective, too, by merely stating the bald facts&mdash;and
      this I will do if he dies before I do; but you must put him into romance.
      This was the understanding you and I had the day I sailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Observe Orion&rsquo;s career&mdash;that is, a little of it: (1) He has
      belonged to as many as five different religious denominations; last March
      he withdrew from the deaconship in a Congregational Church and the
      Superintendency of its Sunday School, in a speech in which he said that
      for many months (it runs in my mind that he said 13 years,) he had been a
      confirmed infidel, and so felt it to be his duty to retire from the flock.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. After being a republican for years, he wanted me to buy him a
      democratic newspaper. A few days before the Presidential election, he came
      out in a speech and publicly went over to the democrats; he prudently
      &ldquo;hedged&rdquo; by voting for 6 state republicans, also.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new convert was made one of the secretaries of the democratic meeting,
      and placed in the list of speakers. He wrote me jubilantly of what a
      ten-strike he was going to make with that speech. All right&mdash;but
      think of his innocent and pathetic candor in writing me something like
      this, a week later:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was more diffident than I had expected to be, and this was
      increased by the silence with which I was received when I came forward; so
      I seemed unable to get the fire into my speech which I had calculated
      upon, and presently they began to get up and go out; and in a few minutes
      they all rose up and went away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      How could a man uncover such a sore as that and show it to another? Not a
      word of complaint, you see&mdash;only a patient, sad surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. His next project was to write a burlesque upon Paradise Lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Then, learning that the Times was paying Harte $100 a column for
      stories, he concluded to write some for the same price. I read his first
      one and persuaded him not to write any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. Then he read proof on the N. Y. Eve. Post at $10 a week and meekly
      observed that the foreman swore at him and ordered him around &ldquo;like
      a steamboat mate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Being discharged from that post, he wanted to try agriculture&mdash;was
      sure he could make a fortune out of a chicken farm. I gave him $900 and he
      went to a ten-house village a miles above Keokuk on the river bank&mdash;this
      place was a railway station. He soon asked for money to buy a horse and
      light wagon,&mdash;because the trains did not run at church time on Sunday
      and his wife found it rather far to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time I answered demands for &ldquo;loans&rdquo; and by next
      mail always received his check for the interest due me to date. In the
      most guileless way he let it leak out that he did not underestimate the
      value of his custom to me, since it was not likely that any other customer
      of mine paid his interest quarterly, and this enabled me to use my capital
      twice in 6 months instead of only once. But alas, when the debt at last
      reached $1800 or $2500 (I have forgotten which) the interest ate too
      formidably into his borrowings, and so he quietly ceased to pay it or
      speak of it. At the end of two years I found that the chicken farm had
      long ago been abandoned, and he had moved into Keokuk. Later in one of his
      casual moments, he observed that there was no money in fattening a chicken
      on 65 cents worth of corn and then selling it for 50.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. Finally, if I would lend him $500 a year for two years, (this was 4 or
      5 years ago,) he knew he could make a success as a lawyer, and would prove
      it. This is the pension which we have just increased to $600. The first
      year his legal business brought him $5. It also brought him an
      unremunerative case where some villains were trying to chouse some negro
      orphans out of $700. He still has this case. He has waggled it around
      through various courts and made some booming speeches on it. The negro
      children have grown up and married off, now, I believe, and their
      litigated town-lot has been dug up and carted off by somebody&mdash;but
      Orion still infests the courts with his documents and makes the welkin
      ring with his venerable case. The second year, he didn&rsquo;t make
      anything. The third he made $6, and I made Bliss put a case in his hands&mdash;about
      half an hour&rsquo;s work. Orion charged $50 for it&mdash;Bliss paid him
      $15. Thus four or five years of slaving has brought him $26, but this will
      doubtless be increased when he gets done lecturing and buys that &ldquo;law
      library.&rdquo; Meantime his office rent has been $60 a year, and he has
      stuck to that lair day by day as patiently as a spider.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. Then he by and by conceived the idea of lecturing around America as
      &ldquo;Mark Twain&rsquo;s Brother&rdquo;&mdash;that to be on the bills.
      Subject of proposed lecture, &ldquo;On the Formation of Character.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      9. I protested, and he got on his warpaint, couched his lance, and ran a
      bold tilt against total abstinence and the Red Ribbon fanatics. It raised
      a fine row among the virtuous Keokukians.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. I wrote to encourage him in his good work, but I had let a mail
      intervene; so by the time my letter reached him he was already winning
      laurels as a Red Ribbon Howler.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. Afterward he took a rabid part in a prayer-meeting epidemic; dropped
      that to travesty Jules Verne; dropped that, in the middle of the last
      chapter, last March, to digest the matter of an infidel book which he
      proposed to write; and now he comes to the surface to rescue our &ldquo;noble
      and beautiful religion&rdquo; from the sacrilegious talons of Bob
      Ingersoll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now come! Don&rsquo;t fool away this treasure which Providence has laid at
      your feet, but take it up and use it. One can let his imagination run riot
      in portraying Orion, for there is nothing so extravagant as to be out of
      character with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well-good-bye, and a short life and a merry one be yours. Poor old
      Methusaleh, how did he manage to stand it so long?

    <p>
      MY DEAR BRO.,&mdash;Yours has just arrived. I enclose a draft on Hartford
      for $25. You will have abandoned the project you wanted it for, by the
      time it arrives,&mdash;but no matter, apply it to your newer and present
      project, whatever it is. You see I have an ineradicable faith in your
      unsteadfastness,&mdash;but mind you, I didn&rsquo;t invent that faith, you
      conferred it on me yourself. But fire away, fire away! I don&rsquo;t see
      why a changeable man shouldn&rsquo;t get as much enjoyment out of his
      changes, and transformations and transfigurations as a steadfast man gets
      out of standing still and pegging at the same old monotonous thing all the
      time. That is to say, I don&rsquo;t see why a kaleidoscope shouldn&rsquo;t
      enjoy itself as much as a telescope, nor a grindstone have as good a time
      as a whetstone, nor a barometer as good a time as a yardstick. I don&rsquo;t
      feel like girding at you any more about fickleness of purpose, because I
      recognize and realize at last that it is incurable; but before I learned
      to accept this truth, each new weekly project of yours possessed the power
      of throwing me into the most exhausting and helpless convulsions of
      profanity. But fire away, now! Your magic has lost its might. I am able to
      view your inspirations dispassionately and judicially, now, and say
      &ldquo;This one or that one or the other one is not up to your average
      flight, or is above it, or below it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, without passion, or prejudice, or bias of any kind, I sit in
      judgment upon your lecture project, and say it was up to your average, it
      was indeed above it, for it had possibilities in it, and even practical
      ones. While I was not sorry you abandoned it, I should not be sorry if you
      had stuck to it and given it a trial. But on the whole you did the wise
      thing to lay it aside, I think, because a lecture is a most easy thing to
      fail in; and at your time of life, and in your own town, such a failure
      would make a deep and cruel wound in your heart and in your pride. It was
      decidedly unwise in you to think for a moment of coming before a community
      who knew you, with such a course of lectures; because Keokuk is not
      unaware that you have been a Swedenborgian, a Presbyterian, a
      Congregationalist, and a Methodist (on probation), and that just a year
      ago you were an infidel. If Keokuk had gone to your lecture course, it
      would have gone to be amused, not instructed, for when a man is known to
      have no settled convictions of his own he can&rsquo;t convince other
      people. They would have gone to be amused and that would have been a deep
      humiliation to you. It could have been safe for you to appear only where
      you were unknown&mdash;then many of your hearers would think you were in
      earnest. And they would be right. You are in earnest while your
      convictions are new. But taking it by and large, you probably did best to
      discard that project altogether. But I leave you to judge of that, for you
      are the worst judge I know of.

     That Mark Twain in many ways was hardly less child-like than his
     brother is now and again revealed in his letters.  He was of
     steadfast purpose, and he possessed the driving power which Orion

      DEAR OLD JOE,&mdash;It was a mighty good letter, Joe&mdash;and that idea
      of yours is a rattling good one. But I have not sot down here to answer
      your letter,&mdash;for it is down at my study,&mdash;but only to impart
      some information.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a months I had not shaved without crying. I&rsquo;d spend 3/4 of an
      hour whetting away on my hand&mdash;no use, couldn&rsquo;t get an edge.
      Tried a razor strop-same result. So I sat down and put in an hour thinking
      out the mystery. Then it seemed plain&mdash;to wit: my hand can&rsquo;t
      give a razor an edge, it can only smooth and refine an edge that has
      already been given. I judge that a razor fresh from the hone is this shape
      V&mdash;the long point being the continuation of the edge&mdash;and that
      after much use the shape is this V&mdash;the attenuated edge all worn off
      and gone. By George I knew that was the explanation. And I knew that a
      freshly honed and freshly strapped razor won&rsquo;t cut, but after
      strapping on the hand as a final operation, it will cut.&mdash;So I sent
      out for an oil-stone; none to be had, but messenger brought back a little
      piece of rock the size of a Safety-match box&mdash;(it was bought in a
      shoemaker&rsquo;s shop) bad flaw in middle of it, too, but I put 4 drops
      of fine Olive oil on it, picked out the razor marked &ldquo;Thursday&rdquo;
      because it was never any account and would be no loss if I spoiled it&mdash;gave
      it a brisk and reckless honing for 10 minutes, then tried it on a hair&mdash;it
      wouldn&rsquo;t cut. Then I trotted it through a vigorous 20-minute course
      on a razor-strap and tried it on a hair-it wouldn&rsquo;t cut&mdash;tried
      it on my face&mdash;it made me cry&mdash;gave it a 5-minute stropping on
      my hand, and my land, what an edge she had! We thought we knew what sharp
      razors were when we were tramping in Switzerland, but it was a mistake&mdash;they
      were dull beside this old Thursday razor of mine&mdash;which I mean to
      name Thursday October Christian, in gratitude. I took my whetstone, and in
      20 minutes I put two more of my razors in splendid condition&mdash;but I
      leave them in the box&mdash;I never use any but Thursday O. C., and shan&rsquo;t
      till its edge is gone&mdash;and then I&rsquo;ll know how to restore it
      without any delay.

     In Paris they found pleasant quarters at the Hotel Normandy, but it
     was a chilly, rainy spring, and the travelers gained a rather poor
     impression of the French capital.  Mark Twain&rsquo;s work did not go
     well, at first, because of the noises of the street.  But then he
     found a quieter corner in the hotel and made better progress.  In a
     brief note to Aldrich he said: &ldquo;I sleep like a lamb and write like a
     lion&mdash;I mean the kind of a lion that writes&mdash;if any such.&rdquo;  He
     expected to finish the book in six weeks; that is to say, before
     returning to America.  He was looking after its illustrations
     himself, and a letter to Frank Bliss, of The American Publishing
     Company, refers to the frontpiece, which, from time to time, has
     caused question as to its origin.  To Bliss he says: &ldquo;It is a thing
     which I manufactured by pasting a popular comic picture into the
     middle of a celebrated Biblical one&mdash;shall attribute it to Titian.
     It needs to be engraved by a master.&rdquo;

     The weather continued bad in France and they left there in July to
     find it little better in England.  They had planned a journey to
     Scotland to visit Doctor Brown, whose health was not very good.  In
     after years Mark Twain blamed himself harshly for not making the
     trip, which he declared would have meant so much to Mrs. Clemens.
     He had forgotten by that time the real reasons for not going&mdash;the
     continued storms and uncertainty of trains (which made it barely
     possible for them to reach Liverpool in time for their
     sailing-date), and with characteristic self-reproach vowed that
     only perversity and obstinacy on his part had prevented the journey
     to Scotland.  From Liverpool, on the eve of sailing, he sent Doctor
     Brown a good-by word.

      MY DEAR MR. BROWN,&mdash;During all the 15 months we have been spending on
      the continent, we have been promising ourselves a sight of you as our
      latest and most prized delight in a foreign land&mdash;but our hope has
      failed, our plan has miscarried. One obstruction after another intruded
      itself, and our short sojourn of three or four weeks on English soil was
      thus frittered gradually away, and we were at last obliged to give up the
      idea of seeing you at all. It is a great disappointment, for we wanted to
      show you how much &ldquo;Megalopis&rdquo; has grown (she is 7 now) and
      what a fine creature her sister is, and how prettily they both speak
      German. There are six persons in my party, and they are as difficult to
      cart around as nearly any other menagerie would be. My wife and Miss
      Spaulding are along, and you may imagine how they take to heart this
      failure of our long promised Edinburgh trip. We never even wrote you,
      because we were always so sure, from day to day, that our affairs would
      finally so shape themselves as to let us get to Scotland. But no,&mdash;everything
      went wrong we had only flying trips here and there in place of the
      leisurely ones which we had planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      We arrived in Liverpool an hour ago very tired, and have halted at this
      hotel (by the advice of misguided friends)&mdash;and if my instinct and
      experience are worth anything, it is the very worst hotel on earth,
      without any exception. We shall move to another hotel early in the morning
      to spend to-morrow. We sail for America next day in the &ldquo;Gallic.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We all join in the sincerest love to you, and in the kindest remembrance
      to &ldquo;Jock&rdquo;&mdash;[Son of Doctor Brown.]&mdash;and your sister.

     It was September 3, 1879, that Mark Twain returned to America by the
     steamer Gallic.  In the seventeen months of his absence he had taken
     on a &ldquo;traveled look&rdquo; and had added gray hairs.  A New York paper
     said of his arrival that he looked older than when he went to
     Germany, and that his hair had turned quite gray.

     Mark Twain had not finished his book of travel in Paris&mdash;in fact,
     it seemed to him far from complete&mdash;and he settled down rather
     grimly to work on it at Quarry Farm.  When, after a few days no word
     of greeting came from Howells, Clemens wrote to ask if he were dead
     or only sleeping.  Howells hastily sent a line to say that he had
     been sleeping &ldquo;The sleep of a torpid conscience.  I will feign that
     I did not know where to write you; but I love you and all of yours,
     and I am tremendously glad that you are home again.  When and where
     shall we meet?  Have you come home with your pockets full of
     Atlantic papers?&rdquo;  Clemens, toiling away at his book, was, as usual,
     not without the prospect of other plans.  Orion, as literary
     material, never failed to excite him.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;When and where? Here on the farm would be an
      elegant place to meet, but of course you cannot come so far. So we will
      say Hartford or Belmont, about the beginning of November. The date of our
      return to Hartford is uncertain, but will be three or four weeks hence, I
      judge. I hope to finish my book here before migrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think maybe I&rsquo;ve got some Atlantic stuff in my head, but there&rsquo;s
      none in MS, I believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say&mdash;a friend of mine wants to write a play with me, I to furnish the
      broad-comedy cuss. I don&rsquo;t know anything about his ability, but his
      letter serves to remind me of our old projects. If you haven&rsquo;t used
      Orion or Old Wakeman, don&rsquo;t you think you and I can get together and
      grind out a play with one of those fellows in it? Orion is a field which
      grows richer and richer the more he mulches it with each new top-dressing
      of religion or other guano. Drop me an immediate line about this, won&rsquo;t
      you? I imagine I see Orion on the stage, always gentle, always melancholy,
      always changing his politics and religion, and trying to reform the world,
      always inventing something, and losing a limb by a new kind of explosion
      at the end of each of the four acts. Poor old chap, he is good material. I
      can imagine his wife or his sweetheart reluctantly adopting each of his
      new religious in turn, just in time to see him waltz into the next one and
      leave her isolated once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Mem. Orion&rsquo;s wife has followed him into the outer darkness, after
      30 years&rsquo; rabid membership in the Presbyterian Church.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, with the sincerest and most abounding love to you and yours, from
      all this family, I am,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                         Yrs ever
                                   MARK.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The idea of the play interested Howells, but he had twinges of
     conscience in the matter of using Orion as material.  He wrote:
     &ldquo;More than once I have taken the skeleton of that comedy of ours and
     viewed it with tears..... I really have a compunction or two about
     helping to put your brother into drama.  You can say that he is your
     brother, to do what you like with him, but the alien hand might
     inflict an incurable hurt on his tender heart.&rdquo;

     As a matter of fact, Orion Clemens had a keen appreciation of his
     own shortcomings, and would have enjoyed himself in a play as much
     as any observer of it.  Indeed, it is more than likely that he would
     have been pleased at the thought of such distinguished
     dramatization.  From the next letter one might almost conclude that
     he had received a hint of this plan, and was bent upon supplying
     rich material.

      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Since my return, the mail facilities have enabled
      Orion to keep me informed as to his intentions. Twenty-eight days ago it
      was his purpose to complete a work aimed at religion, the preface to which
      he had already written. Afterward he began to sell off his furniture, with
      the idea of hurrying to Leadville and tackling silver-mining&mdash;threw
      up his law den and took in his sign. Then he wrote to Chicago and St.
      Louis newspapers asking for a situation as &ldquo;paragrapher&rdquo;&mdash;enclosing
      a taste of his quality in the shape of two stanzas of &ldquo;humorous
      rhymes.&rdquo; By a later mail on the same day he applied to New York and
      Hartford insurance companies for copying to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it would take too long to detail all his projects. They comprise
      a removal to south-west Missouri; application for a reporter&rsquo;s berth
      on a Keokuk paper; application for a compositor&rsquo;s berth on a St.
      Louis paper; a re-hanging of his attorney&rsquo;s sign, &ldquo;though it
      only creaks and catches no flies;&rdquo; but last night&rsquo;s letter
      informs me that he has retackled the religious question, hired a distant
      den to write in, applied to my mother for $50 to re-buy his furniture,
      which has advanced in value since the sale&mdash;purposes buying $25 worth
      of books necessary to his labors which he had previously been borrowing,
      and his first chapter is already on its way to me for my decision as to
      whether it has enough ungodliness in it or not. Poor Orion!
    </p>
    <p>
      Your letter struck me while I was meditating a project to beguile you, and
      John Hay and Joe Twichell, into a descent upon Chicago which I dream of
      making, to witness the re-union of the great Commanders of the Western
      Army Corps on the 9th of next month. My sluggish soul needs a fierce
      upstirring, and if it would not get it when Grant enters the meeting place
      I must doubtless &ldquo;lay&rdquo; for the final resurrection. Can you and
      Hay go? At the same time, confound it, I doubt if I can go myself, for
      this book isn&rsquo;t done yet. But I would give a heap to be there. I
      mean to heave some holiness into the Hartford primaries when I go back;
      and if there was a solitary office in the land which majestic ignorance
      and incapacity, coupled with purity of heart, could fill, I would run for
      it. This naturally reminds me of Bret Harte&mdash;but let him pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      We propose to leave here for New York Oct. 21, reaching Hartford 24th or
      25th. If, upon reflection, you Howellses find, you can stop over here on
      your way, I wish you would do it, and telegraph me. Getting pretty hungry
      to see you. I had an idea that this was your shortest way home, but like
      as not my geography is crippled again&mdash;it usually is.

     The &ldquo;Reunion of the Great Commanders,&rdquo; mentioned in the foregoing,
     was a welcome to General Grant after his journey around the world.
     Grant&rsquo;s trip had been one continuous ovation&mdash;a triumphal march.
     In &lsquo;79 most of his old commanders were still alive, and they had
     planned to assemble in Chicago to do him honor.  A Presidential year
     was coming on, but if there was anything political in the project
     there were no surface indications.  Mark Twain, once a Confederate
     soldier, had long since been completely &ldquo;desouthernized&rdquo;&mdash;at least
     to the point where he felt that the sight of old comrades paying
     tribute to the Union commander would stir his blood as perhaps it
     had not been stirred, even in that earlier time, when that same
     commander had chased him through the Missouri swamps.  Grant,
     indeed, had long since become a hero to Mark Twain, though it is
     highly unlikely that Clemens favored the idea of a third term.  Some
     days following the preceding letter an invitation came for him to be
     present at the Chicago reunion; but by this time he had decided not
     to go.  The letter he wrote has been preserved.

</pre>
    <p>
      GEN. WM. E. STRONG, CH&rsquo;M, AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE:
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been hoping during several weeks that it might be my good fortune
      to receive an invitation to be present on that great occasion in Chicago;
      but now that my desire is accomplished my business matters have so shaped
      themselves as to bar me from being so far from home in the first half of
      November. It is with supreme regret that I lost this chance, for I have
      not had a thorough stirring up for some years, and I judged that if I
      could be in the banqueting hall and see and hear the veterans of the Army
      of the Tennessee at the moment that their old commander entered the room,
      or rose in his place to speak, my system would get the kind of upheaval it
      needs. General Grant&rsquo;s progress across the continent is of the
      marvelous nature of the returning Napoleon&rsquo;s progress from Grenoble
      to Paris; and as the crowning spectacle in the one case was the meeting
      with the Old Guard, so, likewise, the crowning spectacle in the other will
      be our great captain&rsquo;s meeting with his Old Guard&mdash;and that is
      the very climax which I wanted to witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, I wanted to see the General again, any way, and renew the
      acquaintance. He would remember me, because I was the person who did not
      ask him for an office. However, I consume your time, and also wander from
      the point&mdash;which is, to thank you for the courtesy of your
      invitation, and yield up my seat at the table to some other guest who may
      possibly grace it better, but will certainly not appreciate its privileges
      more, than I should.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              With great respect,

                                   I am, Gentlemen,

                              Very truly yours,

                                        S. L. CLEMENS.
</pre>
    <p>
      Private:&mdash;I beg to apologize for my delay, gentlemen, but the card of
      invitation went to Elmira, N. Y. and hence has only just now reached me.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     This letter was not sent.  He reconsidered and sent an acceptance,
     agreeing to speak, as the committee had requested.  Certainly there
     was something picturesque in the idea of the Missouri private who
     had been chased for a rainy fortnight through the swamps of Ralls
     County being selected now to join in welcome to his ancient enemy.

     The great reunion was to be something more than a mere banquet.  It
     would continue for several days, with processions, great
     assemblages, and much oratory.

     Mark Twain arrived in Chicago in good season to see it all.  Three
     letters to Mrs. Clemens intimately present his experiences: his
     enthusiastic enjoyment and his own personal triumph.

     The first was probably written after the morning of his arrival.
     The Doctor Jackson in it was Dr. A. Reeves Jackson, the
     guide-dismaying &ldquo;Doctor&rdquo; of Innocents Abroad.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                   PALMER HOUSE, CHICAGO, Nov. 11.
</pre>
    <p>
      Livy darling, I am getting a trifle leg-weary. Dr. Jackson called and
      dragged me out of bed at noon, yesterday, and then went off. I went down
      stairs and was introduced to some scores of people, and among them an
      elderly German gentleman named Raster, who said his wife owed her life to
      me&mdash;hurt in Chicago fire and lay menaced with death a long time, but
      the Innocents Abroad kept her mind in a cheerful attitude, and so, with
      the doctor&rsquo;s help for the body she pulled through.... They drove me
      to Dr. Jackson&rsquo;s and I had an hour&rsquo;s visit with Mrs. Jackson.
      Started to walk down Michigan Avenue, got a few steps on my way and met an
      erect, soldierly looking young gentleman who offered his hand; said,
      &ldquo;Mr. Clemens, I believe&mdash;I wish to introduce myself&mdash;you
      were pointed out to me yesterday as I was driving down street&mdash;my
      name is Grant.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Col. Fred Grant?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. My house is not ten steps away, and I would like you to come
      and have a talk and a pipe, and let me introduce my wife.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So we turned back and entered the house next to Jackson&rsquo;s and talked
      something more than an hour and smoked many pipes and had a sociable good
      time. His wife is very gentle and intelligent and pretty, and they have a
      cunning little girl nearly as big as Bay but only three years old. They
      wanted me to come in and spend an evening, after the banquet, with them
      and Gen. Grant, after this grand pow-wow is over, but I said I was going
      home Friday. Then they asked me to come Friday afternoon, when they and
      the general will receive a few friends, and I said I would. Col. Grant
      said he and Gen. Sherman used the Innocents Abroad as their guide book
      when they were on their travels.
    </p>
    <p>
      I stepped in next door and took Dr. Jackson to the hotel and we played
      billiards from 7 to 11.30 P.M. and then went to a beer-mill to meet some
      twenty Chicago journalists&mdash;talked, sang songs and made speeches till
      6 o&rsquo;clock this morning. Nobody got in the least degree &ldquo;under
      the influence,&rdquo; and we had a pleasant time. Read awhile in bed,
      slept till 11, shaved, went to breakfast at noon, and by mistake got into
      the servants&rsquo; hall. I remained there and breakfasted with twenty or
      thirty male and female servants, though I had a table to myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A temporary structure, clothed and canopied with flags, has been erected
      at the hotel front, and connected with the second-story windows of a
      drawing-room. It was for Gen. Grant to stand on and review the procession.
      Sixteen persons, besides reporters, had tickets for this place, and a
      seventeenth was issued for me. I was there, looking down on the packed and
      struggling crowd when Gen. Grant came forward and was saluted by the
      cheers of the multitude and the waving of ladies&rsquo; handkerchiefs&mdash;for
      the windows and roofs of all neighboring buildings were massed full of
      life. Gen. Grant bowed to the people two or three times, then approached
      my side of the platform and the mayor pulled me forward and introduced me.
      It was dreadfully conspicuous. The General said a word or so&mdash;I
      replied, and then said, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll step back, General, I don&rsquo;t
      want to interrupt your speech.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to make any&mdash;stay where you are&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      get you to make it for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      General Sherman came on the platform wearing the uniform of a full
      General, and you should have heard the cheers. Gen. Logan was going to
      introduce me, but I didn&rsquo;t want any more conspicuousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the head of the procession passed it was grand to see Sheridan, in
      his military cloak and his plumed chapeau, sitting as erect and rigid as a
      statue on his immense black horse&mdash;by far the most martial figure I
      ever saw. And the crowd roared again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was chilly, and Gen. Deems lent me his overcoat until night. He came a
      few minutes ago&mdash;5.45 P.M., and got it, but brought Gen. Willard, who
      lent me his for the rest of my stay, and will get another for himself when
      he goes home to dinner. Mine is much too heavy for this warm weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a seat on the stage at Haverley&rsquo;s Theatre, tonight, where the
      Army of the Tennessee will receive Gen. Grant, and where Gen. Sherman will
      make a speech. At midnight I am to attend a meeting of the Owl Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love you ever so much, my darling, and am hoping to get a word from you
      yet.

</pre>
    <p>
      Livy darling, it was a great time. There were perhaps thirty people on the
      stage of the theatre, and I think I never sat elbow-to-elbow with so many
      historic names before. Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Schofield, Pope, Logan,
      Augur, and so on. What an iron man Grant is! He sat facing the house, with
      his right leg crossed over his left and his right boot-sole tilted up at
      an angle, and his left hand and arm reposing on the arm of his chair&mdash;you
      note that position? Well, when glowing references were made to other
      grandees on the stage, those grandees always showed a trifle of nervous
      consciousness&mdash;and as these references came frequently, the nervous
      change of position and attitude were also frequent. But Grant!&mdash;he
      was under a tremendous and ceaseless bombardment of praise and
      gratulation, but as true as I&rsquo;m sitting here he never moved a muscle
      of his body for a single instant, during 30 minutes! You could have played
      him on a stranger for an effigy. Perhaps he never would have moved, but at
      last a speaker made such a particularly ripping and blood-stirring remark
      about him that the audience rose and roared and yelled and stamped and
      clapped an entire minute&mdash;Grant sitting as serene as ever&mdash;when
      Gen. Sherman stepped to him, laid his hand affectionately on his shoulder,
      bent respectfully down and whispered in his ear. Gen. Grant got up and
      bowed, and the storm of applause swelled into a hurricane. He sat down,
      took about the same position and froze to it till by and by there was
      another of those deafening and protracted roars, when Sherman made him get
      up and bow again. He broke up his attitude once more&mdash;the extent of
      something more than a hair&rsquo;s breadth&mdash;to indicate me to Sherman
      when the house was keeping up a determined and persistent call for me, and
      poor bewildered Sherman, (who did not know me), was peering abroad over
      the packed audience for me, not knowing I was only three feet from him and
      most conspicuously located, (Gen. Sherman was Chairman.)
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most illustrious individuals on that stage was &ldquo;Ole Abe,&rdquo;
      the historic war eagle. He stood on his perch&mdash;the old savage-eyed
      rascal&mdash;three or four feet behind Gen. Sherman, and as he had been in
      nearly every battle that was mentioned by the orators his soul was
      probably stirred pretty often, though he was too proud to let on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read Logan&rsquo;s bosh, and try to imagine a burly and magnificent
      Indian, in General&rsquo;s uniform, striking a heroic attitude and getting
      that stuff off in the style of a declaiming school-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please put the enclosed scraps in the drawer and I will scrap-book them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I only staid at the Owl Club till 3 this morning and drank little or
      nothing. Went to sleep without whisky. Ich liebe dish.

     But it is in the third letter that we get the climax.  On the same
     day he wrote a letter to Howells, which, in part, is very similar in
     substance and need not be included here.

     A paragraph, however, must not be omitted.

     &ldquo;Imagine what it was like to see a bullet-shredded old battle-flag
     reverently unfolded to the gaze of a thousand middle-aged soldiers,
     most of whom hadn&rsquo;t seen it since they saw it advancing over
     victorious fields, when they were in their prime.  And imagine what
     it was like when Grant, their first commander, stepped into view
     while they were still going mad over the flag, and then right in the
     midst of it all somebody struck up, &lsquo;When we were marching through
     Georgia.&rsquo;  Well, you should have heard the thousand voices lift that
     chorus and seen the tears stream down.  If I live a hundred years I
     shan&rsquo;t ever forget these things, nor be able to talk about them....
     Grand times, my boy, grand times!&rdquo;

     At the great banquet Mark Twain&rsquo;s speech had been put last on the
     program, to hold the house.  He had been invited to respond to the
     toast of &ldquo;The Ladies,&rdquo; but had replied that he had already responded
     to that toast more than once.  There was one class of the community,
     he said, commonly overlooked on these occasions&mdash;the babies&mdash;he
     would respond to that toast.  In his letter to Howells he had not
     been willing to speak freely of his personal triumph, but to Mrs.
     Clemens he must tell it all, and with that child-like ingenuousness
     which never failed him to his last day.

    <p>
      A little after 5 in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ve just come to my room, Livy darling, I guess this was the
      memorable night of my life. By George, I never was so stirred since I was
      born. I heard four speeches which I can never forget. One by Emory Storrs,
      one by Gen. Vilas (O, wasn&rsquo;t it wonderful!) one by Gen. Logan
      (mighty stirring), one by somebody whose name escapes me, and one by that
      splendid old soul, Col. Bob Ingersoll,&mdash;oh, it was just the supremest
      combination of English words that was ever put together since the world
      began. My soul, how handsome he looked, as he stood on that table, in the
      midst of those 500 shouting men, and poured the molten silver from his
      lips! Lord, what an organ is human speech when it is played by a master!
      All these speeches may look dull in print, but how the lightning glared
      around them when they were uttered, and how the crowd roared in response!
      It was a great night, a memorable night. I am so richly repaid for my
      journey&mdash;and how I did wish with all my whole heart that you were
      there to be lifted into the very seventh heaven of enthusiasm, as I was.
      The army songs, the military music, the crashing applause&mdash;Lord bless
      me, it was unspeakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of compliment they placed me last in the list&mdash;No. 15&mdash;I was
      to &ldquo;hold the crowd&rdquo;&mdash;and bless my life I was in awful
      terror when No. 14. rose, at a o&rsquo;clock this morning and killed all
      the enthusiasm by delivering the flattest, insipidest, silliest of all
      responses to &ldquo;Woman&rdquo; that ever a weary multitude listened to.
      Then Gen. Sherman (Chairman) announced my toast, and the crowd gave me a
      good round of applause as I mounted on top of the dinner table, but it was
      only on account of my name, nothing more&mdash;they were all tired and
      wretched. They let my first sentence go in silence, till I paused and
      added &ldquo;we stand on common ground&rdquo;&mdash;then they burst forth
      like a hurricane and I saw that I had them! From that time on, I stopped
      at the end of each sentence, and let the tornado of applause and laughter
      sweep around me&mdash;and when I closed with &ldquo;And if the child is
      but the prophecy of the man, there are mighty few who will doubt that he
      succeeded,&rdquo; I say it who oughtn&rsquo;t to say it, the house came
      down with a crash. For two hours and a half, now, I&rsquo;ve been shaking
      hands and listening to congratulations. Gen. Sherman said, &ldquo;Lord
      bless you, my boy, I don&rsquo;t know how you do it&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
      secret that&rsquo;s beyond me&mdash;but it was great&mdash;give me your
      hand again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And do you know, Gen. Grant sat through fourteen speeches like a graven
      image, but I fetched him! I broke him up, utterly! He told me he laughed
      till the tears came and every bone in his body ached. (And do you know,
      the biggest part of the success of the speech lay in the fact that the
      audience saw that for once in his life he had been knocked out of his iron
      serenity.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Bless your soul, &lsquo;twas immense. I never was so proud in my life.
      Lots and lots of people&mdash;hundreds I might say&mdash;told me my speech
      was the triumph of the evening&mdash;which was a lie. Ladies, Tom, Dick
      and Harry&mdash;even the policemen&mdash;captured me in the halls and
      shook hands, and scores of army officers said &ldquo;We shall always be
      grateful to you for coming.&rdquo; General Pope came to bunt me up&mdash;I
      was afraid to speak to him on that theatre stage last night, thinking it
      might be presumptuous to tackle a man so high up in military history. Gen.
      Schofield, and other historic men, paid their compliments. Sheridan was
      ill and could not come, but I&rsquo;m to go with a General of his staff
      and see him before I go to Col. Grant&rsquo;s. Gen. Augur&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve
      talked with them all, received invitations from them all&mdash;from people
      living everywhere&mdash;and as I said before, it&rsquo;s a memorable
      night. I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed it for anything in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But my sakes, you should have heard Ingersoll&rsquo;s speech on that
      table! Half an hour ago he ran across me in the crowded halls and put his
      arms about me and said &ldquo;Mark, if I live a hundred years, I&rsquo;ll
      always be grateful for your speech&mdash;Lord what a supreme thing it was.&rdquo;
      But I told him it wasn&rsquo;t any use to talk, he had walked off with the
      honors of that occasion by something of a majority. Bully boy is Ingersoll&mdash;traveled
      with him in the cars the other day, and you can make up your mind we had a
      good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I forgot to go and pay for my hotel car and so secure it, but
      the army officers told me an hour ago to rest easy, they would go at once,
      at this unholy hour of the night and compel the railways to do their duty
      by me, and said &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to request the Army of the
      Tennessee to do your desires&mdash;you can command its services.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I bummed around that banquet hall from 8 in the evening till 2 in
      the morning, talking with people and listening to speeches, and I never
      ate a single bite or took a sup of anything but ice water, so if I seem
      excited now, it is the intoxication of supreme enthusiasm. By George, it
      was a grand night, a historical night.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now it is a quarter past 6 A.M.&mdash;so good bye and God bless you

      Mark Twain&rsquo;s admiration for Robert Ingersoll was very great, and we
      may believe that he was deeply impressed by the Chicago speech, when we
      find him, a few days later, writing to Ingersoll for a perfect copy to
      read to a young girls&rsquo; club in Hartford. Ingersoll sent the speech,
      also some of his books, and the next letter is Mark Twain&rsquo;s
      acknowledgment.

      MY DEAR INGERSOLL,&mdash;Thank you most heartily for the books&mdash;I am
      devouring them&mdash;they have found a hungry place, and they content it
      and satisfy it to a miracle. I wish I could hear you speak these splendid

      The Chicago speech arrived an hour too late, but I was all right anyway,
      for I found that my memory had been able to correct all the errors. I read

     The reader may remember Mark Twain&rsquo;s Whittier dinner speech of 1877,
     and its disastrous effects.  Now, in 1879, there was to be another
     Atlantic gathering: a breakfast to Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, to
     which Clemens was invited.  He was not eager to accept; it would
     naturally recall memories of two years before, but being urged by
     both Howells and Warner, he agreed to attend if they would permit
     him to speak.  Mark Twain never lacked courage and he wanted to
     redeem himself.  To Howells he wrote:

      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;If anybody talks, there, I shall claim the right to

     The matter turned out well.  Clemens, once more introduced by
     Howells&mdash;this time conservatively, it may be said&mdash;delivered a
     delicate and fitting tribute to Doctor Holmes, full of graceful
     humor and grateful acknowledgment, the kind of speech he should have

     The book of travel,&mdash;[A Tramp Abroad.]&mdash;which Mark Twain had

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Am waiting for Patrick to come with the carriage.
      Mrs. Clemens and I are starting (without the children) to stay
      indefinitely in Elmira. The wear and tear of settling the house broke her
      down, and she has been growing weaker and weaker for a fortnight. All that
      time&mdash;in fact ever since I saw you&mdash;I have been fighting a
      life-and-death battle with this infernal book and hoping to get done some
      day. I required 300 pages of MS, and I have written near 600 since I saw
      you&mdash;and tore it all up except 288. This I was about to tear up
      yesterday and begin again, when Mrs. Perkins came up to the billiard room
      and said, &ldquo;You will never get any woman to do the thing necessary to
      save her life by mere persuasion; you see you have wasted your words for
      three weeks; it is time to use force; she must have a change; take her
      home and leave the children here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I said, &ldquo;If there is one death that is painfuller than another, may
      I get it if I don&rsquo;t do that thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I took the 288 pages to Bliss and told him that was the very last line
      I should ever write on this book. (A book which required 2600 pages of MS,
      and I have written nearer four thousand, first and last.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I am as soary (and flighty) as a rocket, to-day, with the unutterable joy
      of getting that Old Man of the Sea off my back, where he has been roosting
      for more than a year and a half. Next time I make a contract before
      writing the book, may I suffer the righteous penalty and be burnt, like
      the injudicious believer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am mighty glad you are done your book (this is from a man who, above all
      others, feels how much that sentence means) and am also mighty glad you
      have begun the next (this is also from a man who knows the felicity of
      that, and means straightway to enjoy it.) The Undiscovered starts off
      delightfully&mdash;I have read it aloud to Mrs. C. and we vastly enjoyed
      it.

     In a letter which Mark Twain wrote to his brother Orion at this
     period we get the first hint of a venture which was to play an
     increasingly important part in the Hartford home and fortunes during
     the next ten or a dozen years.  This was the type-setting machine
     investment, which, in the end, all but wrecked Mark Twain&rsquo;s
     finances.  There is but a brief mention of it in the letter to
     Orion, and the letter itself is not worth preserving, but as
     references to the &ldquo;machine&rdquo; appear with increasing frequency, it
     seems proper to record here its first mention.  In the same letter
     he suggests to his brother that he undertake an absolutely truthful
     autobiography, a confession in which nothing is to be withheld.  He
     cites the value of Casanova&rsquo;s memories, and the confessions of
     Rousseau.  Of course, any literary suggestion from &ldquo;Brother Sam&rdquo; was
     gospel to Orion, who began at once piling up manuscript at a great
     rate.

     Meantime, Mark Twain himself, having got &lsquo;A Tramp Abroad&rsquo; on the
     presses, was at work with enthusiasm on a story begun nearly three
     years before at Quarry Farm-a story for children-its name, as he
     called it then, &ldquo;The Little Prince and The Little Pauper.&rdquo;  He was
     presently writing to Howells his delight in the new work.

      To W. D. Howells, in Boston:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        HARTFORD, Mch. 11, &lsquo;80.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;... I take so much pleasure in my story that I am
      loth to hurry, not wanting to get it done. Did I ever tell you the plot of
      it? It begins at 9 a.m., Jan. 27, 1547, seventeen and a half hours before
      Henry VIII&rsquo;s death, by the swapping of clothes and place, between
      the prince of Wales and a pauper boy of the same age and countenance (and
      half as much learning and still more genius and imagination) and after
      that, the rightful small King has a rough time among tramps and ruffians
      in the country parts of Kent, whilst the small bogus King has a gilded and
      worshipped and dreary and restrained and cussed time of it on the throne&mdash;and
      this all goes on for three weeks&mdash;till the midst of the coronation
      grandeurs in Westminster Abbey, Feb. 20, when the ragged true King forces
      his way in but cannot prove his genuineness&mdash;until the bogus King, by
      a remembered incident of the first day is able to prove it for him&mdash;whereupon
      clothes are changed and the coronation proceeds under the new and rightful
      conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My idea is to afford a realizing sense of the exceeding severity of the
      laws of that day by inflicting some of their penalties upon the King
      himself and allowing him a chance to see the rest of them applied to
      others&mdash;all of which is to account for certain mildnesses which
      distinguished Edward VI&rsquo;s reign from those that preceded and
      followed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine this fact&mdash;I have even fascinated Mrs. Clemens with this yarn
      for youth. My stuff generally gets considerable damning with faint praise
      out of her, but this time it is all the other way. She is become the
      horseleech&rsquo;s daughter and my mill doesn&rsquo;t grind fast enough to
      suit her. This is no mean triumph, my dear sir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last night, for the first time in ages, we went to the theatre&mdash;to
      see Yorick&rsquo;s Love. The magnificence of it is beyond praise. The
      language is so beautiful, the passion so fine, the plot so ingenious, the
      whole thing so stirring, so charming, so pathetic! But I will clip from
      the Courant&mdash;it says it right.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what a good company it is, and how like live people they all acted!
      The &ldquo;thee&rsquo;s&rdquo; and the &ldquo;thou&rsquo;s&rdquo; had a
      pleasant sound, since it is the language of the Prince and the Pauper. You&rsquo;ve
      done the country a service in that admirable work....

     The play, &ldquo;Yorick&rsquo;s Love,&rdquo; mentioned in this letter, was one which
     Howells had done for Lawrence Barrett.

     Onion Clemens, meantime, was forwarding his manuscript, and for once
     seems to have won his brother&rsquo;s approval, so much so that Mark Twain
     was willing, indeed anxious, that Howells should run the
     &ldquo;autobiography&rdquo; in the Atlantic.  We may imagine how Onion prized
     the words of commendation which follow:

    <p>
      MY DEAR BROTHER,&mdash;It is a model autobiography.
    </p>
    <p>
      Continue to develop your character in the same gradual inconspicuous and
      apparently unconscious way. The reader, up to this time, may have his
      doubts, perhaps, but he can&rsquo;t say decidedly, &ldquo;This writer is
      not such a simpleton as he has been letting on to be.&rdquo; Keep him in
      that state of mind. If, when you shall have finished, the reader shall
      say, &ldquo;The man is an ass, but I really don&rsquo;t know whether he
      knows it or not,&rdquo; your work will be a triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stop re-writing. I saw places in your last batch where re-writing had done
      formidable injury. Do not try to find those places, else you will mar them
      further by trying to better them. It is perilous to revise a book while it
      is under way. All of us have injured our books in that foolish way.

    <p>
      Keep in mind what I told you&mdash;when you recollect something which
      belonged in an earlier chapter, do not go back, but jam it in where you
      are. Discursiveness does not hurt an autobiography in the least.

     But Howells could not bring himself to print so frank a confession
     as Orion had been willing to make.  &ldquo;It wrung my heart,&rdquo; he said,
     &ldquo;and I felt haggard after I had finished it.  The writer&rsquo;s soul is
     laid bare; it is shocking.&rdquo;  Howells added that the best touches in
     it were those which made one acquainted with the writer&rsquo;s brother;
     that is to say, Mark Twain, and that these would prove valuable
     material hereafter&mdash;a true prophecy, for Mark Twain&rsquo;s early
     biography would have lacked most of its vital incident, and at least
     half of its background, without those faithful chapters, fortunately
     preserved.  Had Onion continued, as he began, the work might have
     proved an important contribution to literature, but he went trailing
     off into by-paths of theology and discussion where the interest was
     lost.  There were, perhaps, as many as two thousand pages of it,
     which few could undertake to read.

     Mark Twain&rsquo;s mind was always busy with plans and inventions, many of
     them of serious intent, some semi-serious, others of a purely
     whimsical character.  Once he proposed a &ldquo;Modest Club,&rdquo; of which the
     first and main qualification for membership was modesty.  &ldquo;At
     present,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;I am the only member; and as the modesty
     required must be of a quite aggravated type, the enterprise did seem
     for a time doomed to stop dead still with myself, for lack of
     further material; but upon reflection I have come to the conclusion
     that you are eligible.  Therefore, I have held a meeting and voted
     to offer you the distinction of membership.  I do not know that we
     can find any others, though I have had some thought of Hay, Warner,
     Twichell, Aldrich, Osgood, Fields, Higginson, and a few more
     &mdash;together with Mrs. Howells, Mrs. Clemens, and certain others
     of the sex.&rdquo;

     Howells replied that the only reason he had for not joining the
     Modest Club was that he was too modest&mdash;too modest to confess his
     modesty.  &ldquo;If I could get over this difficulty I should like to
     join, for I approve highly of the Club and its object....  It ought
     to be given an annual dinner at the public expense.  If you think I
     am not too modest you may put my name down and I will try to think
     the same of you.  Mrs. Howells applauded the notion of the club from
     the very first.  She said that she knew one thing: that she was
     modest enough, anyway.  Her manner of saying it implied that the
     other persons you had named were not, and created a painful
     impression in my mind.  I have sent your letter and the rules to
     Hay, but I doubt his modesty.  He will think he has a right to
     belong to it as much as you or I; whereas, other people ought only
     to be admitted on sufferance.&rdquo;

     Our next letter to Howells is, in the main, pure foolery, but we get
     in it a hint what was to become in time one of Mask Twain&rsquo;s
     strongest interests, the matter of copyright.  He had both a
     personal and general interest in the subject.  His own books were
     constantly pirated in Canada, and the rights of foreign authors were
     not respected in America.  We have already seen how he had drawn a
     petition which Holmes, Lowell, Longfellow, and others were to sign,
     and while nothing had come of this plan he had never ceased to
     formulate others.  Yet he hesitated when he found that the proposed
     protection was likely to work a hardship to readers of the poorer
     class.  Once he wrote: &ldquo;My notions have mightily changed lately....
     I can buy a lot of the copyright classics, in paper, at from three
     to thirty cents apiece.  These things must find their way into the
     very kitchens and hovels of the country.....  And even if the treaty
     will kill Canadian piracy, and thus save me an average of $5,000 a
     year, I am down on it anyway, and I&rsquo;d like cussed well to write an
     article opposing the treaty.&rdquo;

      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;There you stick, at Belmont, and now I&rsquo;m

      Providence that visit is going to get mixed, and you&rsquo;ll have been

      library off the alarm, and spread everything open, so that there wasn&rsquo;t
      any obstruction between him and the cellar.&rdquo; Language wasn&rsquo;t
      capable of conveying this woman&rsquo;s disgust. But the sense of what she
      said, was, &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t have done any harm in the conservatory&mdash;so
      you must go and make the entire house free to him and the burglars,
      imagining that he will prefer the coal-bins to the drawing-room. If you
      had had Mr. Howells to help you, I should have admired but not been
      astonished, because I should know that together you would be equal to it;
      but how you managed to contrive such a stately blunder all by yourself, is
      what I cannot understand.&rdquo;

      Brisk times here.&mdash;Saturday, these things happened: Our neighbor
      Chas. Smith was stricken with heart disease, and came near joining the
      majority; my publisher, Bliss, ditto, ditto; a neighbor&rsquo;s child
      died; neighbor Whitmore&rsquo;s sixth child added to his five other cases
      of measles; neighbor Niles sent for, and responded; Susie Warner down,
      abed; Mrs. George Warner threatened with death during several hours; her
      son Frank, whilst imitating the marvels in Barnum&rsquo;s circus bills,
      thrown from his aged horse and brought home insensible: Warner&rsquo;s
      friend Max Yortzburgh, shot in the back by a locomotive and broken into 32
      distinct pieces and his life threatened; and Mrs. Clemens, after writing
      all these cheerful things to Clara Spaulding, taken at midnight, and if
      the doctor had not been pretty prompt the contemplated Clemens would have
      called before his apartments were ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, everybody is all right, now, except Yortzburg, and he is mending&mdash;that
      is, he is being mended. I knocked off, during these stirring times, and
      don&rsquo;t intend to go to work again till we go away for the Summer, 3
      or 6 weeks hence. So I am writing to you not because I have anything to
      say, but because you don&rsquo;t have to answer and I need something to do
      this afternoon.....

      I have a letter from a Congressman this morning, and he says Congress
      couldn&rsquo;t be persuaded to bother about Canadian pirates at a time
      like this when all legislation must have a political and Presidential
      bearing, else Congress won&rsquo;t look at it. So have changed my mind and
      my course; I go north, to kill a pirate. I must procure repose some way,
      else I cannot get down to work again.

     It was always dangerous to send strangers with letters of
     introduction to Mark Twain.  They were so apt to arrive at the wrong
     time, or to find him in the wrong mood.  Howells was willing to risk
     it, and that the result was only amusing instead of tragic is the
     best proof of their friendship.

      Well, old practical joker, the corpse of Mr. X&mdash;&mdash;has been here,

      tried my level best to make it do something, or say something, or
      appreciate something&mdash;but no, it was worse than Lazarus. A
      kind-hearted, well-meaning corpse was the Boston young man, but lawsy
      bless me, horribly dull company. Now, old man, unless you have great
      confidence in Mr. X&rsquo;s judgment, you ought to make him submit his
      article to you before he prints it. For only think how true I was to you:
      Every hour that he was here I was saying, gloatingly, &ldquo;O G&mdash; d&mdash;-
      you, when you are in bed and your light out, I will fix you&rdquo;

      It is curious to note the change in the stock-quotation of the Affection
      Board brought about by throwing this new security on the market. Four
      weeks ago the children still put Mamma at the head of the list right
      along, where she had always been. But now:

    <p>
      That is the way it stands, now Mamma is become No. 2; I have dropped from
      No. 4., and am become No. 5. Some time ago it used to be nip and tuck

      I&rsquo;ve got a swollen ear; so I take advantage of it to lie abed most

      is forming in your ear.&rdquo;

      Been reading Daniel Webster&rsquo;s Private Correspondence. Have read a

      bathostic) letters written in that dim (no, vanished) Past when he was a
      student; and Lord, to think that this boy who is so real to me now, and so
      booming with fresh young blood and bountiful life, and sappy cynicisms
      about girls, has since climbed the Alps of fame and stood against the sun
      one brief tremendous moment with the world&rsquo;s eyes upon him, and then&mdash;f-z-t-!
      where is he? Why the only long thing, the only real thing about the whole
      shadowy business is the sense of the lagging dull and hoary lapse of time
      that has drifted by since then; a vast empty level, it seems, with a
      formless spectre glimpsed fitfully through the smoke and mist that lie
      along its remote verge.

      Well, we are all getting along here first-rate; Livy gains strength daily,
      and sits up a deal; the baby is five weeks old and&mdash;but no more of
      this; somebody may be reading this letter 80 years hence. And so, my
      friend (you pitying snob, I mean, who are holding this yellow paper in
      your hand in 1960,) save yourself the trouble of looking further; I know
      how pathetically trivial our small concerns will seem to you, and I will
      not let your eye profane them. No, I keep my news; you keep your
      compassion. Suffice it you to know, scoffer and ribald, that the little

      MY DEAR ALDRICH,&mdash;Thank you ever so much for the book&mdash;I had
      already finished it, and prodigiously enjoyed it, in the periodical of the
      notorious Howells, but it hits Mrs. Clemens just right, for she is having
      a reading holiday, now, for the first time in same months; so
      between-times, when the new baby is asleep and strengthening up for

      I hope Howells is enjoying his journey to the Pacific. He wrote me that
      you and Osgood were going, also, but I doubted it, believing he was in
      liquor when he wrote it. In my opinion, this universal applause over his

      the papers say mighty fine things about your book, too. You ought to try

     While Mark Twain was a journalist in San Francisco, there was a
     middle-aged man named Soule, who had a desk near him on the Morning
     Call.  Soule was in those days highly considered as a poet by his
     associates, most of whom were younger and less gracefully poetic.
     But Soule&rsquo;s gift had never been an important one.  Now, in his old
     age, he found his fame still local, and he yearned for wider
     recognition.  He wished to have a volume of poems issued by a
     publisher of recognized standing.  Because Mark Twain had been one
     of Soule&rsquo;s admirers and a warm friend in the old days, it was
     natural that Soule should turn to him now, and equally natural that
     Clemens should turn to Howells.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        Sunday, Oct.  2 &lsquo;80.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Here&rsquo;s a letter which I wrote you to San
      Francisco the second time you didn&rsquo;t go there.... I told Soule he
      needn&rsquo;t write you, but simply send the MS. to you. O dear, dear, it
      is dreadful to be an unrecognized poet. How wise it was in Charles Warren
      Stoddard to take in his sign and go for some other calling while still
      young.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m laying for that Encyclopedical Scotchman&mdash;and he&rsquo;ll
      need to lock the door behind him, when he comes in; otherwise when he
      hears my proposed tariff his skin will probably crawl away with him. He is
      accustomed to seeing the publisher impoverish the author&mdash;that
      spectacle must be getting stale to him&mdash;if he contracts with the
      undersigned he will experience a change in that programme that will make
      the enamel peel off his teeth for very surprise&mdash;and joy. No, that
      last is what Mrs. Clemens thinks&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not so. The proposed
      work is growing, mightily, in my estimation, day by day; and I&rsquo;m not
      going to throw it away for any mere trifle. If I make a contract with the
      canny Scot, I will then tell him the plan which you and I have devised
      (that of taking in the humor of all countries)&mdash;otherwise I&rsquo;ll
      keep it to myself, I think. Why should we assist our fellowman for mere
      love of God?
    </p>

     One wishes that Howells might have found value enough in the verses
     of Frank Soule to recommend them to Osgood.  To Clemens he wrote:
     &ldquo;You have touched me in regard to him, and I will deal gently with
     his poetry.  Poor old fellow!  I can imagine him, and how he must
     have to struggle not to be hard or sour.&rdquo;

     The verdict, however, was inevitable.  Soule&rsquo;s graceful verses
     proved to be not poetry at all.  No publisher of standing could
     afford to give them his imprint.

     The &ldquo;Encyclopedical Scotchman&rdquo; mentioned in the preceding letter was
     the publisher Gebbie, who had a plan to engage Howells and Clemens
     to prepare some sort of anthology of the world&rsquo;s literature.  The
     idea came to nothing, though the other plan mentioned&mdash;for a library
     of humor&mdash;in time grew into a book.

     Mark Twain&rsquo;s contracts with Bliss for the publication of his books
     on the subscription plan had been made on a royalty basis, beginning
     with 5 per cent. on &lsquo;The Innocents Abroad&rsquo; increasing to 7 per
     cent. on &lsquo;Roughing It,&rsquo; and to 10 per cent. on later books.  Bliss
     had held that these later percentages fairly represented one half
     the profits.  Clemens, however, had never been fully satisfied, and
     his brother Onion had more than once urged him to demand a specific
     contract on the half-profit basis.  The agreement for the
     publication of &lsquo;A Tramp Abroad&rsquo; was made on these terms.  Bliss died
     before Clemens received his first statement of sales.  Whatever may
     have been the facts under earlier conditions, the statement proved
     to Mark Twain&rsquo;s satisfaction; at least, that the half-profit
     arrangement was to his advantage.  It produced another result; it
     gave Samuel Clemens an excuse to place his brother Onion in a
     position of independence.

    <p>
      MY DEAR BRO.,&mdash;Bliss is dead. The aspect of the balance-sheet is
      enlightening. It reveals the fact, through my present contract, (which is
      for half the profits on the book above actual cost of paper, printing and
      binding,) that I have lost considerably by all this nonsense&mdash;sixty
      thousand dollars, I should say&mdash;and if Bliss were alive I would stay
      with the concern and get it all back; for on each new book I would require
      a portion of that back pay; but as it is (this in the very strictest
      confidence,) I shall probably go to a new publisher 6 or 8 months hence,
      for I am afraid Frank, with his poor health, will lack push and drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the suspicions you bred in me years ago, has grown this result,&mdash;to
      wit, that I shall within the twelvemonth get $40,000 out of this &ldquo;Tramp&rdquo;
      instead Of $20,000. Twenty thousand dollars, after taxes and other
      expenses are stripped away, is worth to the investor about $75 a month&mdash;so
      I shall tell Mr. Perkins to make your check that amount per month,
      hereafter, while our income is able to afford it. This ends the loan
      business; and hereafter you can reflect that you are living not on
      borrowed money but on money which you have squarely earned, and which has
      no taint or savor of charity about it&mdash;and you can also reflect that
      the money you have been receiving of me all these years is interest
      charged against the heavy bill which the next publisher will have to stand
      who gets a book of mine.

     On the completion of The Prince and Pauper story, Clemens had
     naturally sent it to Howells for consideration.  Howells wrote:
     &ldquo;I have read the two P&rsquo;s and I like it immensely, it begins well and
     it ends well.&rdquo;  He pointed out some things that might be changed or
     omitted, and added: &ldquo;It is such a book as I would expect from you,
     knowing what a bottom of fury there is to your fun.&rdquo;  Clemens had
     thought somewhat of publishing the story anonymously, in the fear
     that it would not be accepted seriously over his own signature.

     The &ldquo;bull story&rdquo; referred to in the next letter is the one later
     used in the Joan of Arc book, the story told Joan by &ldquo;Uncle Laxart,&rdquo;

      been sitting up nights building facts and arguments together into a mighty
      and unassailable array and had studied them out and got them by heart&mdash;all
      with the trembling half-hearted hope of getting Grant to add his signature
      to a sort of petition to the Viceroy of China; but Grant took in the whole
      situation in a jiffy, and before Joe had more than fairly got started, the
      old man said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll write the Viceroy a Letter&mdash;a
      separate letter&mdash;and bring strong reasons to bear upon him; I know
      him well, and what I say will have weight with him; I will attend to it
      right away. No, no thanks&mdash;I shall be glad to do it&mdash;it will be
      a labor of love.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So all Joe&rsquo;s laborious hours were for naught! It was as if he had
      come to borrow a dollar, and been offered a thousand before he could
      unfold his case....
    </p>
    <p>
      But it&rsquo;s getting dark. Merry Christmas to all of you.

     The Chinese Educational Mission, mentioned in the foregoing, was a
     thriving Hartford institution, projected eight years before by a
     Yale graduate named Yung Wing.  The mission was now threatened, and
     Yung Wing, knowing the high honor in which General Grant was held in
     China, believed that through him it might be saved.  Twichell, of
     course, was deeply concerned and naturally overjoyed at Grant&rsquo;s
     interest.  A day or two following the return to Hartford, Clemens
     received a letter from General Grant, in which he wrote: &ldquo;Li Hung
     Chang is the most powerful and most influential Chinaman in his
     country.  He professed great friendship for me when I was there, and
     I have had assurances of the same thing since.  I hope, if he is
     strong enough with his government, that the decision to withdraw the
     Chinese students from this country may be changed.&rdquo;

     But perhaps Li Hung Chang was experiencing one of his partial
     eclipses just then, or possibly he was not interested, for the
     Hartford Mission did not survive.

     With all of Mark Twain&rsquo;s admiration for Grant, he had
     opposed him as a third-term President and approved of the
     nomination of Garfield.  He had made speeches for Garfield
     during the campaign just ended, and had been otherwise
     active in his support.  Upon Garfield&rsquo;s election, however,

    <p>
      GEN. GARFIELD
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR SIR,&mdash;Several times since your election persons wanting office
      have asked me &ldquo;to use my influence&rdquo; with you in their behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      To word it in that way was such a pleasant compliment to me that I never
      complied. I could not without exposing the fact that I hadn&rsquo;t any
      influence with you and that was a thing I had no mind to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to me that it is better to have a good man&rsquo;s flattering
      estimate of my influence&mdash;and to keep it&mdash;than to fool it away
      with trying to get him an office. But when my brother&mdash;on my wife&rsquo;s
      side&mdash;Mr. Charles J. Langdon&mdash;late of the Chicago Convention&mdash;desires
      me to speak a word for Mr. Fred Douglass, I am not asked &ldquo;to use my
      influence&rdquo; consequently I am not risking anything. So I am writing
      this as a simple citizen. I am not drawing on my fund of influence at all.
      A simple citizen may express a desire with all propriety, in the matter of
      a recommendation to office, and so I beg permission to hope that you will
      retain Mr. Douglass in his present office of Marshall of the District of
      Columbia, if such a course will not clash with your own preferences or
      with the expediencies and interest of your administration. I offer this
      petition with peculiar pleasure and strong desire, because I so honor this
      man&rsquo;s high and blemishless character and so admire his brave, long
      crusade for the liberties and elevation of his race.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a personal friend of mine, but that is nothing to the point, his
      history would move me to say these things without that, and I feel them
      too.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               With great respect
                         I am, General,
                                   Yours truly,

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Clemens would go out of his way any time to grant favor to the
     colored race.  His childhood associations were partly accountable
     for this, but he also felt that the white man owed the negro a debt
     for generations of enforced bondage.  He would lecture any time in a
     colored church, when he would as likely as not refuse point-blank to
     speak for a white congregation.  Once, in Elmira, he received a
     request, poorly and none too politely phrased, to speak for one of
     the churches.  He was annoyed and about to send a brief refusal,
     when Mrs. Clemens, who was present, said:

     &ldquo;I think I know that church, and if so this preacher is a colored
     man; he does not know how to write a polished letter&mdash;how should
     he?&rdquo;  Her husband&rsquo;s manner changed so suddenly that she added:
     &ldquo;I will give you a motto, and it will be useful to you if you will
     adopt it: Consider every man colored until he is proved white.&rdquo;

    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I go to West Point with Twichell tomorrow, but
      shall be back Tuesday or Wednesday; and then just as soon thereafter as
      you and Mrs. Howells and Winny can come you will find us ready and most
      glad to see you&mdash;and the longer you can stay the gladder we shall be.
      I am not going to have a thing to do, but you shall work if you want to.
      On the evening of March 10th, I am going to read to the colored folk in
      the African Church here (no whites admitted except such as I bring with
      me), and a choir of colored folk will sing jubilee songs. I count on a
      good time, and shall hope to have you folks there, and Livy. I read in
      Twichell&rsquo;s chapel Friday night and had a most rattling high time&mdash;but
      the thing that went best of all was Uncle Remus&rsquo;s Tar Baby. I mean
      to try that on my dusky audience. They&rsquo;ve all heard that tale from
      childhood&mdash;at least the older members have.
    </p>
    <p>
      I arrived home in time to make a most noble blunder&mdash;invited Charley
      Warner here (in Livy&rsquo;s name) to dinner with the Gerhardts, and told
      him Livy had invited his wife by letter and by word of mouth also. I don&rsquo;t
      know where I got these impressions, but I came home feeling as one does
      who realizes that he has done a neat thing for once and left no flaws or
      loop-holes. Well, Livy said she had never told me to invite Charley and
      she hadn&rsquo;t dreamed of inviting Susy, and moreover there wasn&rsquo;t
      any dinner, but just one lean duck. But Susy Warner&rsquo;s intuitions
      were correct&mdash;so she choked off Charley, and staid home herself&mdash;we
      waited dinner an hour and you ought to have seen that duck when he was
      done drying in the oven.

     Clemens and his wife were always privately assisting worthy and
     ambitious young people along the way of achievement.  Young actors
     were helped through dramatic schools; young men and women were
     assisted through college and to travel abroad.  Among others Clemens
     paid the way of two colored students, one through a Southern
     institution and another through the Yale law school.

                                        HARTFORD, Feb. 21, 1881.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Well, here is our romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened in this way. One morning, a month ago&mdash;no, three weeks&mdash;Livy,
      and Clara Spaulding and I were at breakfast, at 10 A.M., and I was in an
      irritable mood, for the barber was up stairs waiting and his hot water
      getting cold, when the colored George returned from answering the bell and
      said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady in the drawing-room wants to see you.&rdquo;
      &ldquo;A book agent!&rdquo; says I, with heat. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t see
      her; I will die in my tracks, first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I got up with a soul full of rage, and went in there and bent
      scowling over that person, and began a succession of rude and raspy
      questions&mdash;and without even offering to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not even the defendant&rsquo;s youth and beauty and (seeming) timidity
      were able to modify my savagery, for a time&mdash;and meantime question
      and answer were going on. She had risen to her feet with the first
      question; and there she stood, with her pretty face bent floorward whilst
      I inquired, but always with her honest eyes looking me in the face when it
      came her turn to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was her tale, and her plea-diffidently stated, but
      straight-forwardly; and bravely, and most winningly simply and earnestly:
      I put it in my own fashion, for I do not remember her words:
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Karl Gerhardt, who works in Pratt &amp; Whitney&rsquo;s machine shops,
      has made a statue in clay, and would I be so kind as to come and look at
      it, and tell him if there is any promise in it? He has none to go to, and
      he would be so glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, dear me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about
      art&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing I could tell him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But she went on, just as earnestly and as simply as before, with her plea&mdash;and
      so she did after repeated rebuffs; and dull as I am, even I began by and
      by to admire this brave and gentle persistence, and to perceive how her
      heart of hearts was in this thing, and how she couldn&rsquo;t give it up,
      but must carry her point. So at last I wavered, and promised in general
      terms that I would come down the first day that fell idle&mdash;and as I
      conducted her to the door, I tamed more and more, and said I would come
      during the very next week&mdash;&ldquo;We shall be so glad&mdash;but&mdash;but,
      would you please come early in the week?&mdash;the statue is just finished
      and we are so anxious&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;we did hope you could come
      this week&mdash;and&rdquo;&mdash;well, I came down another peg, and said I
      would come Monday, as sure as death; and before I got to the dining room
      remorse was doing its work and I was saying to myself, &ldquo;Damnation,
      how can a man be such a hound? why didn&rsquo;t I go with her now?&rdquo;
      Yes, and how mean I should have felt if I had known that out of her
      poverty she had hired a hack and brought it along to convey me. But
      luckily for what was left of my peace of mind, I didn&rsquo;t know that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it appears that from here she went to Charley Warner&rsquo;s. There
      was a better light, there, and the eloquence of her face had a better
      chance to do its office. Warner fought, as I had done; and he was in the
      midst of an article and very busy; but no matter, she won him completely.
      He laid aside his MS and said, &ldquo;Come, let us go and see your father&rsquo;s
      statue. That is&mdash;is he your father?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, he is my
      husband.&rdquo; So this child was married, you see.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a Saturday. Next day Warner came to dinner and said &ldquo;Go!&mdash;go
      tomorrow&mdash;don&rsquo;t fail.&rdquo; He was in love with the girl, and
      with her husband too, and said he believed there was merit in the statue.
      Pretty crude work, maybe, but merit in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patrick and I hunted up the place, next day; the girl saw us driving up,
      and flew down the stairs and received me. Her quarters were the second
      story of a little wooden house&mdash;another family on the ground floor.
      The husband was at the machine shop, the wife kept no servant, she was
      there alone. She had a little parlor, with a chair or two and a sofa; and
      the artist-husband&rsquo;s hand was visible in a couple of plaster busts,
      one of the wife, and another of a neighbor&rsquo;s child; visible also in
      a couple of water colors of flowers and birds; an ambitious unfinished
      portrait of his wife in oils: some paint decorations on the pine mantel;
      and an excellent human ear, done in some plastic material at 16.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we went into the kitchen, and the girl flew around, with enthusiasm,
      and snatched rag after rag from a tall something in the corner, and
      presently there stood the clay statue, life size&mdash;a graceful girlish
      creature, nude to the waist, and holding up a single garment with one hand
      the expression attempted being a modified scare&mdash;she was interrupted
      when about to enter the bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then this young wife posed herself alongside the image and so remained&mdash;a
      thing I didn&rsquo;t understand. But presently I did&mdash;then I said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I was the model. He has no model but
      me. I have stood for this many and many an hour&mdash;and you can&rsquo;t
      think how it does tire one! But I don&rsquo;t mind it. He works all day at
      the shop; and then, nights and Sundays he works on his statue as long as I
      can keep up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She got a big chisel, to use as a lever, and between us we managed to
      twist the pedestal round and round, so as to afford a view of the statue
      from all points. Well, sir, it was perfectly charming, this girl&rsquo;s
      innocence and purity&mdash;-exhibiting her naked self, as it were, to a
      stranger and alone, and never once dreaming that there was the slightest
      indelicacy about the matter. And so there wasn&rsquo;t; but it will be
      many along day before I run across another woman who can do the like and
      show no trace of self-consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then we sat down, and I took a smoke, and she told me all about her
      people in Massachusetts&mdash;her father is a physician and it is an old
      and respectable family&mdash;(I am able to believe anything she says.) And
      she told me how &ldquo;Karl&rdquo; is 26 years old; and how he has had
      passionate longings all his life toward art, but has always been poor and
      obliged to struggle for his daily bread; and how he felt sure that if he
      could only have one or two lessons in&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lessons? Hasn&rsquo;t he had any lessons?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No. He had never had a lesson.
    </p>
    <p>
      And presently it was dinner time and &ldquo;Karl&rdquo; arrived&mdash;a
      slender young fellow with a marvelous head and a noble eye&mdash;and he
      was as simple and natural, and as beautiful in spirit as his wife was. But
      she had to do the talking&mdash;mainly&mdash;there was too much thought
      behind his cavernous eyes for glib speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went home enchanted. Told Livy and Clara Spaulding all about the
      paradise down yonder where those two enthusiasts are happy with a yearly
      expense of $350. Livy and Clara went there next day and came away
      enchanted. A few nights later the Gerhardts kept their promise and came
      here for the evening. It was billiard night and I had company and so was
      not down; but Livy and Clara became more charmed with these children than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warner and I planned to get somebody to criticise the statue whose
      judgment would be worth something. So I laid for Champney, and after two
      failures I captured him and took him around, and he said &ldquo;this
      statue is full of faults&mdash;but it has merits enough in it to make up
      for them&rdquo;&mdash;whereat the young wife danced around as delighted as
      a child. When we came away, Champney said, &ldquo;I did not want to say
      too much there, but the truth is, it seems to me an extraordinary
      performance for an untrained hand. You ask if there is promise enough
      there to justify the Hartford folk in going to an expense of training this
      young man. I should say, yes, decidedly; but still, to make everything
      safe, you had better get the judgment of a sculptor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Warner was in New York. I wrote him, and he said he would fetch up Ward&mdash;which
      he did. Yesterday they went to the Gerhardts and spent two hours, and Ward
      came away bewitched with those people and marveling at the winning
      innocence of the young wife, who dropped naturally into model-attitude
      beside the statue (which is stark naked from head to heel, now&mdash;G.
      had removed the drapery, fearing Ward would think he was afraid to try
      legs and hips) just as she has always done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Livy and I had two long talks with Ward yesterday evening. He spoke
      strongly. He said, &ldquo;if any stranger had told me that this apprentice
      did not model that thing from plaster casts, I would not have believed it.&rdquo;
      He said &ldquo;it is full of crudities, but it is full of genius, too. It
      is such a statue as the man of average talent would achieve after two
      years training in the schools. And the boldness of the fellow, in going
      straight to nature! He is an apprentice&mdash;his work shows that, all
      over; but the stuff is in him, sure. Hartford must send him to Paris&mdash;two
      years; then if the promise holds good, keep him there three more&mdash;and
      warn him to study, study, work, work, and keep his name out of the papers,
      and neither ask for orders nor accept them when offered.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you see, that&rsquo;s all we wanted. After Ward was gone Livy came
      out with the thing that was in her mind. She said, &ldquo;Go privately and
      start the Gerhardts off to Paris, and say nothing about it to any one
      else.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So I tramped down this morning in the snow-storm&mdash;and there was a
      stirring time. They will sail a week or ten days from now.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I was starting out at the front door, with Gerhardt beside me and the
      young wife dancing and jubilating behind, this latter cried out
      impulsively, &ldquo;Tell Mrs. Clemens I want to hug her&mdash;I want to
      hug you both!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave them my old French book and they were going to tackle the language,
      straight off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this letter is a secret&mdash;keep it quiet&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think
      Livy would mind my telling you these things, but then she might, you know,
      for she is a queer girl.

     Champney was J. Wells Champney, a portrait-painter of distinction;

     to make their dreams reality; in due time the letters will report

     The Uncle Remus tales of Joel Chandler Harris gave Mark Twain great
     pleasure.  He frequently read them aloud, not only at home but in
     public.  Finally, he wrote Harris, expressing his warm appreciation,
     and mentioning one of the negro stories of his own childhood, &ldquo;The
     Golden Arm,&rdquo; which he urged Harris to look up and add to his

     &ldquo;You have pinned a proud feather in Uncle-Remus&rsquo;s cap,&rdquo; replied
     Harris.  &ldquo;I do not know what higher honor he could have than to
     appear before the Hartford public arm in arm with Mark Twain.&rdquo;

     He disclaimed any originality for the stories, adding, &ldquo;I understand
     that my relations toward Uncle Remus are similar to those that exist
     between an almanac maker and the calendar.&rdquo;  He had not heard the
     &ldquo;Golden Arm&rdquo; story and asked for the outlines; also for some
     publishing advice, out of Mark Twain&rsquo;s long experience.

    <p>
      MY DEAR MR. HARRIS,&mdash;You can argue yourself into the delusion that
      the principle of life is in the stories themselves and not in their
      setting; but you will save labor by stopping with that solitary convert,
      for he is the only intelligent one you will bag. In reality the stories
      are only alligator pears&mdash;one merely eats them for the sake of the
      salad-dressing. Uncle Remus is most deftly drawn, and is a lovable and
      delightful creation; he, and the little boy, and their relations with each
      other, are high and fine literature, and worthy to live, for their own
      sakes; and certainly the stories are not to be credited with them. But
      enough of this; I seem to be proving to the man that made the
      multiplication table that twice one are two.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been thinking, yesterday and to-day (plenty of chance to think, as
      I am abed with lumbago at our little summering farm among the solitudes of
      the Mountaintops,) and I have concluded that I can answer one of your
      questions with full confidence&mdash;thus: Make it a subscription book.
      Mighty few books that come strictly under the head of literature will sell
      by subscription; but if Uncle Remus won&rsquo;t, the gift of prophecy has
      departed out of me. When a book will sell by subscription, it will sell
      two or three times as many copies as it would in the trade; and the profit
      is bulkier because the retail price is greater.....
    </p>
    <p>
      You didn&rsquo;t ask me for a subscription-publisher. If you had, I should
      have recommended Osgood to you. He inaugurates his subscription department
      with my new book in the fall.....
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the doctor has been here and tried to interrupt my yarn about &ldquo;The
      Golden Arm,&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve got through, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course I tell it in the negro dialect&mdash;that is necessary; but I
      have not written it so, for I can&rsquo;t spell it in your matchless way.
      It is marvelous the way you and Cable spell the negro and creole dialects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two grand features are lost in print: the weird wailing, the rising and
      falling cadences of the wind, so easily mimicked with one&rsquo;s mouth;
      and the impressive pauses and eloquent silences, and subdued utterances,
      toward the end of the yarn (which chain the attention of the children hand
      and foot, and they sit with parted lips and breathless, to be wrenched
      limb from limb with the sudden and appalling &ldquo;You got it&rdquo;).
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Uncle Dan&rsquo;l, a slave of my uncle&rsquo;s&rsquo; aged 60, used to
      tell us children yarns every night by the kitchen fire (no other light;)
      and the last yarn demanded, every night, was this one. By this time there
      was but a ghastly blaze or two flickering about the back-log. We would
      huddle close about the old man, and begin to shudder with the first
      familiar words; and under the spell of his impressive delivery we always
      fell a prey to that climax at the end when the rigid black shape in the
      twilight sprang at us with a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you come to glance at the tale you will recollect it&mdash;it is as
      common and familiar as the Tar Baby. Work up the atmosphere with your
      customary skill and it will &ldquo;go&rdquo; in print.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lumbago seems to make a body garrulous&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll forgive it.

     The &ldquo;Golden Arm&rdquo; story was one that Clemens often used in his public
     readings, and was very effective as he gave it.

     In his sketch, &ldquo;How to Tell a Story,&rdquo; it appears about as he used to
     tell it.  Harris, receiving the outlines of the old Missouri tale,
     presently announced that he had dug up its Georgia relative, an
     interesting variant, as we gather from Mark Twain&rsquo;s reply.

      MY DEAR MR. HARRIS,&mdash;I was very sure you would run across that Story
      somewhere, and am glad you have. A Drummond light&mdash;no, I mean a Brush
      light&mdash;is thrown upon the negro estimate of values by his willingness
      to risk his soul and his mighty peace forever for the sake of a silver sev&rsquo;m-punce.
      And this form of the story seems rather nearer the true field-hand
      standard than that achieved by my Florida, Mo., negroes with their
      sumptuous arm of solid gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      I judge you haven&rsquo;t received my new book yet&mdash;however, you will

      When you come north I wish you would drop me a line and then follow it in
      person and give me a day or two at our house in Hartford. If you will, I
      will snatch Osgood down from Boston, and you won&rsquo;t have to go there

     Charles Warren Stoddard, to whom the next letter is written, was one
     of the old California literary crowd, a graceful writer of verse and
     prose, never quite arriving at the success believed by his friends
     to be his due.  He was a gentle, irresponsible soul, well loved by
     all who knew him, and always, by one or another, provided against
     want.  The reader may remember that during Mark Twain&rsquo;s great
     lecture engagement in London, winter of 1873-74, Stoddard lived with
     him, acting as his secretary.  At a later period in his life he
     lived for several years with the great telephone magnate, Theodore
     N. Vail.  At the time of this letter, Stoddard had decided that in
     the warm light and comfort of the Sandwich Islands he could survive
     on his literary earnings.

    <p>
      MY DEAR CHARLIE,&mdash;Now what have I ever done to you that you should
      not only slide off to Heaven before you have earned a right to go, but
      must add the gratuitous villainy of informing me of it?...
    </p>
    <p>
      The house is full of carpenters and decorators; whereas, what we really
      need here, is an incendiary. If the house would only burn down, we would
      pack up the cubs and fly to the isles of the blest, and shut ourselves up
      in the healing solitudes of the crater of Haleakala and get a good rest;
      for the mails do not intrude there, nor yet the telephone and the
      telegraph. And after resting, we would come down the mountain a piece and
      board with a godly, breech-clouted native, and eat poi and dirt and give
      thanks to whom all thanks belong, for these privileges, and never
      house-keep any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think my wife would be twice as strong as she is, but for this wearing
      and wearying slavery of house-keeping. However, she thinks she must submit
      to it for the sake of the children; whereas, I have always had a
      tenderness for parents too, so, for her sake and mine, I sigh for the
      incendiary. When the evening comes and the gas is lit and the wear and
      tear of life ceases, we want to keep house always; but next morning we
      wish, once more, that we were free and irresponsible boarders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work?&mdash;one can&rsquo;t you know, to any purpose. I don&rsquo;t really
      get anything done worth speaking of, except during the three or four
      months that we are away in the Summer. I wish the Summer were seven years
      long. I keep three or four books on the stocks all the time, but I seldom
      add a satisfactory chapter to one of them at home. Yes, and it is all
      because my time is taken up with answering the letters of strangers. It
      can&rsquo;t be done through a short hand amanuensis&mdash;I&rsquo;ve tried
      that&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t work&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t learn to dictate.
      What does possess strangers to write so many letters? I never could find
      that out. However, I suppose I did it myself when I was a stranger. But I
      will never do it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe you think I am not happy? the very thing that gravels me is that I
      am. I don&rsquo;t want to be happy when I can&rsquo;t work; I am resolved
      that hereafter I won&rsquo;t be. What I have always longed for, was the
      privilege of living forever away up on one of those mountains in the
      Sandwich Islands overlooking the sea.

    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I am delighted with your review, and so is Mrs.
      Clemens. What you have said, there, will convince anybody that reads it; a
      body cannot help being convinced by it. That is the kind of a review to
      have; the doubtful man; even the prejudiced man, is persuaded and
      succumbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a queer blunder that was, about the baronet. I can&rsquo;t quite see
      how I ever made it. There was an opulent abundance of things I didn&rsquo;t
      know; and consequently no need to trench upon the vest-pocketful of things
      I did know, to get material for a blunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charley Warren Stoddard has gone to the Sandwich Islands permanently.
      Lucky devil. It is the only supremely delightful place on earth. It does
      seem that the more advantage a body doesn&rsquo;t earn, here, the more of
      them God throws at his head. This fellow&rsquo;s postal card has set the
      vision of those gracious islands before my mind, again, with not a leaf
      withered, nor a rainbow vanished, nor a sun-flash missing from the waves,
      and now it will be months, I reckon, before I can drive it away again. It
      is beautiful company, but it makes one restless and dissatisfied.

     The review mentioned in this letter was of The Prince and the
     Pauper.  What the queer &ldquo;blunder&rdquo; about the baronet was, the present
     writer confesses he does not know; but perhaps a careful reader
     could find it, at least in the early edition; very likely it was
     corrected without loss of time.

     Clemens now and then found it necessary to pay a visit to Canada in
     the effort to protect his copyright.  He usually had a grand time on
     these trips, being lavishly entertained by the Canadian literary
     fraternity.  In November, 1881, he made one of these journeys in the
     interest of The Prince and the Pauper, this time with Osgood, who
     was now his publisher.  In letters written home we get a hint of his
     diversions.  The Monsieur Frechette mentioned was a Canadian poet of
     considerable distinction.  &ldquo;Clara&rdquo; was Miss Clara Spaulding, of
     Elmira, who had accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Clemens to Europe in 1873,
     and again in 1878.  Later she became Mrs. John B. Staachfield, of
     New York City.  Her name has already appeared in these letters many
     times.

      Livy dear, a mouse kept me awake last night till 3 or 4 o&rsquo;clock&mdash;so

    <p>
      I can not only look out upon the beautiful snow-storm, past the vigorous
      blaze of my fire; and upon the snow-veiled buildings which I have
      sketched; and upon the churchward drifting umbrellas; and upon the
      buffalo-clad cabmen stamping their feet and thrashing their arms on the
      corner yonder: but I also look out upon the spot where the first white men
      stood, in the neighborhood of four hundred years ago, admiring the mighty
      stretch of leafy solitudes, and being admired and marveled at by an eager
      multitude of naked savages. The discoverer of this region, and namer of

      Livy darling, I received a letter from Monsieur Frechette this morning, in
      which certain citizens of Montreal tendered me a public dinner next
      Thursday, and by Osgood&rsquo;s advice I accepted it. I would have
      accepted anyway, and very cheerfully but for the delay of two days&mdash;for
      I was purposing to go to Boston Tuesday and home Wednesday; whereas, now I
      go to Boston Friday and home Saturday. I have to go by Boston on account
      of business.
    </p>
    <p>
      We drove about the steep hills and narrow, crooked streets of this old
      town during three hours, yesterday, in a sleigh, in a driving snow-storm.
      The people here don&rsquo;t mind snow; they were all out, plodding around
      on their affairs&mdash;especially the children, who were wallowing around
      everywhere, like snow images, and having a mighty good time. I wish I
      could describe the winter costume of the young girls, but I can&rsquo;t.
      It is grave and simple, but graceful and pretty&mdash;the top of it is a
      brimless fur cap. Maybe it is the costume that makes pretty girls seem so
      monotonously plenty here. It was a kind of relief to strike a homely face
      occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      You descend into some of the streets by long, deep stairways; and in the
      strong moonlight, last night, these were very picturesque. I did wish you

      in these beds, though, or enjoy the food.

    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;It was a sharp disappointment&mdash;your inability
      to connect, on the Canadian raid. What a gaudy good time we should have
      had!
    </p>
    <p>
      Disappointed, again, when I got back to Boston; for I was promising myself
      half an hour&rsquo;s look at you, in Belmont; but your note to Osgood
      showed that that could not be allowed out yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Atlantic arrived an hour ago, and your faultless and delicious Police
      Report brought that blamed Joe Twichell powerfully before me. There&rsquo;s
      a man who can tell such things himself (by word of mouth,) and has as sure
      an eye for detecting a thing that is before his eyes, as any man in the
      world, perhaps&mdash;then why in the nation doesn&rsquo;t he report
      himself with a pen?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of those drenching days last week, he slopped down town with his cubs,
      and visited a poor little beggarly shed where were a dwarf, a fat woman,
      and a giant of honest eight feet, on exhibition behind tawdry
      show-canvases, but with nobody to exhibit to. The giant had a broom, and
      was cleaning up and fixing around, diligently. Joe conceived the idea of
      getting some talk out of him. Now that never would have occurred to me. So
      he dropped in under the man&rsquo;s elbow, dogged him patiently around,
      prodding him with questions and getting irritated snarls in return which
      would have finished me early&mdash;but at last one of Joe&rsquo;s random
      shafts drove the centre of that giant&rsquo;s sympathies somehow, and
      fetched him. The fountains of his great deep were broken up, and he rained
      a flood of personal history that was unspeakably entertaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other things it turned out that he had been a Turkish (native)
      colonel, and had fought all through the Crimean war&mdash;and so, for the
      first time, Joe got a picture of the Charge of the Six Hundred that made
      him see the living spectacle, the flash of flag and tongue-flame, the
      rolling smoke, and hear the booming of the guns; and for the first time
      also, he heard the reasons for that wild charge delivered from the mouth
      of a master, and realized that nobody had &ldquo;blundered,&rdquo; but
      that a cold, logical, military brain had perceived this one and sole way
      to win an already lost battle, and so gave the command and did achieve the
      victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      And mind you Joe was able to come up here, days afterwards, and reproduce
      that giant&rsquo;s picturesque and admirable history. But dern him, he can&rsquo;t
      write it&mdash;which is all wrong, and not as it should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he has gone and raked up the MS autobiography (written in 1848,) of
      Mrs. Phebe Brown, (author of &ldquo;I Love to Steal a While Away,&rdquo;)
      who educated Yung Wing in her family when he was a little boy; and I came
      near not getting to bed at all, last night, on account of the lurid
      fascinations of it. Why in the nation it has never got into print, I can&rsquo;t
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, by jings! the postman will be here in a minute; so, congratulations
      upon your mending health, and gratitude that it is mending; and love to
      you all.

      XXII. LETTERS, 1882, MAINLY TO HOWELLS. WASTED FURY. OLD SCENES REVISITED.
      THE MISSISSIPPI BOOK.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     A man of Mark Twain&rsquo;s profession and prominence must necessarily be
     the subject of much newspaper comment.  Jest, compliment, criticism
     &mdash;none of these things disturbed him, as a rule.  He was pleased
     that his books should receive favorable notices by men whose opinion
     he respected, but he was not grieved by adverse expressions.  Jests
     at his expense, if well written, usually amused him; cheap jokes
     only made him sad; but sarcasms and innuendoes were likely to enrage
     him, particularly if he believed them prompted by malice.  Perhaps
     among all the letters he ever wrote, there is none more
     characteristic than this confession of violence and eagerness for
     reprisal, followed by his acknowledgment of error and a manifest
     appreciation of his own weakness.  It should be said that Mark Twain
     and Whitelaw Reid were generally very good friends, and perhaps for
     the moment this fact seemed to magnify the offense.

      To W. D. Howells, in Boston:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        HARTFORD, Jan.  28 &lsquo;82.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Nobody knows better than I, that there are times
      when swearing cannot meet the emergency. How sharply I feel that, at this
      moment. Not a single profane word has issued from my lips this mornin&mdash;I
      have not even had the impulse to swear, so wholly ineffectual would
      swearing have manifestly been, in the circumstances. But I will tell you
      about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three weeks ago, a sensitive friend, approaching his revelation
      cautiously, intimated that the N. Y. Tribune was engaged in a kind of
      crusade against me. This seemed a higher compliment than I deserved; but
      no matter, it made me very angry. I asked many questions, and gathered, in
      substance, this: Since Reid&rsquo;s return from Europe, the Tribune had
      been flinging sneers and brutalities at me with such persistent frequency
      &ldquo;as to attract general remark.&rdquo; I was an angered&mdash;which
      is just as good an expression, I take it, as an hungered. Next, I learned
      that Osgood, among the rest of the &ldquo;general,&rdquo; was worrying
      over these constant and pitiless attacks. Next came the testimony of
      another friend, that the attacks were not merely &ldquo;frequent,&rdquo;
      but &ldquo;almost daily.&rdquo; Reflect upon that: &ldquo;Almost daily&rdquo;
      insults, for two months on a stretch. What would you have done?
    </p>
    <p>
      As for me, I did the thing which was the natural thing for me to do, that
      is, I set about contriving a plan to accomplish one or the other of two
      things: 1. Force a peace; or 2. Get revenge. When I got my plan finished,
      it pleased me marvelously. It was in six or seven sections, each section
      to be used in its turn and by itself; the assault to begin at once with
      No. 1, and the rest to follow, one after the other, to keep the
      communication open while I wrote my biography of Reid. I meant to wind up
      with this latter great work, and then dismiss the subject for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, ever since then I have worked day and night making notes and
      collecting and classifying material. I&rsquo;ve got collectors at work in
      England. I went to New York and sat three hours taking evidence while a
      stenographer set it down. As my labors grew, so also grew my fascination.
      Malice and malignity faded out of me&mdash;or maybe I drove them out of
      me, knowing that a malignant book would hurt nobody but the fool who wrote
      it. I got thoroughly in love with this work; for I saw that I was going to
      write a book which the very devils and angels themselves would delight to
      read, and which would draw disapproval from nobody but the hero of it,
      (and Mrs. Clemens, who was bitter against the whole thing.) One part of my
      plan was so delicious that I had to try my hand on it right away, just for
      the luxury of it. I set about it, and sure enough it panned out to
      admiration. I wrote that chapter most carefully, and I couldn&rsquo;t find
      a fault with it. (It was not for the biography&mdash;no, it belonged to an
      immediate and deadlier project.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, five days ago, this thought came into my mind (from Mrs. Clemens&rsquo;s):
      &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be well to make sure that the attacks have been
      &lsquo;almost daily&rsquo;?&mdash;and to also make sure that their number
      and character will justify me in doing what I am proposing to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I at once set a man to work in New York to seek out and copy every
      unpleasant reference which had been made to me in the Tribune from Nov.
      1st to date. On my own part I began to watch the current numbers, for I
      had subscribed for the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result arrived from my New York man this morning. O, what a pitiable
      wreck of high hopes! The &ldquo;almost daily&rdquo; assaults, for two
      months, consist of&mdash;1. Adverse criticism of P. &amp; P. from an
      enraged idiot in the London Atheneum; 2. Paragraph from some indignant
      Englishman in the Pall Mall Gazette who pays me the vast compliment of
      gravely rebuking some imaginary ass who has set me up in the neighborhood
      of Rabelais; 3. A remark of the Tribune&rsquo;s about the Montreal dinner,
      touched with an almost invisible satire; 4. A remark of the Tribune&rsquo;s
      about refusal of Canadian copyright, not complimentary, but not
      necessarily malicious&mdash;and of course adverse criticism which is not
      malicious is a thing which none but fools irritate themselves about.
    </p>
    <p>
      There&mdash;that is the prodigious bugaboo, in its entirety! Can you
      conceive of a man&rsquo;s getting himself into a sweat over so diminutive
      a provocation? I am sure I can&rsquo;t. What the devil can those friends
      of mine have been thinking about, to spread these 3 or 4 harmless things
      out into two months of daily sneers and affronts? The whole offense,
      boiled down, amounts to just this: one uncourteous remark of the Tribune
      about my book&mdash;not me between Nov. 1 and Dec. 20; and a couple of
      foreign criticisms (of my writings, not me,) between Nov. 1 and Jan. 26!
      If I can&rsquo;t stand that amount of friction, I certainly need
      reconstruction. Further boiled down, this vast outpouring of malice
      amounts to simply this: one jest from the Tribune (one can make nothing
      more serious than that out of it.) One jest&mdash;and that is all; for the
      foreign criticisms do not count, they being matters of news, and proper
      for publication in anybody&rsquo;s newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to offset that one jest, the Tribune paid me one compliment Dec. 23,
      by publishing my note declining the New York New England dinner, while
      merely (in the same breath,) mentioning that similar letters were read
      from General Sherman and other men whom we all know to be persons of real
      consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, my mountain has brought forth its mouse, and a sufficiently small
      mouse it is, God knows. And my three weeks&rsquo; hard work have got to go
      into the ignominious pigeon-hole. Confound it, I could have earned ten
      thousand dollars with infinitely less trouble. However, I shouldn&rsquo;t
      have done it, for I am too lazy, now, in my sere and yellow leaf, to be
      willing to work for anything but love..... I kind of envy you people who
      are permitted for your righteousness&rsquo; sake to dwell in a boarding
      house; not that I should always want to live in one, but I should like the
      change occasionally from this housekeeping slavery to that wild
      independence. A life of don&rsquo;t-care-a-damn in a boarding house is
      what I have asked for in many a secret prayer. I shall come by and by and
      require of you what you have offered me there.

     Howells, who had already known something of the gathering storm,
     replied: &ldquo;Your letter was an immense relief to me, for although I
     had an abiding faith that you would get sick of your enterprise,
     I wasn&rsquo;t easy until I knew that you had given it up.&rdquo;

     Joel Chandler Harris appears again in the letters of this period.
     Twichell, during a trip South about this time, had called on Harris
     with some sort of proposition or suggestion from Clemens that Harris
     appear with him in public, and tell, or read, the Remus stories from
     the platform.  But Harris was abnormally diffident.  Clemens later
     pronounced him &ldquo;the shyest full-grown man&rdquo; he had ever met, and the
     word which Twichell brought home evidently did not encourage the
     platform idea.

      To Joel Chandler Harris, in Atlanta:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                             HARTFORD, Apl. 2, &lsquo;82.
</pre>
    <p>
      Private.
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR MR. HARRIS,&mdash;Jo Twichell brought me your note and told me of
      his talk with you. He said you didn&rsquo;t believe you would ever be able
      to muster a sufficiency of reckless daring to make you comfortable and at
      ease before an audience. Well, I have thought out a device whereby I
      believe we can get around that difficulty. I will explain when I see you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo says you want to go to Canada within a month or six weeks&mdash;I
      forget just exactly what he did say; but he intimated the trip could be
      delayed a while, if necessary. If this is so, suppose you meet Osgood and
      me in New Orleans early in May&mdash;say somewhere between the 1st and
      6th?
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be well worth your while to do this, because the author who goes
      to Canada unposted, will not know what course to pursue [to secure
      copyright] when he gets there; he will find himself in a hopeless
      confusion as to what is the correct thing to do. Now Osgood is the only
      man in America, who can lay out your course for you and tell you exactly
      what to do. Therefore, you just come to New Orleans and have a talk with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our idea is to strike across lots and reach St. Louis the 20th of April&mdash;thence
      we propose to drift southward, stopping at some town a few hours or a
      night, every day, and making notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      To escape the interviewers, I shall follow my usual course and use a
      fictitious name (C. L. Samuel, of New York.) I don&rsquo;t know what
      Osgood&rsquo;s name will be, but he can&rsquo;t use his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you see your way to meet us in New Orleans, drop me a line, now, and as
      we approach that city I will telegraph you what day we shall arrive there.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would go to Atlanta if I could, but shan&rsquo;t be able. We shall go
      back up the river to St. Paul, and thence by rail X-lots home.
    </p>
    <p>
      (I am making this letter so dreadfully private and confidential because my
      movements must be kept secret, else I shan&rsquo;t be able to pick up the
      kind of book-material I want.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are diffident, I suspect that you ought to let Osgood be your
      magazine-agent. He makes those people pay three or four times as much as
      an article is worth, whereas I never had the cheek to make them pay more
      than double.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                              Yrs Sincerely
                                        S. L. CLEMENS.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;My backwardness is an affliction,&rdquo; wrote Harris.....  &ldquo;The ordeal
     of appearing on the stage would be a terrible one, but my experience
     is that when a diffident man does become familiar with his
     surroundings he has more impudence than his neighbors.  Extremes
     meet.&rdquo;

     He was sorely tempted, but his courage became as water at the
     thought of footlights and assembled listeners.  Once in New York he
     appears to have been caught unawares at a Tile Club dinner and made
     to tell a story, but his agony was such that at the prospect of a
     similar ordeal in Boston he avoided that city and headed straight
     for Georgia and safety.

     The New Orleans excursion with Osgood, as planned by Clemens, proved
     a great success.  The little party took the steamer Gold Dust from
     St. Louis down river toward New Orleans.  Clemens was quickly
     recognized, of course, and his assumed name laid aside.  The author
     of &ldquo;Uncle Remus&rdquo; made the trip to New Orleans.  George W. Cable was
     there at the time, and we may believe that in the company of Mark
     Twain and Osgood those Southern authors passed two or three
     delightful days.  Clemens also met his old teacher Bixby in New
     Orleans, and came back up the river with him, spending most of his
     time in the pilot-house, as in the old days.  It was a glorious
     trip, and, reaching St. Louis, he continued it northward, stopping
     off at Hannibal and Quincy.&rsquo;

</pre>
    <p>
      Livy darling, I am desperately homesick. But I have promised Osgood, and
      must stick it out; otherwise I would take the train at once and break for
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have spent three delightful days in Hannibal, loitering around all day
      long, examining the old localities and talking with the grey-heads who
      were boys and girls with me 30 or 40 years ago. It has been a moving time.
      I spent my nights with John and Helen Garth, three miles from town, in
      their spacious and beautiful house. They were children with me, and
      afterwards schoolmates. Now they have a daughter 19 or 20 years old. Spent
      an hour, yesterday, with A. W. Lamb, who was not married when I saw him
      last. He married a young lady whom I knew. And now I have been talking
      with their grown-up sons and daughters. Lieutenant Hickman, the spruce
      young handsomely-uniformed volunteer of 1846, called on me&mdash;a grisly
      elephantine patriarch of 65 now, his grace all vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      That world which I knew in its blossoming youth is old and bowed and
      melancholy, now; its soft cheeks are leathery and wrinkled, the fire is
      gone out in its eyes, and the spring from its step. It will be dust and
      ashes when I come again. I have been clasping hands with the moribund&mdash;and
      usually they said, &ldquo;It is for the last time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I am under way again, upon this hideous trip to St. Paul, with a heart
      brimming full of thoughts and images of you and Susie and Bay and the
      peerless Jean. And so good night, my love.

      MY DEAR MR. BROWN,&mdash;I was three thousand miles from home, at
      breakfast in New Orleans, when the damp morning paper revealed the
      sorrowful news among the cable dispatches. There was no place in America,
      however remote, or however rich, or poor or high or humble where words of
      mourning for your father were not uttered that morning, for his works had
      made him known and loved all over the land. To Mrs. Clemens and me, the
      loss is personal; and our grief the grief one feels for one who was
      peculiarly near and dear. Mrs. Clemens has never ceased to express regret
      that we came away from England the last time without going to see him, and
      often we have since projected a voyage across the Atlantic for the sole
      purpose of taking him by the hand and looking into his kind eyes once more
      before he should be called to his rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We both thank you greatly for the Edinburgh papers which you sent. My wife

     William Dean Howells, at the age of forty-five, reached what many
     still regard his highest point of achievement in American realism.
     His novel, The Rise of Silas Lapham, which was running as a Century
     serial during the summer of 1882, attracted wide attention, and upon
     its issue in book form took first place among his published novels.
     Mark Twain, to the end of his life, loved all that Howells wrote.
     Once, long afterward, he said: &ldquo;Most authors give us glimpses of a
     radiant moon, but Howells&rsquo;s moon shines and sails all night long.&rdquo;
      When the instalments of The Rise of Silas Lapham began to appear, he
     overflowed in adjectives, the sincerity of which we need not doubt,
     in view of his quite open criticisms of the author&rsquo;s reading
     delivery.

    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I am in a state of wild enthusiasm over this July
      instalment of your story. It&rsquo;s perfectly dazzling&mdash;it&rsquo;s
      masterly&mdash;incomparable. Yet I heard you read it&mdash;without losing
      my balance. Well, the difference between your reading and your writing
      is-remarkable. I mean, in the effects produced and the impression left
      behind. Why, the one is to the other as is one of Joe Twichell&rsquo;s
      yarns repeated by a somnambulist. Goodness gracious, you read me a
      chapter, and it is a gentle, pearly dawn, with a sprinkle of faint stars
      in it; but by and by I strike it in print, and shout to myself, &ldquo;God

      of it as being familiar&mdash;but that is all. That is, I remember it as
      pyrotechnic figures which you set up before me, dead and cold, but ready
      for the match&mdash;and now I see them touched off and all ablaze with
      blinding fires. You can read, if you want to, but you don&rsquo;t read
      worth a damn. I know you can read, because your readings of Cable and your
      repeatings of the German doctor&rsquo;s remarks prove that.
    </p>
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s the best drunk scene&mdash;because the truest&mdash;that I
      ever read. There are touches in it that I never saw any writer take note
      of before. And they are set before the reader with amazing accuracy. How
      very drunk, and how recently drunk, and how altogether admirably drunk you
      must have been to enable you to contrive that masterpiece!
    </p>
    <p>
      Why I didn&rsquo;t notice that that religious interview between Marcia and
      Mrs. Halleck was so deliciously humorous when you read it to me&mdash;but
      dear me, it&rsquo;s just too lovely for anything. (Wrote Clark to collar
      it for the &ldquo;Library.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Hang it, I know where the mystery is, now; when you are reading, you glide
      right along, and I don&rsquo;t get a chance to let the things soak home;
      but when I catch it in the magazine, I give a page 20 or 30 minutes in
      which to gently and thoroughly filter into me. Your humor is so very
      subtle, and elusive&mdash;(well, often it&rsquo;s just a vanishing breath
      of perfume which a body isn&rsquo;t certain he smelt till he stops and
      takes another smell) whereas you can smell other...

     Among Mark Twain&rsquo;s old schoolmates in Hannibal was little Helen
     Kercheval, for whom in those early days he had a very tender spot
     indeed.  But she married another schoolmate, John Garth, who in time
     became a banker, highly respected and a great influence.  John and
     Helen Garth have already been mentioned in the letter of May 17th.

    <p>
      DEAR JOHN,&mdash;Your letter of June 19 arrived just one day after we
      ought to have been in Elmira, N. Y. for the summer: but at the last moment
      the baby was seized with scarlet fever. I had to telegraph and countermand
      the order for special sleeping car; and in fact we all had to fly around
      in a lively way and undo the patient preparations of weeks&mdash;rehabilitate
      the dismantled house, unpack the trunks, and so on. A couple of days
      later, the eldest child was taken down with so fierce a fever that she was
      soon delirious&mdash;not scarlet fever, however. Next, I myself was
      stretched on the bed with three diseases at once, and all of them fatal.
      But I never did care for fatal diseases if I could only have privacy and
      room to express myself concerning them.
    </p>
    <p>
      We gave early warning, and of course nobody has entered the house in all
      this time but one or two reckless old bachelors&mdash;and they probably
      wanted to carry the disease to the children of former flames of theirs.
      The house is still in quarantine and must remain so for a week or two yet&mdash;at
      which time we are hoping to leave for Elmira.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     By the end of summer Howells was in Europe, and Clemens, in Elmira,
     was trying to finish his Mississippi book, which was giving him a
     great deal of trouble.  It was usually so with his non-fiction
     books; his interest in them was not cumulative; he was prone to grow
     weary of them, while the menace of his publisher&rsquo;s contract was
     maddening.  Howells&rsquo;s letters, meant to be comforting, or at least
     entertaining, did not always contribute to his peace of mind.  The
     Library of American Humor which they had planned was an added
     burden.  Before sailing, Howells had written: &ldquo;Do you suppose you
     can do your share of the reading at Elmira, while you are writing at
     the Mississippi book?&rdquo;

     In a letter from London, Howells writes of the good times he is
     having over there with Osgood, Hutton, John Hay, Aldrich, and Alma
     Tadema, excursioning to Oxford, feasting, especially &ldquo;at the Mitre
     Tavern, where they let you choose your dinner from the joints
     hanging from the rafter, and have passages that you lose yourself in
     every time you try to go to your room....  Couldn&rsquo;t you and Mrs.
     Clemens step over for a little while?...  We have seen lots of
     nice people and have been most pleasantly made of; but I would
     rather have you smoke in my face, and talk for half a day just for
     pleasure, than to go to the best house or club in London.&rdquo;  The
     reader will gather that this could not be entirely soothing to a man
     shackled by a contract and a book that refused to come to an end.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I do not expect to find you, so I shan&rsquo;t
      spend many words on you to wind up in the perdition of some European
      dead-letter office. I only just want to say that the closing installments
      of the story are prodigious. All along I was afraid it would be impossible
      for you to keep up so splendidly to the end; but you were only, I see now,
      striking eleven. It is in these last chapters that you struck twelve. Go
      on and write; you can write good books yet, but you can never match this
      one. And speaking of the book, I inclose something which has been
      happening here lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have only just arrived at home, and I have not seen Clark on our
      matters. I cannot see him or any one else, until I get my book finished.
      The weather turned cold, and we had to rush home, while I still lacked
      thirty thousand words. I had been sick and got delayed. I am going to
      write all day and two thirds of the night, until the thing is done, or
      break down at it. The spur and burden of the contract are intolerable to
      me. I can endure the irritation of it no longer. I went to work at nine o&rsquo;clock
      yesterday morning, and went to bed an hour after midnight. Result of the
      day, (mainly stolen from books, tho&rsquo; credit given,) 9500 words, so I
      reduced my burden by one third in one day. It was five days work in one. I
      have nothing more to borrow or steal; the rest must all be written. It is
      ten days work, and unless something breaks, it will be finished in five.
      We all send love to you and Mrs. Howells, and all the family.

                         Yours as ever,

      Again, from Villeneuve, on lake Geneva, Howells wrote urging him this time
      to spend the winter with them in Florence, where they would write their
      great American Comedy of &lsquo;Orme&rsquo;s Motor,&rsquo; &ldquo;which is
      to enrich us beyond the dreams of avarice.... We could have a lot of fun
      writing it, and you could go home with some of the good old Etruscan
      malaria in your bones, instead of the wretched pinch-beck Hartford article
      that you are suffering from now.... it&rsquo;s a great opportunity for
      you. Besides, nobody over there likes you half as well as I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be added that &lsquo;Orme&rsquo;s Motor&rsquo; was the
      provisional title that Clemens and Howells had selected for their comedy,
      which was to be built, in some measure, at least, around the character, or
      rather from the peculiarities, of Orion Clemens. The Cable mentioned in
      Mark Twain&rsquo;s reply is, of course, George W. Cable, who only a little
      while before had come up from New Orleans to conquer the North with his
      wonderful tales and readings.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Yes, it would be profitable for me to do that,
      because with your society to help me, I should swiftly finish this now
      apparently interminable book. But I cannot come, because I am not Boss
      here, and nothing but dynamite can move Mrs. Clemens away from home in the
      winter season.
    </p>
    <p>
      I never had such a fight over a book in my life before. And the foolishest
      part of the whole business is, that I started Osgood to editing it before
      I had finished writing it. As a consequence, large areas of it are
      condemned here and there and yonder, and I have the burden of these
      unfilled gaps harassing me and the thought of the broken continuity of the
      work, while I am at the same time trying to build the last quarter of the
      book. However, at last I have said with sufficient positiveness that I
      will finish the book at no particular date; that I will not hurry it; that
      I will not hurry myself; that I will take things easy and comfortably,
      write when I choose to write, leave it alone when I so prefer. The
      printers must wait, the artists, the canvassers, and all the rest. I have
      got everything at a dead standstill, and that is where it ought to be, and
      that is where it must remain; to follow any other policy would be to make
      the book worse than it already is. I ought to have finished it before
      showing to anybody, and then sent it across the ocean to you to be edited,
      as usual; for you seem to be a great many shades happier than you deserve
      to be, and if I had thought of this thing earlier, I would have acted upon
      it and taken the tuck somewhat out of your joyousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same mail with your letter, arrived the enclosed from Orme the
      motor man. You will observe that he has an office. I will explain that
      this is a law office and I think it probably does him as much good to have
      a law office without anything to do in it, as it would another man to have
      one with an active business attached. You see he is on the electric light
      lay now. Going to light the city and allow me to take all the stock if I
      want to. And he will manage it free of charge. It never would occur to
      this simple soul how much less costly it would be to me, to hire him on a
      good salary not to manage it. Do you observe the same old eagerness, the
      same old hurry, springing from the fear that if he does not move with the
      utmost swiftness, that colossal opportunity will escape him? Now just
      fancy this same frantic plunging after vast opportunities, going on week
      after week with this same man, during fifty entire years, and he has not
      yet learned, in the slightest degree, that there isn&rsquo;t any occasion
      to hurry; that his vast opportunity will always wait; and that whether it
      waits or flies, he certainly will never catch it. This immortal
      hopefulness, fortified by its immortal and unteachable misjudgment, is the
      immortal feature of this character, for a play; and we will write that
      play. We should be fools else. That staccato postscript reads as if some
      new and mighty business were imminent, for it is slung on the paper
      telegraphically, all the small words left out. I am afraid something newer
      and bigger than the electric light is swinging across his orbit. Save this
      letter for an inspiration. I have got a hundred more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cable has been here, creating worshipers on all hands. He is a marvelous
      talker on a deep subject. I do not see how even Spencer could unwind a
      thought more smoothly or orderly, and do it in a cleaner, clearer, crisper
      English. He astounded Twichell with his faculty. You know when it comes
      down to moral honesty, limpid innocence, and utterly blemishless piety,
      the Apostles were mere policemen to Cable; so with this in mind you must
      imagine him at a midnight dinner in Boston the other night, where we
      gathered around the board of the Summerset Club; Osgood, full, Boyle O&rsquo;Reilly,
      full, Fairchild responsively loaded, and Aldrich and myself possessing the
      floor, and properly fortified. Cable told Mrs. Clemens when he returned
      here, that he seemed to have been entertaining himself with horses, and
      had a dreamy idea that he must have gone to Boston in a cattle-car. It was
      a very large time. He called it an orgy. And no doubt it was, viewed from
      his standpoint.

      XXIII. LETTERS, 1883, TO HOWELLS AND OTHERS. A GUEST OF THE MARQUIS OF
      LORNE. THE HISTORY GAME. A PLAY BY HOWELLS AND MARK TWAIN.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Mark Twain, in due season, finished the Mississippi book and placed
     it in Osgood&rsquo;s hands for publication.  It was a sort of partnership
     arrangement in which Clemens was to furnish the money to make the
     book, and pay Osgood a percentage for handling it.  It was, in fact,
     the beginning of Mark Twain&rsquo;s adventures as a publisher.

     Howells was not as happy in Florence as he had hoped to be.  The
     social life there overwhelmed him.  In February he wrote: &ldquo;Our two
     months in Florence have been the most ridiculous time that ever even
     half-witted people passed.  We have spent them in chasing round
     after people for whom we cared nothing, and being chased by them.
     My story isn&rsquo;t finished yet, and what part of it is done bears the
     fatal marks of haste and distraction.  Of course, I haven&rsquo;t put pen
     to paper yet on the play.  I wring my hands and beat my breast when
     I think of how these weeks have been wasted; and how I have been
     forced to waste them by the infernal social circumstances from which
     I couldn&rsquo;t escape.&rdquo;

     Clemens, now free from the burden of his own book, was light of
     heart and full of ideas and news; also of sympathy and appreciation.
     Howells&rsquo;s story of this time was &ldquo;A Woman&rsquo;s Reason.&rdquo;  Governor
     Jewell, of this letter, was Marshall Jewell, Governor of Connecticut
     from 1871 to 1873.  Later, he was Minister to Russia, and in 1874
     was United States Postmaster-General.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                        HARTFORD, March 1st, 1883.
</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;We got ourselves ground up in that same mill, once,
      in London, and another time in Paris. It is a kind of foretaste of hell.
      There is no way to avoid it except by the method which you have now
      chosen. One must live secretly and cut himself utterly off from the human
      race, or life in Europe becomes an unbearable burden and work an
      impossibility. I learned something last night, and maybe it may reconcile
      me to go to Europe again sometime. I attended one of the astonishingly
      popular lectures of a man by the name of Stoddard, who exhibits
      interesting stereopticon pictures and then knocks the interest all out of
      them with his comments upon them. But all the world go there to look and
      listen, and are apparently well satisfied. And they ought to be fully
      satisfied, if the lecturer would only keep still, or die in the first act.
      But he described how retired tradesmen and farmers in Holland load a lazy
      scow with the family and the household effects, and then loaf along the
      waterways of the low countries all the summer long, paying no visits,
      receiving none, and just lazying a heavenly life out in their own private
      unpestered society, and doing their literary work, if they have any,
      wholly uninterrupted. If you had hired such a boat and sent for us we
      should have a couple of satisfactory books ready for the press now with no
      marks of interruption, vexatious wearinesses, and other hellishnesses
      visible upon them anywhere. We shall have to do this another time. We have
      lost an opportunity for the present. Do you forget that Heaven is packed
      with a multitude of all nations and that these people are all on the most
      familiar how-the-hell-are-you footing with Talmage swinging around the
      circle to all eternity hugging the saints and patriarchs and archangels,
      and forcing you to do the same unless you choose to make yourself an
      object of remark if you refrain? Then why do you try to get to Heaven? Be
      warned in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have all read your two opening numbers in the Century, and consider
      them almost beyond praise. I hear no dissent from this verdict. I did not
      know there was an untouched personage in American life, but I had
      forgotten the auctioneer. You have photographed him accurately.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been an utterly free person for a month or two; and I do not
      believe I ever so greatly appreciated and enjoyed&mdash;and realized the
      absence of the chains of slavery as I do this time. Usually my first
      waking thought in the morning is, &ldquo;I have nothing to do to-day, I
      belong to nobody, I have ceased from being a slave.&rdquo; Of course the
      highest pleasure to be got out of freedom, and having nothing to do, is
      labor. Therefore I labor. But I take my time about it. I work one hour or
      four as happens to suit my mind, and quit when I please. And so these days
      are days of entire enjoyment. I told Clark the other day, to jog along
      comfortable and not get in a sweat. I said I believed you would not be
      able to enjoy editing that library over there, where you have your own
      legitimate work to do and be pestered to death by society besides;
      therefore I thought if he got it ready for you against your return, that
      that would be best and pleasantest.
    </p>
    <p>
      You remember Governor Jewell, and the night he told about Russia, down in
      the library. He was taken with a cold about three weeks ago, and I stepped
      over one evening, proposing to beguile an idle hour for him with a yarn or
      two, but was received at the door with whispers, and the information that
      he was dying. His case had been dangerous during that day only and he died
      that night, two hours after I left. His taking off was a prodigious
      surprise, and his death has been most widely and sincerely regretted. Win.
      E. Dodge, the father-in-law of one of Jewell&rsquo;s daughters, dropped
      suddenly dead the day before Jewell died, but Jewell died without knowing
      that. Jewell&rsquo;s widow went down to New York, to Dodge&rsquo;s house,
      the day after Jewell&rsquo;s funeral, and was to return here day before
      yesterday, and she did&mdash;in a coffin. She fell dead, of heart disease,
      while her trunks were being packed for her return home. Florence Strong,
      one of Jewell&rsquo;s daughters, who lives in Detroit, started East on an
      urgent telegram, but missed a connection somewhere, and did not arrive
      here in time to see her father alive. She was his favorite child, and they
      had always been like lovers together. He always sent her a box of fresh
      flowers once a week to the day of his death; a custom which he never
      suspended even when he was in Russia. Mrs. Strong had only just reached
      her Western home again when she was summoned to Hartford to attend her
      mother&rsquo;s funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have had the impulse to write you several times. I shall try to remember
      better henceforth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With sincerest regards to all of you,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                                   Yours as ever,
                                             MARK.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Mark Twain made another trip to Canada in the interest of copyright
     &mdash;this time to protect the Mississippi book.  When his journey was
     announced by the press, the Marquis of Lorne telegraphed an
     invitation inviting him to be his guest at Rideau Hall, in Ottawa.
     Clemens accepted, of course, and was handsomely entertained by the
     daughter of Queen Victoria and her husband, then Governor-General of
     Canada.

     On his return to Hartford he found that Osgood had issued a curious
     little book, for which Clemens had prepared an introduction.  It was
     an absurd volume, though originally issued with serious intent, its
     title being The New Guide of the Conversation in Portuguese and
     English.&rsquo;&mdash;[The New Guide of the Conversation in Portuguese and
     English, by Pedro Caxolino, with an introduction by Mark Twain.
     Osgood, Boston, 1883. ]&mdash;Evidently the &ldquo;New Guide&rdquo; was prepared by
     some simple Portuguese soul with but slight knowledge of English
     beyond that which could be obtained from a dictionary, and his
     literal translation of English idioms are often startling, as, for
     instance, this one, taken at random:

     &ldquo;A little learneds are happies enough for to may to satisfy their
     fancies on the literature.&rdquo;

     Mark Twain thought this quaint book might amuse his royal hostess,
     and forwarded a copy in what he considered to be the safe and proper
     form.

</pre>
    <p>
      DEAR COLONEL DE WINTON,&mdash;I very much want to send a little book to
      her Royal Highness&mdash;the famous Portuguese phrase book; but I do not
      know the etiquette of the matter, and I would not wittingly infringe any
      rule of propriety. It is a book which I perfectly well know will amuse her
      &ldquo;some at most&rdquo; if she has not seen it before, and will still
      amuse her &ldquo;some at least,&rdquo; even if she has inspected it a
      hundred times already. So I will send the book to you, and you who know
      all about the proper observances will protect me from indiscretion, in
      case of need, by putting the said book in the fire, and remaining as dumb
      as I generally was when I was up there. I do not rebind the thing, because
      that would look as if I thought it worth keeping, whereas it is only worth
      glancing at and casting aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will you please present my compliments to Mrs. De Winton and Mrs.
      Mackenzie?&mdash;and I beg to make my sincere compliments to you, also,
      for your infinite kindnesses to me. I did have a delightful time up there,
      most certainly.

      now issued. A good long delay.

     Howells, writing from Venice, in April, manifested special interest
     in the play project: &ldquo;Something that would run like Scheherazade,
     for a thousand and one nights,&rdquo; so perhaps his book was going
     better.  He proposed that they devote the month of October to the
     work, and inclosed a letter from Mallory, who owned not only a
     religious paper, The Churchman, but also the Madison Square Theater,
     and was anxious for a Howells play.  Twenty years before Howells had
     been Consul to Venice, and he wrote, now: &ldquo;The idea of my being here
     is benumbing and silencing.  I feel like the Wandering Jew, or the
     ghost of the Cardiff giant.&rdquo;

     He returned to America in July.  Clemens sent him word of welcome,
     with glowing reports of his own undertakings.  The story on which he
     was piling up MS. was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, begun
     seven years before at Quarry Farm.  He had no great faith in it
     then, and though he had taken it up again in 1880, his interest had
     not lasted to its conclusion.  This time, however, he was in the
     proper spirit, and the story would be finished.

      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;We are desperately glad you and your gang are home
      again&mdash;may you never travel again, till you go aloft or alow. Charley
      Clark has gone to the other side for a run&mdash;will be back in August.
      He has been sick, and needed the trip very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Clemens had a long and wasting spell of sickness last Spring, but she
      is pulling up, now. The children are booming, and my health is ridiculous,
      it&rsquo;s so robust, notwithstanding the newspaper misreports.
    </p>
    <p>
      I haven&rsquo;t piled up MS so in years as I have done since we came here
      to the farm three weeks and a half ago. Why, it&rsquo;s like old times, to
      step right into the study, damp from the breakfast table, and sail right
      in and sail right on, the whole day long, without thought of running short
      of stuff or words.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote 4000 words to-day and I touch 3000 and upwards pretty often, and
      don&rsquo;t fall below 1600 any working day. And when I get fagged out, I
      lie abed a couple of days and read and smoke, and then go it again for 6
      or 7 days. I have finished one small book, and am away along in a big 433
      one that I half-finished two or three years ago. I expect to complete it
      in a month or six weeks or two months more. And I shall like it, whether
      anybody else does or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      It&rsquo;s a kind of companion to Tom Sawyer. There&rsquo;s a raft episode
      from it in second or third chapter of life on the Mississippi.....
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m booming, these days&mdash;got health and spirits to waste&mdash;got
      an overplus; and if I were at home, we would write a play. But we must do
      it anyhow by and by.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stay here till Sep. 10; then maybe a week at Indian Neck for sea air,
      then home.

      We are powerful glad you are all back; and send love according.

    <p>
      DEAR MA AND ORION AND MOLLIE,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know that I have
      anything new to report, except that Livy is still gaining, and all the
      rest of us flourishing. I haven&rsquo;t had such booming working-days for
      many years. I am piling up manuscript in a really astonishing way. I
      believe I shall complete, in two months, a book which I have been fooling
      over for 7 years. This summer it is no more trouble to me to write than it
      is to lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day before yesterday I felt slightly warned to knock off work for one day.
      So I did it, and took the open air. Then I struck an idea for the
      instruction of the children, and went to work and carried it out. It took
      me all day. I measured off 817 feet of the road-way in our farm grounds,
      with a foot-rule, and then divided it up among the English reigns, from
      the Conqueror down to 1883, allowing one foot to the year. I whittled out
      a basket of little pegs and drove one in the ground at the beginning of
      each reign, and gave it that King&rsquo;s name&mdash;thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      I measured all the reigns exactly as many feet to the reign as there were
      years in it. You can look out over the grounds and see the little pegs
      from the front door&mdash;some of them close together, like Richard II,
      Richard Cromwell, James II, &amp;c., and some prodigiously wide apart,
      like Henry III, Edward III, George III, &amp;c. It gives the children a
      realizing sense of the length or brevity of a reign. Shall invent a
      violent game to go with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in bed, last night, I invented a way to play it indoors&mdash;in a far
      more voluminous way, as to multiplicity of dates and events&mdash;on a
      cribbage board.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Hello, supper&rsquo;s ready.
          Love to all.
                    Good bye.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Onion Clemens would naturally get excited over the idea of the game
     and its commercial possibilities.  Not more so than his brother,
     however, who presently employed him to arrange a quantity of
     historical data which the game was to teach.  For a season, indeed,
     interest in the game became a sort of midsummer madness which
     pervaded the two households, at Keokuk and at Quarry Farm.  Howells
     wrote his approval of the idea of &ldquo;learning history by the running
     foot,&rdquo; which was a pun, even if unintentional, for in its out-door
     form it was a game of speed as well as knowledge.

     Howells adds that he has noticed that the newspapers are exploiting
     Mark Twain&rsquo;s new invention of a history game, and we shall presently
     see how this happened.

     Also, in this letter, Howells speaks of an English nobleman to whom
     he has given a letter of introduction.  &ldquo;He seemed a simple, quiet,
     gentlemanly man, with a good taste in literature, which he evinced
     by going about with my books in his pockets, and talking of yours.&rdquo;

      To W. D. Howells, in Boston:
    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;How odd it seems, to sit down to write a letter
      with the feeling that you&rsquo;ve got time to do it. But I&rsquo;m done
      work, for this season, and so have got time. I&rsquo;ve done two seasons&rsquo;
      work in one, and haven&rsquo;t anything left to do, now, but revise. I&rsquo;ve
      written eight or nine hundred MS pages in such a brief space of time that
      I mustn&rsquo;t name the number of days; I shouldn&rsquo;t believe it
      myself, and of course couldn&rsquo;t expect you to. I used to restrict
      myself to 4 or 5 hours a day and 5 days in the week, but this time I&rsquo;ve
      wrought from breakfast till 5.15 p.m. six days in the week; and once or
      twice I smouched a Sunday when the boss wasn&rsquo;t looking. Nothing is
      half so good as literature hooked on Sunday, on the sly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote you and Twichell on the same night, about the game, and was
      appalled to get a note from him saying he was going to print part of my
      letter, and was going to do it before I could get a chance to forbid it. I
      telegraphed him, but was of course too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you haven&rsquo;t ever tried to invent an indoor historical game, don&rsquo;t.
      I&rsquo;ve got the thing at last so it will work, I guess, but I don&rsquo;t
      want any more tasks of that kind. When I wrote you, I thought I had it;
      whereas I was only merely entering upon the initiatory difficulties of it.
      I might have known it wouldn&rsquo;t be an easy job, or somebody would
      have invented a decent historical game long ago&mdash;a thing which nobody
      had done. I think I&rsquo;ve got it in pretty fair shape&mdash;so I have
      caveated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earl of Onston&mdash;is that it? All right, we shall be very glad to
      receive them and get acquainted with them. And much obliged to you, too.
      There&rsquo;s plenty of worse people than the nobilities. I went up and
      spent a week with the Marquis and the Princess Louise, and had as good a
      time as I want.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m powerful glad you are all back again; and we will come up there
      if our little tribe will give us the necessary furlough; and if we can&rsquo;t
      get it, you folks must come to us and give us an extension of time. We get
      home Sept. 11.

      a woman thinks you can. I better seal this, now&mdash;else there&rsquo;ll
      be more criticism.
    </p>

      of all the family to all the Howellses.

     There had been some delay and postponement in the matter of
     the play which Howells and Clemens agreed to write.  They
     did not put in the entire month of October as they had
     planned, but they did put in a portion of that month, the
     latter half, working out their old idea. In the end it
     became a revival of Colonel Sellers, or rather a caricature
     of that gentle hearted old visionary.  Clemens had always
     complained that the actor Raymond had never brought out the
     finer shades of Colonel Sellers&rsquo;s character, but Raymond in
     his worst performance never belied his original as did
     Howells and Clemens in his dramatic revival.  These two,
     working together, let their imaginations run riot with
     disastrous results.  The reader can judge something of this
     himself, from The American Claimant the book which Mark
     Twain would later build from the play.

     But at this time they thought it a great triumph.  They had
     &ldquo;cracked their sides&rdquo; laughing over its construction, as
     Howells once said, and they thought the world would do the
     same over its performance.  They decided to offer it to
     Raymond, but rather haughtily, indifferently, because any
     number of other actors would be waiting for it.

     But this was a miscalculation.  Raymond now turned the
     tables.  Though favorable to the idea of a new play, he
     declared this one did not present his old Sellers at all,
     but a lunatic.  In the end he returned the MS. with a brief
     note.  Attempts had already been made to interest other
     actors, and  would continue for some time.

     Mark Twain had a lingering attack of the dramatic fever that
     winter. He made a play of the Prince and Pauper, which
     Howells pronounced &ldquo;too thin and slight and not half long
     enough.&rdquo;  He made another of Tom Sawyer, and probably
     destroyed it, for no trace of the MS. exists to-day. Howells
     could not join in these ventures, for he was otherwise

      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;&ldquo;O my goodn&rsquo;s&rdquo;, as Jean says. You
      have now encountered at last the heaviest calamity that can befall an
      author. The scarlet fever, once domesticated, is a permanent member of the
      family. Money may desert you, friends forsake you, enemies grow
      indifferent to you, but the scarlet fever will be true to you, through
      thick and thin, till you be all saved or damned, down to the last one. I
      say these things to cheer you.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bare suggestion of scarlet fever in the family makes me shudder; I
      believe I would almost rather have Osgood publish a book for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      You folks have our most sincere sympathy. Oh, the intrusion of this
      hideous disease is an unspeakable disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      My billiard table is stacked up with books relating to the Sandwich
      Islands: the walls axe upholstered with scraps of paper penciled with
      notes drawn from them. I have saturated myself with knowledge of that
      unimaginably beautiful land and that most strange and fascinating people.
      And I have begun a story. Its hidden motive will illustrate a but-little
      considered fact in human nature; that the religious folly you are born in
      you will die in, no matter what apparently reasonabler religious folly may
      seem to have taken its place meanwhile, and abolished and obliterated it.
      I start Bill Ragsdale at 12 years of age, and the heroine at 4, in the
      midst of the ancient idolatrous system, with its picturesque and amazing
      customs and superstitions, 3 months before the arrival of the missionaries
      and the erection of a shallow Christianity upon the ruins of the old
      paganism. Then these two will become educated Christians, and highly
      civilized.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then I will jump 15 years, and do Ragsdale&rsquo;s leper business.
      When we came to dramatize, we can draw a deal of matter from the story,
      all ready to our hand.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     He never finished the Sandwich Islands story which he and Howells
     were to dramatize later.  His head filled up with other projects,
     such as publishing plans, reading-tours, and the like.  The
     type-setting machine does not appear in the letters of this period,
     but it was an important factor, nevertheless.  It was costing
     several thousand dollars a month for construction and becoming
     a heavy drain on Mark Twain&rsquo;s finances.  It was necessary to
     recuperate, and the anxiety for a profitable play, or some other
     adventure that would bring a quick and generous return, grew out
     of this need.

     Clemens had established Charles L. Webster, his nephew by marriage,
     in a New York office, as selling agent for the Mississippi book and
     for his plays.  He was also planning to let Webster publish the new
     book, Huck Finn.

     George W. Cable had proven his ability as a reader, and Clemens saw
     possibilities in a reading combination, which was first planned to
     include Aldrich, and Howells, and a private car.

     But Aldrich and Howells did not warm to the idea, and the car was
     eliminated from the plan.  Cable came to visit Clemens in Hartford,
     and was taken with the mumps, so that the reading-trip was
     postponed.

     The fortunes of the Sellers play were most uncertain and becoming
     daily more doubtful.  In February, Howells wrote: &ldquo;If you have got
     any comfort in regard to our play I wish you would heave it into my
     bosom.&rdquo;

     Cable recovered in time, and out of gratitude planned a great
     April-fool surprise for his host.  He was a systematic man, and did
     it in his usual thorough way.  He sent a &ldquo;private and confidential&rdquo;
      suggestion to a hundred and fifty of Mark Twain&rsquo;s friends and
     admirers, nearly all distinguished literary men.  The suggestion
     was that each one of them should send a request for Mark Twain&rsquo;s
     autograph, timing it so that it would arrive on the 1st of April.
     All seemed to have responded.  Mark Twain&rsquo;s writing-table on April
     Fool morning was heaped with letters, asking in every ridiculous
     fashion for his &ldquo;valuable autograph.&rdquo;  The one from Aldrich was a
     fair sample.  He wrote: &ldquo;I am making a collection of autographs of
     our distinguished writers, and having read one of your works,
     Gabriel Convoy, I would like to add your name to the list.&rdquo;

     Of course, the joke in this was that Gabriel Convoy was by Bret
     Harte, who by this time was thoroughly detested by Mark Twain.  The
     first one or two of the letters puzzled the victim; then he
     comprehended the size and character of the joke and entered into it
     thoroughly.  One of the letters was from Bloodgood H. Cutter, the
     &ldquo;Poet Lariat&rdquo; of Innocents Abroad.  Cutter, of course, wrote in
     &ldquo;poetry,&rdquo; that is to say, doggerel.  Mark Twain&rsquo;s April Fool was a
     most pleasant one.

    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS, It took my breath away, and I haven&rsquo;t recovered it
      yet, entirely&mdash;I mean the generosity of your proposal to read the
      proofs of Huck Finn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now if you mean it, old man&mdash;if you are in earnest&mdash;proceed, in
      God&rsquo;s name, and be by me forever blest. I cannot conceive of a
      rational man deliberately piling such an atrocious job upon himself; but
      if there is such a man and you be that man, why then pile it on. It will
      cost me a pang every time I think of it, but this anguish will be
      eingebusst to me in the joy and comfort I shall get out of the not having
      to read the verfluchtete proofs myself. But if you have repented of your
      augenblichlicher Tobsucht and got back to calm cold reason again, I won&rsquo;t
      hold you to it unless I find I have got you down in writing somewhere.
      Herr, I would not read the proof of one of my books for any fair and
      reasonable sum whatever, if I could get out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof-reading on the P &amp; P cost me the last rags of my religion.

     Howells had written that he would be glad to help out in the
     reading of the proofs of Huck Finn, which book Webster by
     this time had in hand. Replying to Clemens&rsquo;s eager and
     grateful acceptance now, he wrote: &ldquo;It is all perfectly true
     about the generosity, unless I am going to read your proofs
     from one of the shabby motives which I always find at the
     bottom of my soul if I examine it.&rdquo;  A characteristic
     utterance, though we may be permitted to believe that his
     shabby motives were fewer and less shabby than those of
     mankind in general.

     The proofs which Howells was reading pleased him mightily.
     Once, during the summer, he wrote: &ldquo;if I had written half as
     good a book as Huck Finn I shouldn&rsquo;t ask anything better
     than to read the proofs; even as it is, I don&rsquo;t, so send
     them on; they will always find me somewhere.&rdquo;

     This was the summer of the Blaine-Cleveland campaign.  Mark
     Twain, in company with many other leading men, had
     mugwumped, and was supporting Cleveland.  From the next
     letter we gather something of the aspects of that memorable
     campaign, which was one of scandal and vituperation.  We
     learn, too, that the young sculptor, Karl Gerhardt, having
     completed a three years&rsquo; study in Paris, had returned to
     America a qualified artist.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;This presidential campaign is too delicious for
      anything. Isn&rsquo;t human nature the most consummate sham and lie that
      was ever invented? Isn&rsquo;t man a creature to be ashamed of in pretty
      much all his aspects? Man, &ldquo;know thyself &ldquo;&mdash;and then thou
      wilt despise thyself, to a dead moral certainty. Take three quite good
      specimens&mdash;Hawley, Warner, and Charley Clark. Even I do not loathe
      Blaine more than they do; yet Hawley is howling for Blaine, Warner and
      Clark are eating their daily crow in the paper for him, and all three will
      vote for him. O Stultification, where is thy sting, O slave where is thy
      hickory!
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose you heard how a marble monument for which St. Gaudens was
      pecuniarily responsible, burned down in Hartford the other day, uninsured&mdash;for
      who in the world would ever think of insuring a marble shaft in a cemetery
      against a fire?&mdash;and left St. Gauden out of pocket $15,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bad day for artists. Gerhardt finished my bust that day, and the
      work was pronounced admirable by all the kin and friends; but in putting
      it in plaster (or rather taking it out) next day it got ruined. It was
      four or five weeks hard work gone to the dogs. The news flew, and
      everybody on the farm flocked to the arbor and grouped themselves about
      the wreck in a profound and moving silence&mdash;the farm-help, the
      colored servants, the German nurse, the children, everybody&mdash;a
      silence interrupted at wide intervals by absent-minded ejaculations wising
      from unconscious breasts as the whole size of the disaster gradually
      worked its way home to the realization of one spirit after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some burst out with one thing, some another; the German nurse put up her
      hands and said, &ldquo;Oh, Schade! oh, schrecklich!&rdquo; But Gerhardt
      said nothing; or almost that. He couldn&rsquo;t word it, I suppose. But he
      went to work, and by dark had everything thoroughly well under way for a
      fresh start in the morning; and in three days&rsquo; time had built a new
      bust which was a trifle better than the old one&mdash;and to-morrow we
      shall put the finishing touches on it, and it will be about as good a one
      as nearly anybody can make.
    </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      If you run across anybody who wants a bust, be sure and recommend Gerhardt
      on my say-so.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     But Howells was determinedly for Blaine.  &ldquo;I shall vote for
     Blaine,&rdquo; he replied.  &ldquo;I do not believe he is guilty of the
     things they accuse him of, and I know they are not proved
     against him.  As for Cleveland, his private life may be no
     worse than that of most men, but as an enemy of that
     contemptible, hypocritical, lop-sided morality which says a
     woman shall suffer all the shame of unchastity and man none,
     I want to see him destroyed politically by his past.  The
     men who defend him would take their wives to the White House
     if he were president, but if he married his concubine&mdash;&lsquo;made
     her an honest woman&rsquo; they would not go near him.  I can&rsquo;t
     stand that.&rdquo;

     Certainly this was sound logic, in that day, at least.  But
     it left Clemens far from satisfied.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;Somehow I can&rsquo;t seem to rest quiet under the
      idea of your voting for Blaine. I believe you said something about the
      country and the party. Certainly allegiance to these is well; but as
      certainly a man&rsquo;s first duty is to his own conscience and honor&mdash;the
      party or the country come second to that, and never first. I don&rsquo;t
      ask you to vote at all&mdash;I only urge you to not soil yourself by
      voting for Blaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you wrote before, you were able to say the charges against him were
      not proven. But you know now that they are proven, and it seems to me that
      that bars you and all other honest and honorable men (who are
      independently situated) from voting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not necessary to vote for Cleveland; the only necessary thing to do,
      as I understand it, is that a man shall keep himself clean, (by
      withholding his vote for an improper man) even though the party and the
      country go to destruction in consequence. It is not parties that make or
      save countries or that build them to greatness&mdash;it is clean men,
      clean ordinary citizens, rank and file, the masses. Clean masses are not
      made by individuals standing back till the rest become clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I said before, I think a man&rsquo;s first duty is to his own honor;
      not to his country and not to his party. Don&rsquo;t be offended; I mean
      no offence. I am not so concerned about the rest of the nation, but&mdash;well,
      good-bye.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     There does not appear to be any further discussion of the matter
     between Howells and Clemens.  Their letters for a time contained no
     suggestion of politics.

     Perhaps Mark Twain&rsquo;s own political conscience was not entirely clear
     in his repudiation of his party; at least we may believe from his
     next letter that his Cleveland enthusiasm was qualified by a
     willingness to support a Republican who would command his admiration
     and honor.  The idea of an eleventh-hour nomination was rather
     startling, whatever its motive.

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR MR. PIERCE,&mdash;You know, as well as I do, that the reason the
      majority of republicans are going to vote for Blaine is because they feel
      that they cannot help themselves. Do not you believe that if Mr. Edmunds
      would consent to run for President, on the Independent ticket&mdash;even
      at this late day&mdash;he might be elected?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, if he wouldn&rsquo;t consent, but should even strenuously protest
      and say he wouldn&rsquo;t serve if elected, isn&rsquo;t it still wise and
      fair to nominate him and vote for him? since his protest would relieve him
      from all responsibility; and he couldn&rsquo;t surely find fault with
      people for forcing a compliment upon him. And do not you believe that his
      name thus compulsorily placed at the head of the Independent column would
      work absolutely certain defeat to Blain and save the country&rsquo;s
      honor?
    </p>
    <p>
      Politicians often carry a victory by springing some disgraceful and
      rascally mine under the feet of the adversary at the eleventh hour; would
      it not be wholesome to vary this thing for once and spring as formidable a
      mine of a better sort under the enemy&rsquo;s works?
    </p>
    <p>
      If Edmunds&rsquo;s name were put up, I would vote for him in the teeth of
      all the protesting and blaspheming he could do in a month; and there are
      lots of others who would do likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this notion is not a foolish and wicked one, won&rsquo;t you just
      consult with some chief Independents, and see if they won&rsquo;t call a
      sudden convention and whoop the thing through? To nominate Edmunds the 1st
      of November, would be soon enough, wouldn&rsquo;t it?
    </p>

     Clemens and Cable set out on their reading-tour in November.
     They were a curiously-assorted pair: Cable was of orthodox

     was not.  In the beginning Cable undertook to read the Bible
     aloud to Clemens each evening, but this part of the day&rsquo;s
     program was presently omitted by request.  If they spent
     Sunday in a town, Cable was up bright and early visiting the

      XXV. THE GREAT YEAR OF 1885. CLEMENS AND CABLE. PUBLICATION OF &ldquo;HUCK
      FINN.&rdquo; THE GRANT MEMOIRS. MARK TWAIN AT FIFTY.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The year 1885 was in some respects the most important, certainly the
     most pleasantly exciting, in Mark Twain&rsquo;s life.  It was the year in
     which he entered fully into the publishing business and launched one
     of the most spectacular of all publishing adventures, The Personal
     Memoirs of General U. S. Grant.  Clemens had not intended to do
     general publishing when he arranged with Webster to become
     sales-agent for the Mississippi book, and later general agent for
     Huck Finn&rsquo;s adventures; he had intended only to handle his own
     books, because he was pretty thoroughly dissatisfied with other
     publishing arrangements.  Even the Library of Humor, which Howells,
     with Clark, of the Courant, had put together for him, he left with
     Osgood until that publisher failed, during the spring of 1885.
     Certainly he never dreamed of undertaking anything of the
     proportions of the Grant book.

     He had always believed that Grant could make a book.  More than
     once, when they had met, he had urged the General to prepare his
     memoirs for publication.  Howells, in his &lsquo;My Mark Twain&rsquo;, tells of
     going with Clemens to see Grant, then a member of the ill-fated firm
     of Grant and Ward, and how they lunched on beans, bacon and coffee
     brought in from a near-by restaurant.  It was while they were eating
     this soldier fare that Clemens&mdash;very likely abetted by Howells
     &mdash;especially urged the great commander to prepare his memoirs.  But
     Grant had become a financier, as he believed, and the prospect of
     literary earnings, however large, did not appeal to him.
     Furthermore, he was convinced that he was without literary ability
     and that a book by him would prove a failure.

     But then, by and by, came a failure more disastrous than anything he
     had foreseen&mdash;the downfall of his firm through the Napoleonic
     rascality of Ward.  General Grant was utterly ruined; he was left
     without income and apparently without the means of earning one.  It
     was the period when the great War Series was appeasing in the
     Century Magazine.  General Grant, hard-pressed, was induced by the
     editors to prepare one or more articles, and, finding that he could
     write them, became interested in the idea of a book.  It is
     unnecessary to repeat here the story of how the publication of this
     important work passed into the hands of Mark Twain; that is to say,
     the firm of Charles L. Webster &amp; Co., the details having been fully
     given elsewhere.&mdash;[See Mark Twain: A Biography, chap.  cliv.]&mdash;

     We will now return for the moment to other matters, as reported in
     order by the letters.  Clemens and Cable had continued their
     reading-tour into Canada, and in February found themselves in
     Montreal.  Here they were invited by the Toque Bleue Snow-shoe Club
     to join in one of their weekly excursions across Mt. Royal.  They
     could not go, and the reasons given by Mark Twain are not without
     interest.  The letter is to Mr. George Iles, author of Flame,
     Electricity, and the Camera, and many other useful works.

      MY DEAR ILES,&mdash;I got your other telegram a while ago, and answered
      it, explaining that I get only a couple of hours in the middle of the day
      for social life. I know it doesn&rsquo;t seem rational that a man should
      have to lie abed all day in order to be rested and equipped for talking an
      hour at night, and yet in my case and Cable&rsquo;s it is so. Unless I get
      a great deal of rest, a ghastly dulness settles down upon me on the
      platform, and turns my performance into work, and hard work, whereas it
      ought always to be pastime, recreation, solid enjoyment. Usually it is
      just this latter, but that is because I take my rest faithfully, and
      prepare myself to do my duty by my audience.

      is. My cast iron duty is to my audience&mdash;it leaves me no liberty and
      no option.

     In the next letter we reach the end of the Clemens-Cable venture and
     get a characteristic summing up of Mark Twain&rsquo;s general attitude
     toward the companion of his travels.  It must be read only in the
     clear realization of Mark Twain&rsquo;s attitude toward orthodoxy, and his
     habit of humor.  Cable was as rigidly orthodox as Mark Twain was
     revolutionary.  The two were never anything but the best of friends.

     Clemens and Webster were often at the house of General Grant during
     these early days of 1885, and it must have been Webster who was
     present with Clemens on the great occasion described in the
     following telegram.  It was on the last day and hour of President
     Arthur&rsquo;s administration that the bill was passed which placed
     Ulysses S. Grant as full General with full pay on the retired list,
     and it is said that the congressional clock was set back in order
     that this enactment might become a law before the administration
     changed.  General Grant had by this time developed cancer and was
     already in feeble health.

     Something has been mentioned before of Mark Twain&rsquo;s investments and
     the generally unprofitable habit of them.  He had a trusting nature,
     and was usually willing to invest money on any plausible

     recommended by a Hartford banker and advertised in a religious
     paper.  He added, &ldquo;After I made that purchase they wrote me that you
     had just bought a hundred shares and that you were a &lsquo;shrewd&rsquo; man.&rdquo;

      MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I take my earliest opportunity to answer your favor of
      Feb. B&mdash;&mdash; was premature in calling me a &ldquo;shrewd man.&rdquo;
      I wasn&rsquo;t one at that time, but am one now&mdash;that is, I am at
      least too shrewd to ever again invest in anything put on the market by B&mdash;&mdash;.
      I know nothing whatever about the Bank Note Co., and never did know
      anything about it. B&mdash;&mdash; sold me about $4,000 or $5,000 worth of
      the stock at $110, and I own it yet. He sold me $10,000 worth of another
      rose-tinted stock about the same time. I have got that yet, also. I judge
      that a peculiarity of B&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s stocks is that they are of
      the staying kind. I think you should have asked somebody else whether I
      was a shrewd man or not for two reasons: the stock was advertised in a
      religious paper, a circumstance which was very suspicious; and the
      compliment came to you from a man who was interested to make a purchaser
      of you. I am afraid you deserve your loss. A financial scheme advertised
      in any religious paper is a thing which any living person ought to know
      enough to avoid; and when the factor is added that M. runs that religious
      paper, a dead person ought to know enough to avoid it.

     The story of Huck Finn was having a wide success.  Webster handled
     it skillfully, and the sales were large.  In almost every quarter
     its welcome was enthusiastic.  Here and there, however, could be
     found an exception; Huck&rsquo;s morals were not always approved of by
     library reading-committees.  The first instance of this kind was
     reported from Concord; and would seem not to have depressed the
     author-publisher.

     Perhaps the Concord Free Trade Club had some idea of making amends
     to Mark Twain for the slight put upon his book by their librarians,
     for immediately after the Huck Finn incident they notified him of
     his election to honorary membership.

     Those were the days of &ldquo;authors&rsquo; readings,&rdquo; and Clemens and Howells
     not infrequently assisted at these functions, usually given as
     benefits of one kind or another.  From the next letter, written
     following an entertainment given for the Longfellow memorial, we
     gather that Mark Twain&rsquo;s opinion of Howells&rsquo;s reading was steadily
     improving.

      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;.... Who taught you to read? Observation and
      thought, I guess. And practice at the Tavern Club?&mdash;yes; and that was
      the best teaching of all:
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you sent even your daintiest and most delicate and fleeting points
      home to that audience&mdash;absolute proof of good reading. But you couldn&rsquo;t
      read worth a damn a few years ago. I do not say this to flatter. It is

      Alas, Osgood has failed at last. It was easy to see that he was on the

      To save it from any possibility of getting mixed up in the failure,

</pre>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;You are really my only author; I am restricted to
      you, I wouldn&rsquo;t give a damn for the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bored through Middlemarch during the past week, with its labored and
      tedious analyses of feelings and motives, its paltry and tiresome people,
      its unexciting and uninteresting story, and its frequent blinding flashes
      of single-sentence poetry, philosophy, wit, and what not, and nearly died
      from the overwork. I wouldn&rsquo;t read another of those books for a
      farm. I did try to read one other&mdash;Daniel Deronda. I dragged through
      three chapters, losing flesh all the time, and then was honest enough to
      quit, and confess to myself that I haven&rsquo;t any romance literature
      appetite, as far as I can see, except for your books.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what I started to say, was, that I have just read Part II of Indian
      Summer, and to my mind there isn&rsquo;t a waste line in it, or one that
      could be improved. I read it yesterday, ending with that opinion; and read
      it again to-day, ending with the same opinion emphasized. I haven&rsquo;t
      read Part I yet, because that number must have reached Hartford after we
      left; but we are going to send down town for a copy, and when it comes I
      am to read both parts aloud to the family. It is a beautiful story, and
      makes a body laugh all the time, and cry inside, and feel so old and so
      forlorn; and gives him gracious glimpses of his lost youth that fill him
      with a measureless regret, and build up in him a cloudy sense of his
      having been a prince, once, in some enchanted far-off land, and of being
      an exile now, and desolate&mdash;and Lord, no chance ever to get back
      there again! That is the thing that hurts. Well, you have done it with
      marvelous facility and you make all the motives and feelings perfectly
      clear without analyzing the guts out of them, the way George Eliot does. I
      can&rsquo;t stand George Eliot and Hawthorne and those people; I see what
      they are at a hundred years before they get to it and they just tire me to
      death. And as for &ldquo;The Bostonians,&rdquo; I would rather be damned
      to John Bunyan&rsquo;s heaven than read that.

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     It is as easy to understand Mark Twain&rsquo;s enjoyment of Indian Summer
     as his revolt against Daniel Deronda and The Bostonians.  He cared
     little for writing that did not convey its purpose in the simplest
     and most direct terms.  It is interesting to note that in thanking
     Clemens for his compliment Howells wrote: &ldquo;What people cannot see is
     that I analyze as little as possible; they go on talking about the
     analytical school, which I am supposed to belong to, and I want to
     thank you for using your eyes.....  Did you ever read De Foe&rsquo;s
     &lsquo;Roxana&rsquo;?  If not, then read it, not merely for some of the deepest
     insights into the lying, suffering, sinning, well-meaning human
     soul, but for the best and most natural English that a book was ever
     written in.&rdquo;

     General Grant worked steadily on his book, dictating when he could,
     making brief notes on slips of paper when he could no longer speak.
     Clemens visited him at Mt. McGregor and brought the dying soldier
     the comforting news that enough of his books were already sold to
     provide generously for his family, and that the sales would
     aggregate at least twice as much by the end of the year.

     This was some time in July.  On the 23d of that month General Grant
     died.  Immediately there was a newspaper discussion as to the most
     suitable place for the great chieftain to lie.  Mark Twain&rsquo;s
     contribution to this debate, though in the form of an open letter,
     seems worthy of preservation here.

      Tomb:
    </p>
    <p>
      To THE EDITOR OP&rsquo; THE SUN:&mdash;SIR,&mdash;The newspaper atmosphere
      is charged with objections to New York as a place of sepulchre for General
      Grant, and the objectors are strenuous that Washington is the right place.
      They offer good reasons&mdash;good temporary reasons&mdash;for both of
      these positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it seems to me that temporary reasons are not mete for the occasion.
      We need to consider posterity rather than our own generation. We should
      select a grave which will not merely be in the right place now, but will
      still be in the right place 500 years from now.
    </p>
    <p>
      How does Washington promise as to that? You have only to hit it in one
      place to kill it. Some day the west will be numerically strong enough to
      move the seat of government; her past attempts are a fair warning that
      when the day comes she will do it. Then the city of Washington will lose
      its consequence and pass out of the public view and public talk. It is
      quite within the possibilities that, a century hence, people would wonder
      and say, &ldquo;How did your predecessors come to bury their great dead in
      this deserted place?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But as long as American civilisation lasts New York will last. I cannot
      but think she has been well and wisely chosen as the guardian of a grave
      which is destined to become almost the most conspicuous in the world&rsquo;s
      history. Twenty centuries from now New York will still be New York, still
      a vast city, and the most notable object in it will still be the tomb and
      monument of General Grant.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
I observe that the common and strongest objection to New York is that
she is not &ldquo;national ground.&rdquo; Let us give ourselves no uneasiness about
that. Wherever General Grant&rsquo;s body lies, that is national ground.

     The letter that follows is very long, but it seems too important and
     too interesting to be omitted in any part.  General Grant&rsquo;s early
     indulgence in liquors had long been a matter of wide, though not
     very definite, knowledge.  Every one had heard how Lincoln, on being
     told that Grant drank, remarked something to the effect that he
     would like to know what kind of whisky Grant used so that he might
     get some of it for his other generals.  Henry Ward Beecher, selected
     to deliver a eulogy on the dead soldier, and doubtless wishing
     neither to ignore the matter nor to make too much of it, naturally
     turned for information to the publisher of Grant&rsquo;s own memoirs,
     hoping from an advance copy to obtain light.

      MY DEAR MR. BEECHER,&mdash;My nephew Webster is in Europe making contracts
      for the Memoirs. Before he sailed he came to me with a writing, directed
      to the printers and binders, to this effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honor no order for a sight or copy of the Memoirs while I am
      absent, even though it be signed by Mr. Clemens himself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I gave my permission. There were weighty reasons why I should not only
      give my permission, but hold it a matter of honor to not dissolve the
      order or modify it at any time. So I did all of that&mdash;said the order
      should stand undisturbed to the end. If a principal could dissolve his
      promise as innocently as he can dissolve his written order unguarded by
      his promise, I would send you a copy of the Memoirs instantly. I did not
      foresee you, or I would have made an exception.

    <p>
      My idea gained from army men, is that the drunkenness (and sometimes
      pretty reckless spreeing, nights,) ceased before he came East to be Lt.
      General. (Refer especially to Gen. Wm. B. Franklin&mdash;[If you could see
      Franklin and talk with him&mdash;then he would unbosom,]) It was while
      Grant was still in the West that Mr. Lincoln said he wished he could find
      out what brand of whisky that fellow used, so he could furnish it to some
      of the other generals. Franklin saw Grant tumble from his horse drunk,
      while reviewing troops in New Orleans. The fall gave him a good deal of a
      hurt. He was then on the point of leaving for the Chattanooga region. I
      naturally put &ldquo;that and that together&rdquo; when I read Gen. O. O.
      Howards&rsquo;s article in the Christian Union, three or four weeks ago&mdash;where
      he mentions that the new General arrived lame from a recent accident. (See
      that article.) And why not write Howard?
    </p>
    <p>
      Franklin spoke positively of the frequent spreeing. In camp&mdash;in time
      of war.

      Captain Grant was frequently threatened by the Commandant of his Oregon
      post with a report to the War Department of his conduct unless he modified
      his intemperance. The report would mean dismissal from the service. At
      last the report had to be made out; and then, so greatly was the captain
      beloved, that he was privately informed, and was thus enabled to rush his
      resignation to Washington ahead of the report. Did the report go,
      nevertheless? I don&rsquo;t know. If it did, it is in the War Department
      now, possibly, and seeable. I got all this from a regular army man, but I
      can&rsquo;t name him to save me.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only time General Grant ever mentioned liquor to me was about last
      April or possibly May. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could only build up my strength! The doctors urge whisky and
      champagne; but I can&rsquo;t take them; I can&rsquo;t abide the taste of
      any kind of liquor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he made a conquest so complete that even the taste of liquor was
      become an offense? Or was he so sore over what had been said about his
      habit that he wanted to persuade others and likewise himself that he hadn&rsquo;t
      even ever had any taste for it? It sounded like the latter, but that&rsquo;s
      no evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told me in the fall of &lsquo;84 that there was something the matter
      with his throat, and that at the suggestion of his physicians he had
      reduced his smoking to one cigar a day. Then he added, in a casual
      fashion, that he didn&rsquo;t care for that one, and seldom smoked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could understand that feeling. He had set out to conquer not the habit
      but the inclination&mdash;the desire. He had gone at the root, not the
      trunk. It&rsquo;s the perfect way and the only true way (I speak from
      experience.) How I do hate those enemies of the human race who go around
      enslaving God&rsquo;s free people with pledges&mdash;to quit drinking
      instead of to quit wanting to drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sherman and Van Vliet know everything concerning Grant; and if you
      tell them how you want to use the facts, both of them will testify.
      Regular army men have no concealments about each other; and yet they make
      their awful statements without shade or color or malice with a frankness
      and a child-like naivety, indeed, which is enchanting-and stupefying. West
      Point seems to teach them that, among other priceless things not to be got
      in any other college in this world. If we talked about our guild-mates as
      I have heard Sherman, Grant, Van Vliet and others talk about theirs&mdash;mates
      with whom they were on the best possible terms&mdash;we could never expect
      them to speak to us again.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                  .......................
</pre>
    <p>
      I am reminded, now, of another matter. The day of the funeral I sat an
      hour over a single drink and several cigars with Van Vliet and Sherman and
      Senator Sherman; and among other things Gen. Sherman said, with impatient
      scorn:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea of all this nonsense about Grant not being able to stand
      rude language and indelicate stories! Why Grant was full of humor, and
      full of the appreciation of it. I have sat with him by the hour listening
      to Jim Nye&rsquo;s yarns, and I reckon you know the style of Jim Nye&rsquo;s
      histories, Clemens. It makes me sick&mdash;that newspaper nonsense. Grant
      was no namby-pamby fool, he was a man&mdash;all over&mdash;rounded and
      complete.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I had thought of it! I would have said to General Grant: &ldquo;Put
      the drunkenness in the Memoirs&mdash;and the repentance and reform. Trust
      the people.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But I will wager there is not a hint in the book. He was sore, there. As
      much of the book as I have read gives no hint, as far as I recollect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sick-room brought out the points of Gen. Grant&rsquo;s character&mdash;some
      of them particularly, to wit:
    </p>
    <p>
      His patience; his indestructible equability of temper; his exceeding
      gentleness, kindness, forbearance, lovingness, charity; his loyalty: to
      friends, to convictions, to promises, half-promises, infinitesimal
      fractions and shadows of promises; (There was a requirement of him which I
      considered an atrocity, an injustice, an outrage; I wanted to implore him
      to repudiate it; Fred Grant said, &ldquo;Save your labor, I know him; he
      is in doubt as to whether he made that half-promise or not&mdash;and, he
      will give the thing the benefit of the doubt; he will fulfill that
      half-promise or kill himself trying;&rdquo; Fred Grant was right&mdash;he
      did fulfill it;) his aggravatingly trustful nature; his genuineness,
      simplicity, modesty, diffidence, self-depreciation, poverty in the quality
      of vanity-and, in no contradiction of this last, his simple pleasure in
      the flowers and general ruck sent to him by Tom, Dick and Harry from
      everywhere&mdash;a pleasure that suggested a perennial surprise that he
      should be the object of so much fine attention&mdash;he was the most
      lovable great child in the world; (I mentioned his loyalty: you remember
      Harrison, the colored body-servant? the whole family hated him, but that
      did not make any difference, the General always stood at his back, wouldn&rsquo;t
      allow him to be scolded; always excused his failures and deficiencies with
      the one unvarying formula, &ldquo;We are responsible for these things in
      his race&mdash;it is not fair to visit our fault upon them&mdash;let him
      alone;&rdquo; so they did let him alone, under compulsion, until the great
      heart that was his shield was taken away; then&mdash;well they simply
      couldn&rsquo;t stand him, and so they were excusable for determining to
      discharge him&mdash;a thing which they mortally hated to do, and by lucky
      accident were saved from the necessity of doing;) his toughness as a
      bargainer when doing business for other people or for his country (witness
      his &ldquo;terms&rdquo; at Donelson, Vicksburg, etc.; Fred Grant told me
      his father wound up an estate for the widow and orphans of a friend in St.
      Louis&mdash;it took several years; at the end every complication had been
      straightened out, and the property put upon a prosperous basis; great sums
      had passed through his hands, and when he handed over the papers there
      were vouchers to show what had been done with every penny) and his
      trusting, easy, unexacting fashion when doing business for himself (at
      that same time he was paying out money in driblets to a man who was
      running his farm for him&mdash;and in his first Presidency he paid every
      one of those driblets again (total, $3,000 F. said,) for he hadn&rsquo;t a
      scrap of paper to show that he had ever paid them before; in his dealings
      with me he would not listen to terms which would place my money at risk
      and leave him protected&mdash;the thought plainly gave him pain, and he
      put it from him, waved it off with his hands, as one does accounts of
      crushings and mutilations&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t listen, changed the
      subject;) and his fortitude! He was under, sentence of death last spring;
      he sat thinking, musing, several days&mdash;nobody knows what about; then
      he pulled himself together and set to work to finish that book, a colossal
      task for a dying man. Presently his hand gave out; fate seemed to have got
      him checkmated. Dictation was suggested. No, he never could do that; had
      never tried it; too old to learn, now. By and by&mdash;if he could only do
      Appomattox-well. So he sent for a stenographer, and dictated 9,000 words
      at a single sitting!&mdash;never pausing, never hesitating for a word,
      never repeating&mdash;and in the written-out copy he made hardly a
      correction. He dictated again, every two or three days&mdash;the intervals
      were intervals of exhaustion and slow recuperation&mdash;and at last he
      was able to tell me that he had written more matter than could be got into
      the book. I then enlarged the book&mdash;had to. Then he lost his voice.
      He was not quite done yet, however:&mdash;there was no end of little plums
      and spices to be stuck in, here and there; and this work he patiently
      continued, a few lines a day, with pad and pencil, till far into July, at
      Mt. McGregor. One day he put his pencil aside, and said he was done&mdash;there
      was nothing more to do. If I had been there I could have foretold the
      shock that struck the world three days later.

    <p>
      Well, I&rsquo;ve written all this, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to amount to
      anything. But I do want to help, if I only could. I will enclose some
      scraps from my Autobiography&mdash;scraps about General Grant&mdash;they
      may be of some trifle of use, and they may not&mdash;they at least verify
      known traits of his character. My Autobiography is pretty freely dictated,
      but my idea is to jack-plane it a little before I die, some day or other;
      I mean the rude construction and rotten grammar. It is the only dictating
      I ever did, and it was most troublesome and awkward work. You may return
      it to Hartford.

     The old long-deferred Library of Humor came up again for discussion,
     when in the fall of 1885 Howells associated himself with Harper &amp;
     Brothers.  Howells&rsquo;s contract provided that his name was not to
     appear on any book not published by the Harper firm.  He wrote,
     therefore, offering to sell out his interest in the enterprise for
     two thousand dollars, in addition to the five hundred which he had
     already received&mdash;an amount considered to be less than he was to
     have received as joint author and compiler.  Mark Twain&rsquo;s answer
     pretty fully covers the details of this undertaking.

<pre xml:space="preserve">

    </p>
    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I reckon it would ruin the book that is, make it
      necessary to pigeon-hole it and leave it unpublished. I couldn&rsquo;t
      publish it without a very responsible name to support my own on the title
      page, because it has so much of my own matter in it. I bought Osgood&rsquo;s
      rights for $3,000 cash, I have paid Clark $800 and owe him $700 more,
      which must of course be paid whether I publish or not. Yet I fully
      recognize that I have no sort of moral right to let that ancient and
      procrastinated contract hamper you in any way, and I most certainly won&rsquo;t.
      So, it is my decision,&mdash;after thinking over and rejecting the idea of
      trying to buy permission of the Harpers for $2,500 to use your name, (a
      proposition which they would hate to refuse to a man in a perplexed
      position, and yet would naturally have to refuse it,) to pigeon-hole the
      &ldquo;Library&rdquo;: not destroy it, but merely pigeon-hole it and wait
      a few years and see what new notion Providence will take concerning it. He
      will not desert us now, after putting in four licks to our one on this
      book all this time. It really seems in a sense discourteous not to call it
      &ldquo;Providence&rsquo;s Library of Humor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that deal is all settled, the next question is, do you need and must
      you require that $2,000 now? Since last March, you know, I am carrying a
      mighty load, solitary and alone&mdash;General Grant&rsquo;s book&mdash;and
      must carry it till the first volume is 30 days old (Jan. 1st) before the
      relief money will begin to flow in. From now till the first of January
      every dollar is as valuable to me as it could be to a famishing tramp. If
      you can wait till then&mdash;I mean without discomfort, without
      inconvenience&mdash;it will be a large accommodation to me; but I will not
      allow you to do this favor if it will discommode you. So, speak right out,
      frankly, and if you need the money I will go out on the highway and get
      it, using violence, if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mind, I am not in financial difficulties, and am not going to be. I am
      merely a starving beggar standing outside the door of plenty&mdash;obstructed
      by a Yale time-lock which is set for Jan. 1st. I can stand it, and stand
      it perfectly well; but the days do seem to fool along considerable slower
      than they used to.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am mighty glad you are with the Harpers. I have noticed that good men in
      their employ go there to stay.
    </p>

     In the next letter we begin to get some idea of the size of Mark
     Twain&rsquo;s first publishing venture, and a brief summary of results may
     not be out of place here.

     The Grant Life was issued in two volumes.  In the early months of
     the year when the agents&rsquo; canvass was just beginning, Mark Twain,
     with what seems now almost clairvoyant vision, prophesied a sale of
     three hundred thousand sets.  The actual sales ran somewhat more
     than this number.  On February 27, 1886, Charles L. Webster &amp; Co.
     paid to Mrs. Grant the largest single royalty check in the history
     of book-publishing.  The amount of it was two hundred thousand
     dollars.  Subsequent checks increased the aggregate return to
     considerably more than double this figure.  In a memorandum made by
     Clemens in the midst of the canvass he wrote.

     &ldquo;During 100 consecutive days the sales (i. e., subscriptions) of
     General Grant&rsquo;s book averaged 3,000 sets (6,000 single volumes) per
     day: Roughly stated, Mrs. Grant&rsquo;s income during all that time was
     $5,000 a day.&rdquo;

    <p>
      MY DEAR HOWELLS,&mdash;I told Webster, this afternoon, to send you that
      $2,000; but he is in such a rush, these first days of publication, that he
      may possibly forget it; so I write lest I forget it too. Remind me, if he
      should forget. When I postponed you lately, I did it because I thought I
      should be cramped for money until January, but that has turned out to be
      an error, so I hasten to cut short the postponement.
    </p>
    <p>
      I judge by the newspapers that you are in Auburndale, but I don&rsquo;t
      know it officially.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ve got the first volume launched safely; consequently, half of the
      suspense is over, and I am that much nearer the goal. We&rsquo;ve bound
      and shipped 200,000 books; and by the 10th shall finish and ship the
      remaining 125,000 of the first edition. I got nervous and came down to
      help hump-up the binderies; and I mean to stay here pretty much all the
      time till the first days of March, when the second volume will issue. Shan&rsquo;t
      have so much trouble, this time, though, if we get to press pretty soon,
      because we can get more binderies then than are to be had in front of the
      holidays. One lives and learns. I find it takes 7 binderies four months to
      bind 325,000 books.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a good book to publish. I heard a canvasser say, yesterday, that
      while delivering eleven books he took 7 new subscriptions. But we shall be
      in a hell of a fix if that goes on&mdash;it will &ldquo;ball up&rdquo; the
      binderies again.

     November 30th that year was Mark Twain&rsquo;s fiftieth birthday, an event
     noticed by the newspapers generally, and especially observed by many
     of his friends.  Warner, Stockton and many others sent letters;
     Andrew Lang contributed a fine poem; also Oliver Wendell.  Holmes
     &mdash;the latter by special request of Miss Gilder&mdash;for the Critic.
     These attentions came as a sort of crowning happiness at the end of
     a golden year.  At no time in his life were Mark Twain&rsquo;s fortunes
     and prospects brighter; he had a beautiful family and a perfect
     home. Also, he had great prosperity.  The reading-tour with Cable
     had been a fine success.  His latest book, The Adventures of
     Huckleberry Finn, had added largely to his fame and income.
     The publication of the Grant Memoirs had been a dazzling triumph.
     Mark Twain had become recognized, not only as America&rsquo;s most
     distinguished author, but as its most envied publisher.  And now,
     with his fiftieth birthday, had come this laurel from Holmes, last
     of the Brahmins, to add a touch of glory to all the rest.  We feel
     his exaltation in his note of acknowledgment.

      To Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, in Boston:
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR MR. HOLMES,&mdash;I shall never be able to tell you the half of how
      proud you have made me. If I could you would say you were nearly paid for
      the trouble you took. And then the family: If I can convey the electrical
      surprise and gratitude and exaltation of the wife and the children last
      night, when they happened upon that Critic where I had, with artful
      artlessness, spread it open and retired out of view to see what would
      happen&mdash;well, it was great and fine and beautiful to see, and made me
      feel as the victor feels when the shouting hosts march by; and if you also
      could have seen it you would have said the account was squared. For I have
      brought them up in your company, as in the company of a warm and friendly
      and beneficent but far-distant sun; and so, for you to do this thing was
      for the sun to send down out of the skies the miracle of a special ray and
      transfigure me before their faces. I knew what that poem would be to them;
      I knew it would raise me up to remote and shining heights in their eyes,
      to very fellowship with the chambered Nautilus itself, and that from that
      fellowship they could never more dissociate me while they should live; and
      so I made sure to be by when the surprise should come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Dudley Warner is charmed with the poem for its own felicitous
      sake; and so indeed am I, but more because it has drawn the sting of my
      fiftieth year; taken away the pain of it, the grief of it, the somehow
      shame of it, and made me glad and proud it happened.
    </p>

     letters wait until the lines were done.&rdquo;

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
