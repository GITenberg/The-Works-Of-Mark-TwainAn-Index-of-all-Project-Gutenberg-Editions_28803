<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>Scattered here and there through the stacks of unpublished
manuscript which constitute this formidable Autobiography and
Diary of mine, certain chapters will in some distant future be
found which deal with &ldquo;Claimants&rdquo;&mdash;claimants
historically notorious: Satan, Claimant; the Golden Calf,
Claimant; the Veiled Prophet of Khorassan, Claimant; Louis XVII.,
Claimant; William Shakespeare, Claimant; Arthur Orton, Claimant;
Mary Baker G. Eddy, Claimant&mdash;and the rest of them.&nbsp;
Eminent Claimants, successful Claimants, defeated Claimants,
royal Claimants, pleb Claimants, showy Claimants, shabby
Claimants, revered Claimants, despised Claimants, twinkle
starlike here and there and yonder through the mists of history
and legend and tradition&mdash;and oh, all the darling tribe are
clothed in mystery and romance, and we read about them with deep
interest and discuss them with loving sympathy or with rancorous
resentment, according to which side we hitch ourselves to.&nbsp;
It has always been so with the human race.&nbsp; There was never
a Claimant that couldn&rsquo;t get a hearing, nor one that
couldn&rsquo;t accumulate a rapturous following, no matter how
flimsy and apparently unauthentic his claim might be.&nbsp;
Arthur Orton&rsquo;s claim that he was the lost Tichborne baronet
come to life again was as flimsy as Mrs. Eddy&rsquo;s that she
wrote <i>Science and Health</i> from the direct dictation of the
Deity; yet in England near forty years ago Orton had a huge army
of devotees and incorrigible adherents, many of whom remained
stubbornly unconvinced after their fat god had been proven an
impostor and jailed as a perjurer, and to-day Mrs. Eddy&rsquo;s
following is not only immense, but is daily augmenting in numbers
and enthusiasm.&nbsp; Orton had many fine and educated minds
among his adherents, Mrs. Eddy has had the like among hers from
the beginning.&nbsp; Her church is as well equipped in those
particulars as is any other church.&nbsp; Claimants can always
count upon a following, it doesn&rsquo;t matter who they are, nor
what they claim, nor whether they come with documents or
without.&nbsp; It was always so.&nbsp; Down out of the
long-vanished past, across the abyss of the ages, if you listen
you can still hear the believing multitudes shouting for Perkin
Warbeck and Lambert Simnel.</p>
<p>A friend has sent me a new book, from England&mdash;<i>The
Shakespeare Problem Restated</i>&mdash;well restated and closely
reasoned; and my fifty years&rsquo; interest in that
matter&mdash;asleep for the last three years&mdash;is excited
once more.&nbsp; It is an interest which was born of Delia
Bacon&rsquo;s book&mdash;away back in that ancient
day&mdash;1857, or maybe 1856.&nbsp; About a year later my
pilot-master, Bixby, transferred me from his own steamboat to the
<i>Pennsylvania</i>, and placed me under the orders and
instructions of George Ealer&mdash;dead now, these many, many
years.&nbsp; I steered for him a good many months&mdash;as was
the humble duty of the pilot-apprentice: stood a daylight watch
and spun the wheel under the severe superintendence and
correction of the master.&nbsp; He was a prime chess player and
an idolater of Shakespeare.&nbsp; He would play chess with
anybody; even with me, and it cost his official dignity something
to do that.&nbsp; Also&mdash;quite uninvited&mdash;he would read
Shakespeare to me; not just casually, but by the hour, when it
was his watch, and I was steering.&nbsp; He read well, but not
profitably for me, because he constantly injected commands into
the text.&nbsp; That broke it all up, mixed it all up, tangled it
all up&mdash;to that degree, in fact, that if we were in a risky
and difficult piece of river an ignorant person couldn&rsquo;t
have told, sometimes, which observations were Shakespeare&rsquo;s
and which were Ealer&rsquo;s.&nbsp; For instance:</p>
<blockquote><p>What man dare, <i>I</i> dare!</p>
<p>Approach thou <i>what</i> are you laying in the leads for?
what a hell of an idea! like the rugged ease her off a little,
ease her off! rugged Russian bear, the armed rhinoceros or the
<i>there</i> she goes! meet her, meet her! didn&rsquo;t you
<i>know</i> she&rsquo;d smell the reef if you crowded it like
that?&nbsp; Hyrcan tiger; take any shape but that and my firm
nerves she&rsquo;ll be in the <i>woods</i> the first you know!
stop the starboard! come ahead strong on the larboard! back the
starboard! . . . <i>Now</i> then, you&rsquo;re all right; come
ahead on the starboard; straighten up and go &rsquo;long, never
tremble: or be alive again, and dare me to the desert damnation
can&rsquo;t you keep away from that greasy water? pull her down!
snatch her! snatch her baldheaded! with thy sword; if trembling I
inhabit then, lay in the leads!&mdash;no, only the starboard one,
leave the other alone, protest me the baby of a girl.&nbsp; Hence
horrible shadow! eight bells&mdash;that watchman&rsquo;s asleep
again, I reckon, go down and call Brown yourself, unreal mockery,
hence!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He certainly was a good reader, and splendidly thrilling and
stormy and tragic, but it was a damage to me, because I have
never since been able to read Shakespeare in a calm and sane
way.&nbsp; I cannot rid it of his explosive interlardings, they
break in everywhere with their irrelevant &ldquo;What in hell are
you up to <i>now</i>! pull her down! more!
<i>more</i>!&mdash;there now, steady as you go,&rdquo; and the
other disorganizing interruptions that were always leaping from
his mouth.&nbsp; When I read Shakespeare now, I can hear them as
plainly as I did in that long-departed time&mdash;fifty-one years
ago.&nbsp; I never regarded Ealer&rsquo;s readings as
educational.&nbsp; Indeed they were a detriment to me.</p>
<p>His contributions to the text seldom improved it, but barring
that detail he was a good reader, I can say that much for
him.&nbsp; He did not use the book, and did not need to; he knew
his Shakespeare as well as Euclid ever knew his multiplication
table.</p>
<p>Did he have something to say&mdash;this Shakespeare-adoring
Mississippi pilot&mdash;anent Delia Bacon&rsquo;s book?&nbsp;
Yes.&nbsp; And he said it; said it all the time, for
months&mdash;in the morning watch, the middle watch, the dog
watch; and probably kept it going in his sleep.&nbsp; He bought
the literature of the dispute as fast as it appeared, and we
discussed it all through thirteen hundred miles of river four
times traversed in every thirty-five days&mdash;the time required
by that swift boat to achieve two round trips.&nbsp; We
discussed, and discussed, and discussed, and disputed and
disputed and disputed; at any rate he did, and I got in a word
now and then when he slipped a cog and there was a vacancy.&nbsp;
He did his arguing with heat, with energy, with violence; and I
did mine with the reserve and moderation of a subordinate who
does not like to be flung out of a pilot-house that is perched
forty feet above the water.&nbsp; He was fiercely loyal to
Shakespeare and cordially scornful of Bacon and of all the
pretensions of the Baconians.&nbsp; So was I&mdash;at
first.&nbsp; And at first he was glad that that was my
attitude.&nbsp; There were even indications that he admired it;
indications dimmed, it is true, by the distance that lay between
the lofty boss-pilotical altitude and my lowly one, yet
perceptible to me; perceptible, and translatable into a
compliment&mdash;compliment coming down from above the snow-line
and not well thawed in the transit, and not likely to set
anything afire, not even a cub-pilot&rsquo;s self-conceit; still
a detectable compliment, and precious.</p>
<p>Naturally it flattered me into being more loyal to
Shakespeare&mdash;if possible&mdash;than I was before, and more
prejudiced against Bacon&mdash;if possible than I was
before.&nbsp; And so we discussed and discussed, both on the same
side, and were happy.&nbsp; For a while.&nbsp; Only for a
while.&nbsp; Only for a very little while, a very, very, very
little while.&nbsp; Then the atmosphere began to change; began to
cool off.</p>
<p>A brighter person would have seen what the trouble was,
earlier than I did, perhaps, but I saw it early enough for all
practical purposes.&nbsp; You see, he was of an argumentative
disposition.&nbsp; Therefore it took him but a little time to get
tired of arguing with a person who agreed with everything he said
and consequently never furnished him a provocative to flare up
and show what he could do when it came to clear, cold, hard,
rose-cut, hundred-faceted, diamond-flashing reasoning.&nbsp; That
was his name for it.&nbsp; It has been applied since, with
complacency, as many as several times, in the Bacon-Shakespeare
scuffle.&nbsp; On the Shakespeare side.</p>
<p>Then the thing happened which has happened to more persons
than to me when principle and personal interest found themselves
in opposition to each other and a choice had to be made: I let
principle go, and went over to the other side.&nbsp; Not the
entire way, but far enough to answer the requirements of the
case.&nbsp; That is to say, I took this attitude, to wit: I only
<i>believed</i> Bacon wrote Shakespeare, whereas I <i>knew</i>
Shakespeare didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Ealer was satisfied with that,
and the war broke loose.&nbsp; Study, practice, experience in
handling my end of the matter presently enabled me to take my new
position almost seriously; a little bit later, utterly seriously;
a little later still, lovingly, gratefully, devotedly; finally:
fiercely, rabidly, uncompromisingly.&nbsp; After that, I was
welded to my faith, I was theoretically ready to die for it, and
I looked down with compassion not unmixed with scorn, upon
everybody else&rsquo;s faith that didn&rsquo;t tally with
mine.&nbsp; That faith, imposed upon me by self-interest in that
ancient day, remains my faith to-day, and in it I find comfort,
solace, peace, and never-failing joy.&nbsp; You see how curiously
theological it is.&nbsp; The &ldquo;rice Christian&rdquo; of the
Orient goes through the very same steps, when he is after rice
and the missionary is after <i>him</i>; he goes for rice, and
remains to worship.</p>
<p>Ealer did a lot of our &ldquo;reasoning&rdquo;&mdash;not to
say substantially all of it.&nbsp; The slaves of his cult have a
passion for calling it by that large name.&nbsp; We others do not
call our inductions and deductions and reductions by any name at
all.&nbsp; They show for themselves, what they are, and we can
with tranquil confidence leave the world to ennoble them with a
title of its own choosing.</p>
<p>Now and then when Ealer had to stop to cough, I pulled my
induction-talents together and hove the controversial lead
myself: always getting eight feet, eight-and-a-half, often nine,
sometimes even quarter-less-twain&mdash;as <i>I</i> believed; but
always &ldquo;no bottom,&rdquo; as <i>he</i> said.</p>
<p>I got the best of him only once.&nbsp; I prepared
myself.&nbsp; I wrote out a passage from Shakespeare&mdash;it may
have been the very one I quoted a while ago, I don&rsquo;t
remember&mdash;and riddled it with his wild steamboatful
interlardings.&nbsp; When an unrisky opportunity offered, one
lovely summer day, when we had sounded and buoyed a tangled patch
of crossings known as Hell&rsquo;s Half Acre, and were aboard
again and he had sneaked the Pennsylvania triumphantly through it
without once scraping sand, and the <i>A. T. Lacey</i> had
followed in our wake and got stuck, and he was feeling good, I
showed it to him.&nbsp; It amused him.&nbsp; I asked him to fire
it off: read it; read it, I diplomatically added, as only he
could read dramatic poetry.&nbsp; The compliment touched him
where he lived.&nbsp; He did read it; read it with surpassing
fire and spirit; read it as it will never be read again; for
<i>he</i> knew how to put the right music into those thunderous
interlardings and make them seem a part of the text, make them
sound as if they were bursting from Shakespeare&rsquo;s own soul,
each one of them a golden inspiration and not to be left out
without damage to the massed and magnificent whole.</p>
<p>I waited a week, to let the incident fade; waited longer;
waited until he brought up for reasonings and vituperation my pet
position, my pet argument, the one which I was fondest of, the
one which I prized far above all others in my ammunition-wagon,
to wit: that Shakespeare couldn&rsquo;t have written
Shakespeare&rsquo;s works, for the reason that the man who wrote
them was limitlessly familiar with the laws, and the law-courts,
and law-proceedings, and lawyer-talk, and lawyer-ways&mdash;and
if Shakespeare was possessed of the infinitely-divided star-dust
that constituted this vast wealth, how did he get it, and
<i>where</i>, and <i>when</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;From books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From books!&nbsp; That was always the idea.&nbsp; I answered
as my readings of the champions of my side of the great
controversy had taught me to answer: that a man can&rsquo;t
handle glibly and easily and comfortably and successfully the
<i>argot</i> of a trade at which he has not personally
served.&nbsp; He will make mistakes; he will not, and cannot, get
the trade-phrasings precisely and exactly right; and the moment
he departs, by even a shade, from a common trade-form, the reader
who has served that trade will know the writer
<i>hasn&rsquo;t</i>.&nbsp; Ealer would not be convinced; he said
a man could learn how to correctly handle the subtleties and
mysteries and free-masonries of any trade by careful reading and
studying.&nbsp; But when I got him to read again the passage from
Shakespeare with the interlardings, he perceived, himself, that
books couldn&rsquo;t teach a student a bewildering multitude of
pilot-phrases so thoroughly and perfectly that he could talk them
off in book and play or conversation and make no mistake that a
pilot would not immediately discover.&nbsp; It was a triumph for
me.&nbsp; He was silent awhile, and I knew what was happening: he
was losing his temper.&nbsp; And I knew he would presently close
the session with the same old argument that was always his stay
and his support in time of need; the same old argument, the one I
couldn&rsquo;t answer&mdash;because I dasn&rsquo;t: the argument
that I was an ass, and better shut up.&nbsp; He delivered it, and
I obeyed.</p>
<p>Oh, dear, how long ago it was&mdash;how pathetically long
ago!&nbsp; And here am I, old, forsaken, forlorn and alone,
arranging to get that argument out of somebody again.</p>
<p>When a man has a passion for Shakespeare, it goes without
saying that he keeps company with other standard authors.&nbsp;
Ealer always had several high-class books in the pilot-house, and
he read the same ones over and over again, and did not care to
change to newer and fresher ones.&nbsp; He played well on the
flute, and greatly enjoyed hearing himself play.&nbsp; So did
I.&nbsp; He had a notion that a flute would keep its health
better if you took it apart when it was not standing a watch; and
so, when it was not on duty it took its rest, disjointed, on the
compass-shelf under the breast-board.&nbsp; When the
<i>Pennsylvania</i> blew up and became a drifting rack-heap
freighted with wounded and dying poor souls (my young brother
Henry among them), pilot Brown had the watch below, and was
probably asleep and never knew what killed him; but Ealer escaped
unhurt.&nbsp; He and his pilot-house were shot up into the air;
then they fell, and Ealer sank through the ragged cavern where
the hurricane deck and the boiler deck had been, and landed in a
nest of ruins on the main deck, on top of one of the unexploded
boilers, where he lay prone in a fog of scalding and deadly
steam.&nbsp; But not for long.&nbsp; He did not lose his head:
long familiarity with danger had taught him to keep it, in any
and all emergencies.&nbsp; He held his coat-lappels to his nose
with one hand, to keep out the steam, and scrabbled around with
the other till he found the joints of his flute, then he is took
measures to save himself alive, and was successful.&nbsp; I was
not on board.&nbsp; I had been put ashore in New Orleans by
Captain Klinefelter.&nbsp; The reason&mdash;however, I have told
all about it in the book called <i>Old Times on the
Mississippi</i>, and it isn&rsquo;t important anyway, it is so
long ago.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>When I was a Sunday-school scholar something more than sixty
years ago, I became interested in Satan, and wanted to find out
all I could about him.&nbsp; I began to ask questions, but my
class-teacher, Mr. Barclay the stone-mason, was reluctant about
answering them, it seemed to me.&nbsp; I was anxious to be
praised for turning my thoughts to serious subjects when there
wasn&rsquo;t another boy in the village who could be hired to do
such a thing.&nbsp; I was greatly interested in the incident of
Eve and the serpent, and thought Eve&rsquo;s calmness was
perfectly noble.&nbsp; I asked Mr. Barclay if he had ever heard
of another woman who, being approached by a serpent, would not
excuse herself and break for the nearest timber.&nbsp; He did not
answer my question, but rebuked me for inquiring into matters
above my age and comprehension.&nbsp; I will say for Mr. Barclay
that he was willing to tell me the facts of Satan&rsquo;s
history, but he stopped there: he wouldn&rsquo;t allow any
discussion of them.</p>
<p>In the course of time we exhausted the facts.&nbsp; There were
only five or six of them, you could set them all down on a
visiting-card.&nbsp; I was disappointed.&nbsp; I had been
meditating a biography, and was grieved to find that there were
no materials.&nbsp; I said as much, with the tears running
down.&nbsp; Mr. Barclay&rsquo;s sympathy and compassion were
aroused, for he was a most kind and gentle-spirited man, and he
patted me on the head and cheered me up by saying there was a
whole vast ocean of materials!&nbsp; I can still feel the happy
thrill which these blessed words shot through me.</p>
<p>Then he began to bail out that ocean&rsquo;s riches for my
encouragement and joy.&nbsp; Like this: it was
&ldquo;conjectured&rdquo;&mdash;though not established&mdash;that
Satan was originally an angel in heaven; that he fell; that he
rebelled, and brought on a war; that he was defeated, and
banished to perdition.&nbsp; Also, &ldquo;we have reason to
believe&rdquo; that later he did so-and-so; that &ldquo;we are
warranted in supposing&rdquo; that at a subsequent time he
travelled extensively, seeking whom he might devour; that a
couple of centuries afterward, &ldquo;as tradition instructs
us,&rdquo; he took up the cruel trade of tempting people to their
ruin, with vast and fearful results; that by-and-by, &ldquo;as
the probabilities seem to indicate,&rdquo; he may have done
certain things, he might have done certain other things, he must
have done still other things.</p>
<p>And so on and so on.&nbsp; We set down the five known facts by
themselves, on a piece of paper, and numbered it &ldquo;page
1&rdquo;; then on fifteen hundred other pieces of paper we set
down the &ldquo;conjectures,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;suppositions,&rdquo; and &ldquo;maybes,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;perhapses,&rdquo; and &ldquo;doubtlesses,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;rumors,&rdquo; and &ldquo;guesses,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;probabilities,&rdquo; and &ldquo;likelihoods,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;we are permitted to thinks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;we are
warranted in believings,&rdquo; and &ldquo;might have
beens,&rdquo; and &ldquo;could have beens,&rdquo; and &ldquo;must
have beens,&rdquo; and &ldquo;unquestionablys,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;without a shadow of doubts&rdquo;&mdash;and behold!</p>
<p><i>Materials</i>?&nbsp; Why, we had enough to build a
biography of Shakespeare!</p>
<p>Yet he made me put away my pen; he would not let me write the
history of Satan.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because, as he said, he had
suspicions; suspicions that my attitude in this matter was not
reverent; and that a person must be reverent when writing about
the sacred characters.&nbsp; He said any one who spoke flippantly
of Satan would be frowned upon by the religious world and also be
brought to account.</p>
<p>I assured him, in earnest and sincere words, that he had
wholly misconceived my attitude; that I had the highest respect
for Satan, and that my reverence for him equalled, and possibly
even exceeded, that of any member of any church.&nbsp; I said it
wounded me deeply to perceive by his words that he thought I
would make fun of Satan, and deride him, laugh at him, scoff at
him: whereas in truth I had never thought of such a thing, but
had only a warm desire to make fun of those others and laugh at
<i>them</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;What others?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
the Supposers, the Perhapsers, the Might-Have-Beeners, the
Could-Have-Beeners, the Must-Have-Beeners, the
Without-a-Shadow-of-Doubters, the
We-are-Warranted-in-Believingers, and all that funny crop of
solemn architects who have taken a good solid foundation of five
indisputable and unimportant facts and built upon it a
Conjectural Satan thirty miles high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did Mr. Barclay do then?&nbsp; Was he disarmed?&nbsp; Was
he silenced?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; He was shocked.&nbsp; He was so
shocked that he visibly shuddered.&nbsp; He said the Satanic
Traditioners and Perhapsers and Conjecturers were
<i>themselves</i> sacred!&nbsp; As sacred as their work.&nbsp; So
sacred that whoso ventured to mock them or make fun of their
work, could not afterward enter any respectable house, even by
the back door.</p>
<p>How true were his words, and how wise!&nbsp; How fortunate it
would have been for me if I had heeded them.&nbsp; But I was
young, I was but seven years of age, and vain, foolish, and
anxious to attract attention.&nbsp; I wrote the biography, and
have never been in a respectable house since.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>How curious and interesting is the parallel&mdash;as far as
poverty of biographical details is concerned&mdash;between Satan
and Shakespeare.&nbsp; It is wonderful, it is unique, it stands
quite alone, there is nothing resembling it in history, nothing
resembling it in romance, nothing approaching it even in
tradition.&nbsp; How sublime is their position, and how
over-topping, how sky-reaching, how supreme&mdash;the two Great
Unknowns, the two Illustrious Conjecturabilities!&nbsp; They are
the best-known unknown persons that have ever drawn breath upon
the planet.</p>
<p>For the instruction of the ignorant I will make a list, now,
of those details of Shakespeare&rsquo;s history which are
<i>facts</i>&mdash;verified facts, established facts, undisputed
facts.</p>
<h3>FACTS</h3>
<p>He was born on the 23d of April, 1564.</p>
<p>Of good farmer-class parents who could not read, could not
write, could not sign their names.</p>
<p>At Stratford, a small back settlement which in that day was
shabby and unclean, and densely illiterate.&nbsp; Of the nineteen
important men charged with the government of the town, thirteen
had to &ldquo;make their mark&rdquo; in attesting important
documents, because they could not write their names.</p>
<p>Of the first eighteen years of his life <i>nothing</i> is
known.&nbsp; They are a blank.</p>
<p>On the 27th of November (1582) William Shakespeare took out a
license to marry Anne Whateley.</p>
<p>Next day William Shakespeare took out a license to marry Anne
Hathaway.&nbsp; She was eight years his senior.</p>
<p>William Shakespeare married Anne Hathaway.&nbsp; In a
hurry.&nbsp; By grace of a reluctantly-granted dispensation there
was but one publication of the banns.</p>
<p>Within six months the first child was born.</p>
<p>About two (blank) years followed, during which period
<i>nothing at all happened to Shakespeare</i>, so far as anybody
knows.</p>
<p>Then came twins&mdash;1585.&nbsp; February.</p>
<p>Two blank years follow.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;1587&mdash;he makes a ten-year visit to London,
leaving the family behind.</p>
<p>Five blank years follow.&nbsp; During this period <i>nothing
happened to him</i>, as far as anybody actually knows.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;1592&mdash;there is mention of him as an actor.</p>
<p>Next year&mdash;1593&mdash;his name appears in the official
list of players.</p>
<p>Next year&mdash;1594&mdash;he played before the queen.&nbsp; A
detail of no consequence: other obscurities did it every year of
the forty-five of her reign.&nbsp; And remained obscure.</p>
<p>Three pretty full years follow.&nbsp; Full of
play-acting.&nbsp; Then</p>
<p>In 1597 he bought New Place, Stratford.</p>
<p>Thirteen or fourteen busy years follow; years in which he
accumulated money, and also reputation as actor and manager.</p>
<p>Meantime his name, liberally and variously spelt, had become
associated with a number of great plays and poems, as
(ostensibly) author of the same.</p>
<p>Some of these, in these years and later, were pirated, but he
made no protest.&nbsp; Then&mdash;1610-11&mdash;he returned to
Stratford and settled down for good and all, and busied himself
in lending money, trading in tithes, trading in land and houses;
shirking a debt of forty-one shillings, borrowed by his wife
during his long desertion of his family; suing debtors for
shillings and coppers; being sued himself for shillings and
coppers; and acting as confederate to a neighbor who tried to rob
the town of its rights in a certain common, and did not
succeed.</p>
<p>He lived five or six years&mdash;till 1616&mdash;in the joy of
these elevated pursuits.&nbsp; Then he made a will, and signed
each of its three pages with his name.</p>
<p>A thoroughgoing business man&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; It named in
minute detail every item of property he owned in the
world&mdash;houses, lands, sword, silver-gilt bowl, and so
on&mdash;all the way down to his &ldquo;second-best bed&rdquo;
and its furniture.</p>
<p>It carefully and calculatingly distributed his riches among
the members of his family, overlooking no individual of it.&nbsp;
Not even his wife: the wife he had been enabled to marry in a
hurry by urgent grace of a special dispensation before he was
nineteen; the wife whom he had left husbandless so many years;
the wife who had had to borrow forty-one shillings in her need,
and which the lender was never able to collect of the prosperous
husband, but died at last with the money still lacking.&nbsp; No,
even this wife was remembered in Shakespeare&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>He left her that &ldquo;second-best bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And <i>not another thing</i>; not even a penny to bless her
lucky widowhood with.</p>
<p>It was eminently and conspicuously a business man&rsquo;s
will, not a poet&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It mentioned <i>not a single book</i>.</p>
<p>Books were much more precious than swords and silver-gilt
bowls and second-best beds in those days, and when a departing
person owned one he gave it a high place in his will.</p>
<p>The will mentioned <i>not a play</i>,<i> not a poem</i>,<i>
not an unfinished literary work</i>, <i>not a scrap of manuscript
of any kind</i>.</p>
<p>Many poets have died poor, but this is the only one in history
that has died <i>this</i> poor; the others all left literary
remains behind.&nbsp; Also a book.&nbsp; Maybe two.</p>
<p>If Shakespeare had owned a dog&mdash;but we need not go into
that: we know he would have mentioned it in his will.&nbsp; If a
good dog, Susanna would have got it; if an inferior one his wife
would have got a dower interest in it.&nbsp; I wish he had had a
dog, just so we could see how painstakingly he would have divided
that dog among the family, in his careful business way.</p>
<p>He signed the will in three places.</p>
<p>In earlier years he signed two other official documents.</p>
<p>These five signatures still exist.</p>
<p>There are <i>no other specimens of his penmanship in
existence</i>.&nbsp; Not a line.</p>
<p>Was he prejudiced against the art?&nbsp; His granddaughter,
whom he loved, was eight years old when he died, yet she had had
no teaching, he left no provision for her education although he
was rich, and in her mature womanhood she couldn&rsquo;t write
and couldn&rsquo;t tell her husband&rsquo;s manuscript from
anybody else&rsquo;s&mdash;she thought it was
Shakespeare&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>When Shakespeare died in Stratford <i>it was not an
event</i>.&nbsp; It made no more stir in England than the death
of any other forgotten theatre-actor would have made.&nbsp;
Nobody came down from London; there were no lamenting poems, no
eulogies, no national tears&mdash;there was merely silence, and
nothing more.&nbsp; A striking contrast with what happened when
Ben Jonson, and Francis Bacon, and Spenser, and Raleigh and the
other distinguished literary folk of Shakespeare&rsquo;s time
passed from life!&nbsp; No praiseful voice was lifted for the
lost Bard of Avon; even Ben Jonson waited seven years before he
lifted his.</p>
<p><i>So far as anybody actually knows and can prove</i>,
Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon never wrote a play in his
life.</p>
<p><i>So far as anybody knows and can prove</i>, he never wrote a
letter to anybody in his life.</p>
<p><i>So far as any one knows</i>, <i>he received only one letter
during his life</i>.</p>
<p>So far as any one <i>knows and can prove</i>, Shakespeare of
Stratford wrote only one poem during his life.&nbsp; This one is
authentic.&nbsp; He did write that one&mdash;a fact which stands
undisputed; he wrote the whole of it; he wrote the whole of it
out of his own head.&nbsp; He commanded that this work of art be
engraved upon his tomb, and he was obeyed.&nbsp; There it abides
to this day.&nbsp; This is it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare<br />
To digg the dust encloased heare:<br />
Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones<br />
And curst be he yt moves my bones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the list as above set down, will be found <i>every
positively known</i> fact of Shakespeare&rsquo;s life, lean and
meagre as the invoice is.&nbsp; Beyond these details we know
<i>not a thing</i> about him.&nbsp; All the rest of his vast
history, as furnished by the biographers, is built up, course
upon course, of guesses, inferences, theories,
conjectures&mdash;an Eiffel Tower of artificialities rising
sky-high from a very flat and very thin foundation of
inconsequential facts.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV&mdash;CONJECTURES</h2>
<p>The historians &ldquo;suppose&rdquo; that Shakespeare attended
the Free School in Stratford from the time he was seven years old
till he was thirteen.&nbsp; There is no <i>evidence</i> in
existence that he ever went to school at all.</p>
<p>The historians &ldquo;infer&rdquo; that he got his Latin in
that school&mdash;the school which they &ldquo;suppose&rdquo; he
attended.</p>
<p>They &ldquo;suppose&rdquo; his father&rsquo;s declining
fortunes made it necessary for him to leave the school they
supposed he attended, and get to work and help support his
parents and their ten children.&nbsp; But there is no evidence
that he ever entered or retired from the school they suppose he
attended.</p>
<p>They &ldquo;suppose&rdquo; he assisted his father in the
butchering business; and that, being only a boy, he didn&rsquo;t
have to do full-grown butchering, but only slaughtered
calves.&nbsp; Also, that whenever he killed a calf he made a
high-flown speech over it.&nbsp; This supposition rests upon the
testimony of a man who wasn&rsquo;t there at the time; a man who
got it from a man who could have been there, but did not say
whether he was or not; and neither of them thought to mention it
for decades, and decades, and decades, and two more decades after
Shakespeare&rsquo;s death (until old age and mental decay had
refreshed and vivified their memories).&nbsp; They hadn&rsquo;t
two facts in stock about the long-dead distinguished citizen, but
only just the one: he slaughtered calves and broke into oratory
while he was at it.&nbsp; Curious.&nbsp; They had only one fact,
yet the distinguished citizen had spent twenty-six years in that
little town&mdash;just half his lifetime.&nbsp; However, rightly
viewed, it was the most important fact, indeed almost the only
important fact, of Shakespeare&rsquo;s life in Stratford.&nbsp;
Rightly viewed.&nbsp; For experience is an author&rsquo;s most
valuable asset; experience is the thing that puts the muscle and
the breath and the warm blood into the book he writes.&nbsp;
Rightly viewed, calf-butchering accounts for <i>Titus
Andronicus</i>, the only play&mdash;ain&rsquo;t it?&mdash;that
the Stratford Shakespeare ever wrote; and yet it is the only one
everybody tries to chouse him out of, the Baconians included.</p>
<p>The historians find themselves &ldquo;justified in
believing&rdquo; that the young Shakespeare poached upon Sir
Thomas Lucy&rsquo;s deer preserves and got haled before that
magistrate for it.&nbsp; But there is no shred of respectworthy
evidence that anything of the kind happened.</p>
<p>The historians, having argued the thing that <i>might</i> have
happened into the thing that <i>did</i> happen, found no trouble
in turning Sir Thomas Lucy into Mr. Justice Shallow.&nbsp; They
have long ago convinced the world&mdash;on surmise and without
trustworthy evidence&mdash;that Shallow <i>is</i> Sir Thomas.</p>
<p>The next addition to the young Shakespeare&rsquo;s Stratford
history comes easy.&nbsp; The historian builds it out of the
surmised deer-stealing, and the surmised trial before the
magistrate, and the surmised vengeance-prompted satire upon the
magistrate in the play: result, the young Shakespeare was a wild,
wild, wild, oh <i>such</i> a wild young scamp, and that
gratuitous slander is established for all time!&nbsp; It is the
very way Professor Osborn and I built the colossal skeleton
brontosaur that stands fifty-seven feet long and sixteen feet
high in the Natural History Museum, the awe and admiration of all
the world, the stateliest skeleton that exists on the
planet.&nbsp; We had nine bones, and we built the rest of him out
of plaster of paris.&nbsp; We ran short of plaster of paris, or
we&rsquo;d have built a brontosaur that could sit down beside the
Stratford Shakespeare and none but an expert could tell which was
biggest or contained the most plaster.</p>
<p>Shakespeare pronounced <i>Venus and Adonis</i> &ldquo;the
first heir of his invention,&rdquo; apparently implying that it
was his first effort at literary composition.&nbsp; He should not
have said it.&nbsp; It has been an embarrassment to his
historians these many, many years.&nbsp; They have to make him
write that graceful and polished and flawless and beautiful poem
before he escaped from Stratford and his family&mdash;1586 or
&rsquo;87&mdash;age, twenty-two, or along there; because within
the next five years he wrote five great plays, and could not have
found time to write another line.</p>
<p>It is sorely embarrassing.&nbsp; If he began to slaughter
calves, and poach deer, and rollick around, and learn English, at
the earliest likely moment&mdash;say at thirteen, when he was
supposably wrenched from that school where he was supposably
storing up Latin for future literary use&mdash;he had his
youthful hands full, and much more than full.&nbsp; He must have
had to put aside his Warwickshire dialect, which wouldn&rsquo;t
be understood in London, and study English very hard.&nbsp; Very
hard indeed; incredibly hard, almost, if the result of that labor
was to be the smooth and rounded and flexible and letter-perfect
English of the <i>Venus and Adonis</i> in the space of ten years;
and at the same time learn great and fine and unsurpassable
literary form.</p>
<p>However, it is &ldquo;conjectured&rdquo; that he accomplished
all this and more, much more: learned law and its intricacies;
and the complex procedure of the law courts; and all about
soldiering, and sailoring, and the manners and customs and ways
of royal courts and aristocratic society; and likewise
accumulated in his one head every kind of knowledge the learned
then possessed, and every kind of humble knowledge possessed by
the lowly and the ignorant; and added thereto a wider and more
intimate knowledge of the world&rsquo;s great literatures,
ancient and modern, than was possessed by any other man of his
time&mdash;for he was going to make brilliant and easy and
admiration-compelling use of these splendid treasures the moment
he got to London.&nbsp; And according to the surmisers, that is
what he did.&nbsp; Yes, although there was no one in Stratford
able to teach him these things, and no library in the little
village to dig them out of.&nbsp; His father could not read, and
even the surmisers surmise that he did not keep a library.</p>
<p>It is surmised by the biographers that the young Shakespeare
got his vast knowledge of the law and his familiar and accurate
acquaintance with the manners and customs and shop-talk of
lawyers through being for a time the <i>clerk of a Stratford
court</i>; just as a bright lad like me, reared in a village on
the banks of the Mississippi, might become perfect in knowledge
of the Behring Strait whale-fishery and the shop-talk of the
veteran exercisers of that adventure-bristling trade through
catching catfish with a &ldquo;trot-line&rdquo; Sundays.&nbsp;
But the surmise is damaged by the fact that there is no
evidence&mdash;and not even tradition&mdash;that the young
Shakespeare was ever clerk of a law court.</p>
<p>It is further surmised that the young Shakespeare accumulated
his law-treasures in the first years of his sojourn in London,
through &ldquo;amusing himself&rdquo; by learning book-law in his
garret and by picking up lawyer-talk and the rest of it through
loitering about the law-courts and listening.&nbsp; But it is
only surmise; there is no <i>evidence</i> that he ever did either
of those things.&nbsp; They are merely a couple of chunks of
plaster of paris.</p>
<p>There is a legend that he got his bread and butter by holding
horses in front of the London theatres, mornings and
afternoons.&nbsp; Maybe he did.&nbsp; If he did, it seriously
shortened his law-study hours and his recreation-time in the
courts.&nbsp; In those very days he was writing great plays, and
needed all the time he could get.&nbsp; The horse-holding legend
ought to be strangled; it too formidably increases the
historian&rsquo;s difficulty in accounting for the young
Shakespeare&rsquo;s erudition&mdash;an erudition which he was
acquiring, hunk by hunk and chunk by chunk every day in those
strenuous times, and emptying each day&rsquo;s catch into next
day&rsquo;s imperishable drama.</p>
<p>He had to acquire a knowledge of war at the same time; and a
knowledge of soldier-people and sailor-people and their ways and
talk; also a knowledge of some foreign lands and their languages:
for he was daily emptying fluent streams of these various
knowledges, too, into his dramas.&nbsp; How did he acquire these
rich assets?</p>
<p>In the usual way: by surmise.&nbsp; It is <i>surmised</i> that
he travelled in Italy and Germany and around, and qualified
himself to put their scenic and social aspects upon paper; that
he perfected himself in French, Italian and Spanish on the road;
that he went in Leicester&rsquo;s expedition to the Low
Countries, as soldier or sutler or something, for several months
or years&mdash;or whatever length of time a surmiser needs in his
business&mdash;and thus became familiar with soldiership and
soldier-ways and soldier-talk, and generalship and general-ways
and general-talk, and seamanship and sailor-ways and
sailor-talk.</p>
<p>Maybe he did all these things, but I would like to know who
held the horses in the meantime; and who studied the books in the
garret; and who frollicked in the law-courts for
recreation.&nbsp; Also, who did the call-boying and the
play-acting.</p>
<p>For he became a call-boy; and as early as &rsquo;93 he became
a &ldquo;vagabond&rdquo;&mdash;the law&rsquo;s ungentle term for
an unlisted actor; and in &rsquo;94 a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; and
properly and officially listed member of that (in those days)
lightly-valued and not much respected profession.</p>
<p>Right soon thereafter he became a stockholder in two theatres,
and manager of them.&nbsp; Thenceforward he was a busy and
flourishing business man, and was raking in money with both hands
for twenty years.&nbsp; Then in a noble frenzy of poetic
inspiration he wrote his one poem&mdash;his only poem, his
darling&mdash;and laid him down and died:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare<br />
To digg the dust encloased heare:<br />
Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones<br />
And curst be he yt moves my bones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was probably dead when he wrote it.&nbsp; Still, this is
only conjecture.&nbsp; We have only circumstantial
evidence.&nbsp; Internal evidence.</p>
<p>Shall I set down the rest of the Conjectures which constitute
the giant Biography of William Shakespeare?&nbsp; It would strain
the Unabridged Dictionary to hold them.&nbsp; He is a Brontosaur:
nine bones and six hundred barrels of plaster of paris.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V&mdash;&ldquo;We May Assume&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In the Assuming trade three separate and independent cults are
transacting business.&nbsp; Two of these cults are known as the
Shakespearites and the Baconians, and I am the other
one&mdash;the Brontosaurian.</p>
<p>The Shakespearite knows that Shakespeare wrote
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Works; the Baconian knows that Francis Bacon
wrote them; the Brontosaurian doesn&rsquo;t really know which of
them did it, but is quite composedly and contentedly sure that
Shakespeare <i>didn&rsquo;t</i>, and strongly suspects that Bacon
<i>did</i>.&nbsp; We all have to do a good deal of assuming, but
I am fairly certain that in every case I can call to mind the
Baconian assumers have come out ahead of the
Shakespearites.&nbsp; Both parties handle the same materials, but
the Baconians seem to me to get much more reasonable and rational
and persuasive results out of them than is the case with the
Shakespearites.&nbsp; The Shakespearite conducts his assuming
upon a definite principle, an unchanging and immutable
law&mdash;which is: 2 and 8 and 7 and 14, added together, make
165.&nbsp; I believe this to be an error.&nbsp; No matter, you
cannot get a habit-sodden Shakespearite to cipher-up his
materials upon any other basis.&nbsp; With the Baconian it is
different.&nbsp; If you place before him the above figures and
set him to adding them up, he will never in any case get more
than 45 out of them, and in nine cases out of ten he will get
just the proper 31.</p>
<p>Let me try to illustrate the two systems in a simple and
homely way calculated to bring the idea within the grasp of the
ignorant and unintelligent.&nbsp; We will suppose a case: take a
lap-bred, house-fed, uneducated, inexperienced kitten; take a
rugged old Tom that&rsquo;s scarred from stem to rudder-post with
the memorials of strenuous experience, and is so cultured, so
educated, so limitlessly erudite that one may say of him
&ldquo;all cat-knowledge is his province&rdquo;; also, take a
mouse.&nbsp; Lock the three up in a holeless, crackless, exitless
prison-cell.&nbsp; Wait half an hour, then open the cell,
introduce a Shakespearite and a Baconian, and let them cipher and
assume.&nbsp; The mouse is missing: the question to be decided
is, where is it?&nbsp; You can guess both verdicts
beforehand.&nbsp; One verdict will say the kitten contains the
mouse; the other will as certainly say the mouse is in the
tomcat.</p>
<p>The Shakespearite will Reason like this&mdash;(that is not my
word, it is his).&nbsp; He will say the kitten <i>may have
been</i> attending school when nobody was noticing; therefore
<i>we are warranted in assuming</i> that it did so; also, it
<i>could have been</i> training in a court-clerk&rsquo;s office
when no one was noticing; since that could have happened, <i>we
are justified in assuming</i> that it did happen; it <i>could
have studied catology in a garret</i> when no one was
noticing&mdash;therefore it <i>did</i>; it <i>could have</i>
attended cat-assizes on the shed-roof nights, for recreation,
when no one was noticing, and harvested a knowledge of cat
court-forms and cat lawyer-talk in that way: it <i>could</i> have
done it, therefore without a doubt it did; it could have gone
soldiering with a war-tribe when no one was noticing, and learned
soldier-wiles and soldier-ways, and what to do with a mouse when
opportunity offers; the plain inference, therefore is, that that
is what it <i>did</i>.&nbsp; Since all these manifold things
<i>could</i> have occurred, we have <i>every right to believe</i>
they did occur.&nbsp; These patiently and painstakingly
accumulated vast acquirements and competences needed but one
thing more&mdash;opportunity&mdash;to convert themselves into
triumphant action.&nbsp; The opportunity came, we have the
result; <i>beyond shadow of question</i> the mouse is in the
kitten.</p>
<p>It is proper to remark that when we of the three cults plant a
&ldquo;<i>We think we may assume</i>,&rdquo; we expect it, under
careful watering and fertilizing and tending, to grow up into a
strong and hardy and weather-defying &ldquo;<i>there isn&rsquo;t
a shadow of a doubt</i>&rdquo; at last&mdash;and it usually
happens.</p>
<p>We know what the Baconian&rsquo;s verdict would be:
&ldquo;<i>There is not a rag of evidence that the kitten has had
any training</i>, <i>any education</i>, <i>any experience
qualifying it for the present occasion</i>, <i>or is indeed
equipped for any achievement above lifting such unclaimed milk as
comes its way</i>; <i>but there is abundant
evidence</i>&mdash;<i>unassailable proof</i>, <i>in
fact</i>&mdash;<i>that the other animal is equipped</i>, <i>to
the last detail</i>, <i>with every qualification necessary for
the event</i>.&nbsp; <i>Without shadow of doubt the tomcat
contains the mouse</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>When Shakespeare died, in 1616, great literary productions
attributed to him as author had been before the London world and
in high favor for twenty-four years.&nbsp; Yet his death was not
an event.&nbsp; It made no stir, it attracted no attention.&nbsp;
Apparently his eminent literary contemporaries did not realize
that a celebrated poet had passed from their midst.&nbsp; Perhaps
they knew a play-actor of minor rank had disappeared, but did not
regard him as the author of his Works.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are
justified in assuming&rdquo; this.</p>
<p>His death was not even an event in the little town of
Stratford.&nbsp; Does this mean that in Stratford he was not
regarded as a celebrity of <i>any</i> kind?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are privileged to assume&rdquo;&mdash;no, we are
indeed <i>obliged</i> to assume&mdash;that such was the
case.&nbsp; He had spent the first twenty-two or twenty-three
years of his life there, and of course knew everybody and was
known by everybody of that day in the town, including the dogs
and the cats and the horses.&nbsp; He had spent the last five or
six years of his life there, diligently trading in every big and
little thing that had money in it; so we are compelled to assume
that many of the folk there in those said latter days knew him
personally, and the rest by sight and hearsay.&nbsp; But not as a
<i>celebrity</i>?&nbsp; Apparently not.&nbsp; For everybody soon
forgot to remember any contact with him or any incident connected
with him.&nbsp; The dozens of townspeople, still alive, who had
known of him or known about him in the first twenty-three years
of his life were in the same unremembering condition: if they
knew of any incident connected with that period of his life they
didn&rsquo;t tell about it.&nbsp; Would they if they had been
asked?&nbsp; It is most likely.&nbsp; Were they asked?&nbsp; It
is pretty apparent that they were not.&nbsp; Why weren&rsquo;t
they?&nbsp; It is a very plausible guess that nobody there or
elsewhere was interested to know.</p>
<p>For seven years after Shakespeare&rsquo;s death nobody seems
to have been interested in him.&nbsp; Then the quarto was
published, and Ben Jonson awoke out of his long indifference and
sang a song of praise and put it in the front of the book.&nbsp;
Then silence fell <i>again</i>.</p>
<p>For sixty years.&nbsp; Then inquiries into Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Stratford life began to be made, of Stratfordians.&nbsp; Of
Stratfordians who had known Shakespeare or had seen him?&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; Then of Stratfordians who had seen people who had known
or seen people who had seen Shakespeare?&nbsp; No.&nbsp;
Apparently the inquiries were only made of Stratfordians who were
not Stratfordians of Shakespeare&rsquo;s day, but later comers;
and what they had learned had come to them from persons who had
not seen Shakespeare; and what they had learned was not claimed
as <i>fact</i>, but only as legend&mdash;dim and fading and
indefinite legend; legend of the calf-slaughtering rank, and not
worth remembering either as history or fiction.</p>
<p>Has it ever happened before&mdash;or since&mdash;that a
celebrated person who had spent exactly half of a fairly long
life in the village where he was born and reared, was able to
slip out of this world and leave that village voiceless and
gossipless behind him&mdash;utterly voiceless, utterly
gossipless?&nbsp; And permanently so?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe
it has happened in any case except Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And
couldn&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t have happened in his case if he
had been regarded as a celebrity at the time of his death.</p>
<p>When I examine my own case&mdash;but let us do that, and see
if it will not be recognizable as exhibiting a condition of
things quite likely to result, most likely to result, indeed
substantially <i>sure</i> to result in the case of a celebrated
person, a benefactor of the human race.&nbsp; Like me.</p>
<p>My parents brought me to the village of Hannibal, Missouri, on
the banks of the Mississippi, when I was two and a half years
old.&nbsp; I entered school at five years of age, and drifted
from one school to another in the village during nine and a half
years.&nbsp; Then my father died, leaving his family in
exceedingly straitened circumstances; wherefore my book-education
came to a standstill forever, and I became a printer&rsquo;s
apprentice, on board and clothes, and when the clothes failed I
got a hymn-book in place of them.&nbsp; This for summer wear,
probably.&nbsp; I lived in Hannibal fifteen and a half years,
altogether, then ran away, according to the custom of persons who
are intending to become celebrated.&nbsp; I never lived there
afterward.&nbsp; Four years later I became a &ldquo;cub&rdquo; on
a Mississippi steamboat in the St. Louis and New Orleans trade,
and after a year and a half of hard study and hard work the U. S.
inspectors rigorously examined me through a couple of long
sittings and decided that I knew every inch of the
Mississippi&mdash;thirteen hundred miles&mdash;in the dark and in
the day&mdash;as well as a baby knows the way to its
mother&rsquo;s paps day or night.&nbsp; So they licensed me as a
pilot&mdash;knighted me, so to speak&mdash;and I rose up clothed
with authority, a responsible servant of the United States
government.</p>
<p>Now then.&nbsp; Shakespeare died young&mdash;he was only
fifty-two.&nbsp; He had lived in his native village twenty-six
years, or about that.&nbsp; He died celebrated (if you believe
everything you read in the books).&nbsp; Yet when he died nobody
there or elsewhere took any notice of it; and for sixty years
afterward no townsman remembered to say anything about him or
about his life in Stratford.&nbsp; When the inquirer came at last
he got but one fact&mdash;no, <i>legend</i>&mdash;and got that
one at second hand, from a person who had only heard it as a
rumor, and didn&rsquo;t claim copyright in it as a production of
his own.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t, very well, for its date
antedated his own birth-date.&nbsp; But necessarily a number of
persons were still alive in Stratford who, in the days of their
youth, had seen Shakespeare nearly every day in the last five
years of his life, and they would have been able to tell that
inquirer some first-hand things about him if he had in those last
days been a celebrity and therefore a person of interest to the
villagers.&nbsp; Why did not the inquirer hunt them up and
interview them?&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it worth while?&nbsp;
Wasn&rsquo;t the matter of sufficient consequence?&nbsp; Had the
inquirer an engagement to see a dog-fight and couldn&rsquo;t
spare the time?</p>
<p>It all seems to mean that he never had any literary celebrity,
there or elsewhere, and no considerable repute as actor and
manager.</p>
<p>Now then, I am away along in life&mdash;my seventy-third year
being already well behind me&mdash;yet <i>sixteen</i> of my
Hannibal schoolmates are still alive to-day, and can
tell&mdash;and do tell&mdash;inquirers dozens and dozens of
incidents of their young lives and mine together; things that
happened to us in the morning of life, in the blossom of our
youth, in the good days, the dear days, &ldquo;the days when we
went gipsying, a long time ago.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most of them
creditable to me, too.&nbsp; One child to whom I paid court when
she was five years old and I eight still lives in Hannibal, and
she visited me last summer, traversing the necessary ten or
twelve hundred miles of railroad without damage to her patience
or to her old-young vigor.&nbsp; Another little lassie to whom I
paid attention in Hannibal when she was nine years old and I the
same, is still alive&mdash;in London&mdash;and hale and hearty,
just as I am.&nbsp; And on the few surviving
steamboats&mdash;those lingering ghosts and remembrancers of
great fleets that plied the big river in the beginning of my
water-career&mdash;which is exactly as long ago as the whole
invoice of the life-years of Shakespeare number&mdash;there are
still findable two or three river-pilots who saw me do creditable
things in those ancient days; and several white-headed engineers;
and several roustabouts and mates; and several deck-hands who
used to heave the lead for me and send up on the still night air
the &ldquo;six&mdash;feet&mdash;<i>scant</i>!&rdquo; that made me
shudder, and the &ldquo;<i>M-a-r-k&mdash;twain</i>!&rdquo; that
took the shudder away, and presently the darling &ldquo;By the
d-e-e-p&mdash;four!&rdquo; that lifted me to heaven for joy. <a
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a>&nbsp; They know about me, and can
tell.&nbsp; And so do printers, from St. Louis to New York; and
so do newspaper reporters, from Nevada to San Francisco.&nbsp;
And so do the police.&nbsp; If Shakespeare had really been
celebrated, like me, Stratford could have told things about him;
and if my experience goes for anything, they&rsquo;d have done
it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>If I had under my superintendence a controversy appointed to
decide whether Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare or not, I believe I
would place before the debaters only the one question, <i>Was
Shakespeare ever a practicing lawyer</i>? and leave everything
else out.</p>
<p>It is maintained that the man who wrote the plays was not
merely myriad-minded, but also myriad-accomplished: that he not
only knew some thousands of things about human life in all its
shades and grades, and about the hundred arts and trades and
crafts and professions which men busy themselves in, but that he
could <i>talk</i> about the men and their grades and trades
accurately, making no mistakes.&nbsp; Maybe it is so, but have
the experts spoken, or is it only Tom, Dick, and Harry?&nbsp;
Does the exhibit stand upon wide, and loose, and eloquent
generalizing&mdash;which is not evidence, and not proof&mdash;or
upon details, particulars, statistics, illustrations,
demonstrations?</p>
<p>Experts of unchallengeable authority have testified definitely
as to only one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s multifarious
craft-equipments, so far as my recollections of Shakespeare-Bacon
talk abide with me&mdash;his law-equipment.&nbsp; I do not
remember that Wellington or Napoleon ever examined
Shakespeare&rsquo;s battles and sieges and strategies, and then
decided and established for good and all, that they were
militarily flawless; I do not remember that any Nelson, or Drake
or Cook ever examined his seamanship and said it showed profound
and accurate familiarity with that art; I don&rsquo;t remember
that any king or prince or duke has ever testified that
Shakespeare was letter-perfect in his handling of royal
court-manners and the talk and manners of aristocracies; I
don&rsquo;t remember that any illustrious Latinist or Grecian or
Frenchman or Spaniard or Italian has proclaimed him a past-master
in those languages; I don&rsquo;t remember&mdash;well, I
don&rsquo;t remember that there is <i>testimony</i>&mdash;great
testimony&mdash;imposing testimony&mdash;unanswerable and
unattackable testimony as to any of Shakespeare&rsquo;s hundred
specialties, except one&mdash;the law.</p>
<p>Other things change, with time, and the student cannot trace
back with certainty the changes that various trades and their
processes and technicalities have undergone in the long stretch
of a century or two and find out what their processes and
technicalities were in those early days, but with the law it is
different: it is mile-stoned and documented all the way back, and
the master of that wonderful trade, that complex and intricate
trade, that awe-compelling trade, has competent ways of knowing
whether Shakespeare-law is good law or not; and whether his
law-court procedure is correct or not, and whether his legal
shop-talk is the shop-talk of a veteran practitioner or only a
machine-made counterfeit of it gathered from books and from
occasional loiterings in Westminster.</p>
<p>Richard H. Dana served two years before the mast, and had
every experience that falls to the lot of the sailor before the
mast of our day.&nbsp; His sailor-talk flows from his pen with
the sure touch and the ease and confidence of a person who has
<i>lived</i> what he is talking about, not gathered it from books
and random listenings.&nbsp; Hear him:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having hove short, cast off the gaskets, and made
the bunt of each sail fast by the jigger, with a man on each
yard, at the word the whole canvas of the ship was loosed, and
with the greatest rapidity possible everything was sheeted home
and hoisted up, the anchor tripped and cat-headed, and the ship
under headway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:</p>
<blockquote><p>The royal yards were all crossed at once, and
royals and sky-sails set, and, as we had the wind free, the booms
were run out, and all were aloft, active as cats, laying out on
the yards and booms, reeving the studding-sail gear; and sail
after sail the captain piled upon her, until she was covered with
canvas, her sails looking like a great white cloud resting upon a
black speck.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once more.&nbsp; A race in the Pacific:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our antagonist was in her best trim.&nbsp; Being
clear of the point, the breeze became stiff, and the royal-masts
bent under our sails, but we would not take them in until we saw
three boys spring into the rigging of the <i>California</i>; then
they were all furled at once, but with orders to our boys to stay
aloft at the top-gallant mast-heads and loose them again at the
word.&nbsp; It was my duty to furl the fore-royal; and while
standing by to loose it again, I had a fine view of the
scene.&nbsp; From where I stood, the two vessels seemed nothing
but spars and sails, while their narrow decks, far below,
slanting over by the force of the wind aloft, appeared hardly
capable of supporting the great fabrics raised upon them.&nbsp;
The <i>California</i> was to windward of us, and had every
advantage; yet, while the breeze was stiff we held our own.&nbsp;
As soon as it began to slacken she ranged a little ahead, and the
order was given to loose the royals.&nbsp; In an instant the
gaskets were off and the bunt dropped.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sheet home
the fore-royal!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Weather sheet&rsquo;s
home!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Lee sheet&rsquo;s
home!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hoist away, sir!&rdquo; is bawled from
aloft.&nbsp; &ldquo;Overhaul your clewlines!&rdquo; shouts the
mate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Aye-aye, sir, all
clear!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Taut leech! belay!&nbsp; Well the lee
brace; haul taut to windward!&rdquo; and the royals are set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What would the captain of any sailing-vessel of our time say
to that?&nbsp; He would say, &ldquo;The man that wrote that
didn&rsquo;t learn his trade out of a book, he has <i>been</i>
there!&rdquo;&nbsp; But would this same captain be competent to
sit in judgment upon Shakespeare&rsquo;s
seamanship&mdash;considering the changes in ships and ship-talk
that have necessarily taken place, unrecorded, unremembered, and
lost to history in the last three hundred years?&nbsp; It is my
conviction that Shakespeare&rsquo;s sailor-talk would be Choctaw
to him.&nbsp; For instance&mdash;from <i>The Tempest</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Master</i>.&nbsp; Boatswain!</p>
<p><i>Boatswain</i>.&nbsp; Here, master; what cheer?</p>
<p><i>Master</i>.&nbsp; Good, speak to the mariners: fall
to&rsquo;t, yarely, or we run ourselves to ground; bestir,
bestir!</p>
<p>(<i>Enter mariners</i>.)</p>
<p><i>Boatswain</i>.&nbsp; Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my
hearts! yare, yare!&nbsp; Take in the topsail.&nbsp; Tend to the
master&rsquo;s whistle . . . Down with the topmast! yare! lower,
lower!&nbsp; Bring her to try wi&rsquo; the main course . . . Lay
her a-hold, a-hold!&nbsp; Set her two courses.&nbsp; Off to sea
again; lay her off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That will do, for the present; let us yare a little, now, for
a change.</p>
<p>If a man should write a book and in it make one of his
characters say, &ldquo;Here, devil, empty the quoins into the
standing galley and the imposing stone into the hell-box;
assemble the comps around the frisket and let them jeff for takes
and be quick about it,&rdquo; I should recognize a mistake or two
in the phrasing, and would know that the writer was only a
printer theoretically, not practically.</p>
<p>I have been a quartz miner in the silver regions&mdash;a
pretty hard life; I know all the palaver of that business: I know
all about discovery claims and the subordinate claims; I know all
about lodes, ledges, outcroppings, dips, spurs, angles, shafts,
drifts, inclines, levels, tunnels, air-shafts,
&ldquo;horses,&rdquo; clay casings, granite casings; quartz mills
and their batteries; arastras, and how to charge them with
quicksilver and sulphate of copper; and how to clean them up, and
how to reduce the resulting amalgam in the retorts, and how to
cast the bullion into pigs; and finally I know how to screen
tailings, and also how to hunt for something less robust to do,
and find it.&nbsp; I know the <i>argot</i> of the quartz-mining
and milling industry familiarly; and so whenever Bret Harte
introduces that industry into a story, the first time one of his
miners opens his mouth I recognize from his phrasing that Harte
got the phrasing by listening&mdash;like Shakespeare&mdash;I mean
the Stratford one&mdash;not by experience.&nbsp; No one can talk
the quartz dialect correctly without learning it with pick and
shovel and drill and fuse.</p>
<p>I have been a surface-miner&mdash;gold&mdash;and I know all
its mysteries, and the dialect that belongs with them; and
whenever Harte introduces that industry into a story I know by
the phrasing of his characters that neither he nor they have ever
served that trade.</p>
<p>I have been a &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; miner&mdash;a sort of gold
mining not findable in any but one little spot in the world, so
far as I know.&nbsp; I know how, with horn and water, to find the
trail of a pocket and trace it step by step and stage by stage up
the mountain to its source, and find the compact little nest of
yellow metal reposing in its secret home under the ground.&nbsp;
I know the language of that trade, that capricious trade, that
fascinating buried-treasure trade, and can catch any writer who
tries to use it without having learned it by the sweat of his
brow and the labor of his hands.</p>
<p>I know several other trades and the <i>argot</i> that goes
with them; and whenever a person tries to talk the talk peculiar
to any of them without having learned it at its source I can trap
him always before he gets far on his road.</p>
<p>And so, as I have already remarked, if I were required to
superintend a Bacon-Shakespeare controversy, I would narrow the
matter down to a single question&mdash;the only one, so far as
the previous controversies have informed me, concerning which
illustrious experts of unimpeachable competency have testified:
<i>Was the author of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Works a
lawyer</i>?&mdash;a lawyer deeply read and of limitless
experience?&nbsp; I would put aside the guesses, and surmises,
and perhapses, and might-have-beens, and could-have beens, and
must-have-beens, and we-are justified-in-presumings, and the rest
of those vague spectres and shadows and indefinitenesses, and
stand or fall, win or lose, by the verdict rendered by the jury
upon that single question.&nbsp; If the verdict was Yes, I should
feel quite convinced that the Stratford Shakespeare, the actor,
manager, and trader who died so obscure, so forgotten, so
destitute of even village consequence that sixty years afterward
no fellow-citizen and friend of his later days remembered to tell
anything about him, did not write the Works.</p>
<p>Chapter XIII of <i>The Shakespeare Problem Restated</i> bears
the heading &ldquo;Shakespeare as a Lawyer,&rdquo; and comprises
some fifty pages of expert testimony, with comments thereon, and
I will copy the first nine, as being sufficient all by
themselves, as it seems to me, to settle the question which I
have conceived to be the master-key to the Shakespeare-Bacon
puzzle.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;Shakespeare as a Lawyer <a
name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a></h2>
<p>The Plays and Poems of Shakespeare supply ample evidence that
their author not only had a very extensive and accurate knowledge
of law, but that he was well acquainted with the manners and
customs of members of the Inns of Court and with legal life
generally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While novelists and dramatists are constantly making
mistakes as to the laws of marriage, of wills, and inheritance,
to Shakespeare&rsquo;s law, lavishly as he expounds it, there can
neither be demurrer, nor bill of exceptions, nor writ of
error.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such was the testimony borne by one of the
most distinguished lawyers of the nineteenth century who was
raised to the high office of Lord Chief Justice in 1850, and
subsequently became Lord Chancellor.&nbsp; Its weight will,
doubtless, be more appreciated by lawyers than by laymen, for
only lawyers know how impossible it is for those who have not
served an apprenticeship to the law to avoid displaying their
ignorance if they venture to employ legal terms and to discuss
legal doctrines.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is nothing so
dangerous,&rdquo; wrote Lord Campbell, &ldquo;as for one not of
the craft to tamper with our freemasonry.&rdquo;&nbsp; A layman
is certain to betray himself by using some expression which a
lawyer would never employ.&nbsp; Mr. Sidney Lee himself supplies
us with an example of this.&nbsp; He writes (p. 164): &ldquo;On
February 15, 1609, Shakespeare . . . obtained judgment from a
jury against Addenbroke for the payment of No. 6, and No. 1.
5<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> costs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now a lawyer would
never have spoken of obtaining &ldquo;judgment from a
jury,&rdquo; for it is the function of a jury not to deliver
judgment (which is the prerogative of the court), but to find a
verdict on the facts.&nbsp; The error is, indeed, a venial one,
but it is just one of those little things which at once enable a
lawyer to know if the writer is a layman or &ldquo;one of the
craft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when a layman ventures to plunge deeply into legal
subjects, he is naturally apt to make an exhibition of his
incompetence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let a non-professional man, however
acute,&rdquo; writes Lord Campbell again, &ldquo;presume to talk
law, or to draw illustrations from legal science in discussing
other subjects, and he will speedily fall into laughable
absurdity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And what does the same high authority say about
Shakespeare?&nbsp; He had &ldquo;a deep technical knowledge of
the law,&rdquo; and an easy familiarity with &ldquo;some of the
most abstruse proceedings in English jurisprudence.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And again: &ldquo;Whenever he indulges this propensity he
uniformly lays down good law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of <i>Henry IV.</i>,
Part 2, he says: &ldquo;If Lord Eldon could be supposed to have
written the play, I do not see how he could be chargeable with
having forgotten any of his law while writing it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Charles and Mary Cowden Clarke speak of &ldquo;the marvelous
intimacy which he displays with legal terms, his frequent
adoption of them in illustration, and his curiously technical
knowledge of their form and force.&rdquo;&nbsp; Malone, himself a
lawyer, wrote: &ldquo;His knowledge of legal terms is not merely
such as might be acquired by the casual observation of even his
all-comprehending mind; it has the appearance of technical
skill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another lawyer and well-known Shakespearean,
Richard Grant White, says: &ldquo;No dramatist of the time, not
even Beaumont, who was the younger son of a judge of the Common
Pleas, and who after studying in the Inns of Court abandoned law
for the drama, used legal phrases with Shakespeare&rsquo;s
readiness and exactness.&nbsp; And the significance of this fact
is heightened by another, that it is only to the language of the
law that he exhibits this inclination.&nbsp; The phrases peculiar
to other occupations serve him on rare occasions by way of
description, comparison or illustration, generally when something
in the scene suggests them, but legal phrases flow from his pen
as part of his vocabulary, and parcel of his thought.&nbsp; Take
the word &lsquo;purchase&rsquo; for instance, which, in ordinary
use, means to acquire by giving value, but applies in law to all
legal modes of obtaining property except by inheritance or
descent, and in this peculiar sense the word occurs five times in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s thirty-four plays, and only in one single
instance in the fifty-four plays of Beaumont and Fletcher.&nbsp;
It has been suggested that it was in attendance upon the courts
in London that he picked up his legal vocabulary.&nbsp; But this
supposition not only fails to account for Shakespeare&rsquo;s
peculiar freedom and exactness in the use of that phraseology, it
does not even place him in the way of learning those terms his
use of which is most remarkable, which are not such as he would
have heard at ordinary proceedings at <i>nisi prius</i>, but such
as refer to the tenure or transfer of real property, &lsquo;fine
and recovery,&rsquo; &lsquo;statutes merchant,&rsquo;
&lsquo;purchase,&rsquo; &lsquo;indenture,&rsquo;
&lsquo;tenure,&rsquo; &lsquo;double voucher,&rsquo; &lsquo;fee
simple,&rsquo; &lsquo;fee farm,&rsquo; &lsquo;remainder,&rsquo;
&lsquo;reversion,&rsquo; &lsquo;forfeiture,&rsquo; etc.&nbsp;
This conveyancer&rsquo;s jargon could not have been picked up by
hanging round the courts of law in London two hundred and fifty
years ago, when suits as to the title of real property were
comparatively rare.&nbsp; And beside, Shakespeare uses his law
just as freely in his first plays, written in his first London
years, as in those produced at a later period.&nbsp; Just as
exactly, too; for the correctness and propriety with which these
terms are introduced have compelled the admiration of a Chief
Justice and a Lord Chancellor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senator Davis wrote: &ldquo;We seem to have something more
than a sciolist&rsquo;s temerity of indulgence in the terms of an
unfamiliar art.&nbsp; No legal solecisms will be found.&nbsp; The
abstrusest elements of the common law are impressed into a
disciplined service.&nbsp; Over and over again, where such
knowledge is unexampled in writers unlearned in the law,
Shakespeare appears in perfect possession of it.&nbsp; In the law
of real property, its rules of tenure and descents, its entails,
its fines and recoveries, their vouchers and double vouchers, in
the procedure of the Courts, the method of bringing writs and
arrests, the nature of actions, the rules of pleading, the law of
escapes and of contempt of court, in the principles of evidence,
both technical and philosophical, in the distinction between the
temporal and spiritual tribunals, in the law of attainder and
forfeiture, in the requisites of a valid marriage, in the
presumption of legitimacy, in the learning of the law of
prerogative, in the inalienable character of the Crown, this
mastership appears with surprising authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To all this testimony (and there is much more which I have not
cited) may now be added that of a great lawyer of our own times,
<i>viz.</i>: Sir James Plaisted Wilde, Q.C. created a Baron of
the Exchequer in 1860, promoted to the post of Judge-Ordinary and
Judge of the Courts of Probate and Divorce in 1863, and better
known to the world as Lord Penzance, to which dignity he was
raised in 1869.&nbsp; Lord Penzance, as all lawyers know, and as
the late Mr. Inderwick, K.C., has testified, was one of the first
legal authorities of his day, famous for his &ldquo;remarkable
grasp of legal principles,&rdquo; and &ldquo;endowed by nature
with a remarkable facility for marshalling facts, and for a clear
expression of his views.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Penzance speaks of Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;perfect
familiarity with not only the principles, axioms, and maxims, but
the technicalities of English law, a knowledge so perfect and
intimate that he was never incorrect and never at fault . . . The
mode in which this knowledge was pressed into service on all
occasions to express his meaning and illustrate his thoughts, was
quite unexampled.&nbsp; He seems to have had a special pleasure
in his complete and ready mastership of it in all its
branches.&nbsp; As manifested in the plays, this legal knowledge
and learning had therefore a special character which places it on
a wholly different footing from the rest of the multifarious
knowledge which is exhibited in page after page of the
plays.&nbsp; At every turn and point at which the author required
a metaphor, simile, or illustration, his mind ever turned
<i>first</i> to the law.&nbsp; He seems almost to have
<i>thought</i> in legal phrases, the commonest of legal
expressions were ever at the end of his pen in description or
illustration.&nbsp; That he should have descanted in lawyer
language when he had a forensic subject in hand, such as
Shylock&rsquo;s bond, was to be expected, but the knowledge of
law in &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo; was exhibited in a far different
manner: it protruded itself on all occasions, appropriate or
inappropriate, and mingled itself with strains of thought widely
divergent from forensic subjects.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again: &ldquo;To
acquire a perfect familiarity with legal principles, and an
accurate and ready use of the technical terms and phrases not
only of the conveyancer&rsquo;s office but of the pleader&rsquo;s
chambers and the Courts at Westminster, nothing short of
employment in some career involving constant contact with legal
questions and general legal work would be requisite.&nbsp; But a
continuous employment involves the element of time, and time was
just what the manager of two theatres had not at his
disposal.&nbsp; In what portion of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
(<i>i.e.</i> Shakspere&rsquo;s) career would it be possible to
point out that time could be found for the interposition of a
legal employment in the chambers or offices of practising
lawyers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stratfordians, as is well known, casting about for some
possible explanation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s extraordinary
knowledge of law, have made the suggestion that Shakespeare
might, conceivably, have been a clerk in an attorney&rsquo;s
office before he came to London.&nbsp; Mr. Collier wrote to Lord
Campbell to ask his opinion as to the probability of this being
true.&nbsp; His answer was as follows: &ldquo;You require us to
believe implicitly a fact, of which, if true, positive and
irrefragable evidence in his own handwriting might have been
forthcoming to establish it.&nbsp; Not having been actually
enrolled as an attorney, neither the records of the local court
at Stratford nor of the superior Courts at Westminster would
present his name as being concerned in any suit as an attorney,
but it might reasonably have been expected that there would be
deeds or wills witnessed by him still extant, and after a very
diligent search none such can be discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this Lord Penzance comments: &ldquo;It cannot be doubted
that Lord Campbell was right in this.&nbsp; No young man could
have been at work in an attorney&rsquo;s office without being
called upon continually to act as a witness, and in many other
ways leaving traces of his work and name.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is
not a single fact or incident in all that is known of
Shakespeare, even by rumor or tradition, which supports this
notion of a clerkship.&nbsp; And after much argument and surmise
which has been indulged in on this subject, we may, I think,
safely put the notion on one side, for no less an authority than
Mr. Grant White says finally that the idea of his having been
clerk to an attorney has been &ldquo;blown to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is altogether characteristic of Mr. Churton Collins that
he, nevertheless, adopts this exploded myth.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
Shakespeare was in early life employed as a clerk in an
attorney&rsquo;s office, may be correct.&nbsp; At Stratford there
was by royal charter a Court of Record sitting every fortnight,
with six attorneys, beside the town clerk, belonging to it, and
it is certainly not straining probability to suppose that the
young Shakespeare may have had employment in one of them.&nbsp;
There is, it is true, no tradition to this effect, but such
traditions as we have about Shakespeare&rsquo;s occupation
between the time of leaving school and going to London are so
loose and baseless that no confidence can be placed in
them.&nbsp; It is, to say the least, more probable that he was in
an attorney&rsquo;s office than that he was a butcher killing
calves &lsquo;in a high style,&rsquo; and making speeches over
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a charming specimen of Stratfordian argument.&nbsp;
There is, as we have seen, a very old tradition that Shakespeare
was a butcher&rsquo;s apprentice.&nbsp; John Dowdall, who made a
tour in Warwickshire in 1693, testifies to it as coming from the
old clerk who showed him over the church, and it is
unhesitatingly accepted as true by Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps.&nbsp;
(Vol I, p. 11, and see Vol. II, p. 71, 72.)&nbsp; Mr. Sidney Lee
sees nothing improbable in it, and it is supported by Aubrey, who
must have written his account some time before 1680, when his
manuscript was completed.&nbsp; Of the attorney&rsquo;s clerk
hypothesis, on the other hand, there is not the faintest vestige
of a tradition.&nbsp; It has been evolved out of the fertile
imaginations of embarrassed Stratfordians, seeking for some
explanation of the Stratford rustic&rsquo;s marvellous
acquaintance with law and legal terms and legal life.&nbsp; But
Mr. Churton Collins has not the least hesitation in throwing over
the tradition which has the warrant of antiquity and setting up
in its stead this ridiculous invention, for which not only is
there no shred of positive evidence, but which, as Lord Campbell
and Lord Penzance point out, is really put out of court by the
negative evidence, since &ldquo;no young man could have been at
work in an attorney&rsquo;s office without being called upon
continually to act as a witness, and in many other ways leaving
traces of his work and name.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as Mr. Edwards
further points out, since the day when Lord Campbell&rsquo;s book
was published (between forty and fifty years ago), &ldquo;every
old deed or will, to say nothing of other legal papers, dated
during the period of William Shakespeare&rsquo;s youth, has been
scrutinized over half a dozen shires, and not one signature of
the young man has been found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, if Shakespeare had served as clerk in an
attorney&rsquo;s office it is clear that he must have so served
for a considerable period in order to have gained (if indeed it
is credible that he could have so gained) his remarkable
knowledge of law.&nbsp; Can we then for a moment believe that, if
this had been so, tradition would have been absolutely silent on
the matter?&nbsp; That Dowdall&rsquo;s old clerk, over eighty
years of age, should have never heard of it (though he was sure
enough about the butcher&rsquo;s apprentice), and that all the
other ancient witnesses should be in similar ignorance!</p>
<p>But such are the methods of Stratfordian controversy.&nbsp;
Tradition is to be scouted when it is found inconvenient, but
cited as irrefragable truth when it suits the case.&nbsp;
Shakespeare of Stratford was the author of the <i>Plays</i> and
<i>Poems</i>, but the author of the <i>Plays</i> and <i>Poems</i>
could not have been a butcher&rsquo;s apprentice.&nbsp; Away,
therefore, with tradition.&nbsp; But the author of the
<i>Plays</i> and <i>Poems must</i> have had a very large and a
very accurate knowledge of the law.&nbsp; Therefore, Shakespeare
of Stratford must have been an attorney&rsquo;s clerk!&nbsp; The
method is simplicity itself.&nbsp; By similar reasoning
Shakespeare has been made a country schoolmaster, a soldier, a
physician, a printer, and a good many other things beside,
according to the inclination and the exigencies of the
commentator.&nbsp; It would not be in the least surprising to
find that he was studying Latin as a schoolmaster and law in an
attorney&rsquo;s office at the same time.</p>
<p>However, we must do Mr. Collins the justice of saying that he
has fully recognized, what is indeed tolerably obvious, that
Shakespeare must have had a sound legal training.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
may, of course, be urged,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s knowledge of medicine, and particularly that
branch of it which related to morbid psychology, is equally
remarkable, and that no one has ever contended that he was a
physician.&nbsp; (Here Mr. Collins is wrong; that contention also
has been put forward.) It may be urged that his acquaintance with
the technicalities of other crafts and callings, notably of
marine and military affairs, was also extraordinary, and yet no
one has suspected him of being a sailor or a soldier.&nbsp;
(Wrong again.&nbsp; Why even Messrs. Garnett and Gosse
&lsquo;suspect&rsquo; that he was a soldier!)&nbsp; This may be
conceded, but the concession hardly furnishes an analogy.&nbsp;
To these and all other subjects he recurs occasionally, and in
season, but with reminiscences of the law his memory, as is
abundantly clear, was simply saturated.&nbsp; In season and out
of season now in manifest, now in recondite application, he
presses it into the service of expression and illustration.&nbsp;
At least a third of his myriad metaphors are derived from
it.&nbsp; It would indeed be difficult to find a single act in
any of his dramas, nay, in some of them, a single scene, the
diction and imagery of which is not colored by it.&nbsp; Much of
his law may have been acquired from three books easily accessible
to him, namely Tottell&rsquo;s <i>Precedents</i> (1572),
Pulton&rsquo;s <i>Statutes</i> (1578), and Fraunce&rsquo;s
<i>Lawier&rsquo;s Logike</i> (1588), works with which he
certainly seems to have been familiar; but much of it could only
have come from one who had an intimate acquaintance with legal
proceedings.&nbsp; We quite agree with Mr. Castle that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s legal knowledge is not what could have been
picked up in an attorney&rsquo;s office, but could only have been
learned by an actual attendance at the Courts, at a
Pleader&rsquo;s Chambers, and on circuit, or by associating
intimately with members of the Bench and Bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is excellent.&nbsp; But what is Mr. Collins&rsquo;
explanation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps the simplest solution of the
problem is to accept the hypothesis that in early life he was in
an attorney&rsquo;s office (!), that he there contracted a love
for the law which never left him, that as a young man in London,
he continued to study or dabble in it for his amusement, to
stroll in leisure hours into the Courts, and to frequent the
society of lawyers.&nbsp; On no other supposition is it possible
to explain the attraction which the law evidently had for him,
and his minute and undeviating accuracy in a subject where no
layman who has indulged in such copious and ostentatious display
of legal technicalities has ever yet succeeded in keeping himself
from tripping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lame conclusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;No other supposition&rdquo;
indeed!&nbsp; Yes, there is another, and a very obvious
supposition, namely, that Shakespeare was himself a lawyer, well
versed in his trade, versed in all the ways of the courts, and
living in close intimacy with judges and members of the Inns of
Court.</p>
<p>One is, of course, thankful that Mr. Collins has appreciated
the fact that Shakespeare must have had a sound legal training,
but I may be forgiven if I do not attach quite so much importance
to his pronouncements on this branch of the subject as to those
of Malone, Lord Campbell, Judge Holmes, Mr. Castle, K.C., Lord
Penzance, Mr. Grant White, and other lawyers, who have expressed
their opinion on the matter of Shakespeare&rsquo;s legal
acquirements.</p>
<p>Here it may, perhaps, be worth while to quote again from Lord
Penzance&rsquo;s book as to the suggestion that Shakespeare had
somehow or other managed &ldquo;to acquire a perfect familiarity
with legal principles, and an accurate and ready use of the
technical terms and phrases, not only of the conveyancer&rsquo;s
office, but of the pleader&rsquo;s chambers and the courts at
Westminster.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, as Lord Penzance points out,
&ldquo;would require nothing short of employment in some career
involving <i>constant contact</i> with legal questions and
general legal work.&rdquo;&nbsp; But &ldquo;in what portion of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s career would it be possible to point out that
time could be found for the interposition of a legal employment
in the chambers or offices of practising lawyers? . . . It is
beyond doubt that at an early period he was called upon to
abandon his attendance at school and assist his father, and was
soon after, at the age of sixteen, bound apprentice to a
trade.&nbsp; While under the obligation of this bond he could not
have pursued any other employment.&nbsp; Then he leaves Stratford
and comes to London.&nbsp; He has to provide himself with the
means of a livelihood, and this he did in some capacity at the
theatre.&nbsp; No one doubts that.&nbsp; The holding of horses is
scouted by many, and perhaps with justice, as being unlikely and
certainly unproved; but whatever the nature of his employment was
at the theatre, there is hardly room for the belief that it could
have been other than continuous, for his progress there was so
rapid.&nbsp; Ere long he had been taken into the company as an
actor, and was soon spoken of as a &lsquo;Johannes
Factotum.&rsquo;&nbsp; His rapid accumulation of wealth speaks
volumes for the constancy and activity of his services.&nbsp; One
fails to see when there could be a break in the current of his
life at this period of it, giving room or opportunity for legal
or indeed any other employment.&nbsp; &lsquo;In 1589,&rsquo; says
Knight, &lsquo;we have undeniable evidence that he had not only a
casual engagement, was not only a salaried servant, as many
players were, but was a shareholder in the company of the
Queen&rsquo;s players with other shareholders below him on the
list.&rsquo;&nbsp; This (1589) would be within two years after
his arrival in London, which is placed by White and
Halliwell-Phillipps about the year 1587.&nbsp; The difficulty in
supposing that, starting with a state of ignorance in 1587, when
he is supposed to have come to London, he was induced to enter
upon a course of most extended study and mental culture, is
almost insuperable.&nbsp; Still it was physically possible,
provided always that he could have had access to the needful
books.&nbsp; But this legal training seems to me to stand on a
different footing.&nbsp; It is not only unaccountable and
incredible, but it is actually negatived by the known facts of
his career.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Penzance then refers to the fact
that &ldquo;by 1592 (according to the best authority, Mr. Grant
White) several of the plays had been written.&nbsp; <i>The Comedy
of Errors</i> in 1589, <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i> in
1589, <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i> in 1589 or 1590, and so
forth,&rdquo; and then asks, &ldquo;with this catalogue of
dramatic work on hand . . . was it possible that he could have
taken a leading part in the management and conduct of two
theatres, and if Mr. Phillipps is to be relied upon, taken his
share in the performances of the provincial tours of his
company&mdash;and at the same time devoted himself to the study
of the law in all its branches so efficiently as to make himself
complete master of its principles and practice, and saturate his
mind with all its most technical terms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have cited this passage from Lord Penzance&rsquo;s book,
because it lay before me, and I had already quoted from it on the
matter of Shakespeare&rsquo;s legal knowledge; but other writers
have still better set forth the insuperable difficulties, as they
seem to me, which beset the idea that Shakespeare might have
found time in some unknown period of early life, amid
multifarious other occupations, for the study of classics,
literature and law, to say nothing of languages and a few other
matters.&nbsp; Lord Penzance further asks his readers: &ldquo;Did
you ever meet with or hear of an instance in which a young man in
this country gave himself up to legal studies and engaged in
legal employments, which is the only way of becoming familiar
with the technicalities of practice, unless with the view of
practicing in that profession?&nbsp; I do not believe that it
would be easy, or indeed possible, to produce an instance in
which the law has been seriously studied in all its branches,
except as a qualification for practice in the legal
profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>This testimony is so strong, so direct, so authoritative; and
so uncheapened, unwatered by guesses, and surmises, and
maybe-so&rsquo;s, and might-have-beens, and could-have-beens, and
must-have-beens, and the rest of that ton of plaster of paris out
of which the biographers have built the colossal brontosaur which
goes by the Stratford actor&rsquo;s name, that it quite convinces
me that the man who wrote Shakespeare&rsquo;s Works knew all
about law and lawyers.&nbsp; Also, that that man could not have
been the Stratford Shakespeare&mdash;and <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i>.</p>
<p>Who did write these Works, then?</p>
<p>I wish I knew.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>Did Francis Bacon write Shakespeare&rsquo;s Works?</p>
<p>Nobody knows.</p>
<p>We cannot say we <i>know</i> a thing when that thing has not
been proved.&nbsp; <i>Know</i> is too strong a word to use when
the evidence is not final and absolutely conclusive.&nbsp; We can
infer, if we want to, like those slaves . . . No, I will not
write that word, it is not kind, it is not courteous.&nbsp; The
upholders of the Stratford-Shakespeare superstition call
<i>us</i> the hardest names they can think of, and they keep
doing it all the time; very well, if they like to descend to that
level, let them do it, but I will not so undignify myself as to
follow them.&nbsp; I cannot call them harsh names; the most I can
do is to indicate them by terms reflecting my disapproval; and
this without malice, without venom.</p>
<p>To resume.&nbsp; What I was about to say, was, those thugs
have built their entire superstition upon <i>inferences</i>, not
upon known and established facts.&nbsp; It is a weak method, and
poor, and I am glad to be able to say our side never resorts to
it while there is anything else to resort to.</p>
<p>But when we must, we must; and we have now arrived at a place
of that sort.</p>
<p>Since the Stratford Shakespeare couldn&rsquo;t have written
the Works, we infer that somebody did.&nbsp; Who was it,
then?&nbsp; This requires some more inferring.</p>
<p>Ordinarily when an unsigned poem sweeps across the continent
like a tidal wave, whose roar and boom and thunder are made up of
admiration, delight and applause, a dozen obscure people rise up
and claim the authorship.&nbsp; Why a dozen, instead of only one
or two?&nbsp; One reason is, because there&rsquo;s a dozen that
are recognizably competent to do that poem.&nbsp; Do you remember
&ldquo;Beautiful Snow&rdquo;?&nbsp; Do you remember &ldquo;Rock
Me to Sleep, Mother, Rock Me to Sleep&rdquo;?&nbsp; Do you
remember &ldquo;Backward, turn backward, O Time, in thy
flight!&nbsp; Make me a child again just for
to-night&rdquo;?&nbsp; I remember them very well.&nbsp; Their
authorship was claimed by most of the grown-up people who were
alive at the time, and every claimant had one plausible argument
in his favor, at least: to wit, he could have done the authoring;
he was competent.</p>
<p>Have the Works been claimed by a dozen?&nbsp; They
haven&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There was good reason.&nbsp; The world knows
there was but one man on the planet at the time who was
competent&mdash;not a dozen, and not two.&nbsp; A long time ago
the dwellers in a far country used now and then to find a
procession of prodigious footprints stretching across the
plain&mdash;footprints that were three miles apart, each
footprint a third of a mile long and a furlong deep, and with
forests and villages mashed to mush in it.&nbsp; Was there any
doubt as to who had made that mighty trail?&nbsp; Were there a
dozen claimants?&nbsp; Were there two?&nbsp; No&mdash;the people
knew who it was that had been along there: there was only one
Hercules.</p>
<p>There has been only one Shakespeare.&nbsp; There
couldn&rsquo;t be two; certainly there couldn&rsquo;t be two at
the same time.&nbsp; It takes ages to bring forth a Shakespeare,
and some more ages to match him.&nbsp; This one was not matched
before his time; nor during his time; and hasn&rsquo;t been
matched since.&nbsp; The prospect of matching him in our time is
not bright.</p>
<p>The Baconians claim that the Stratford Shakespeare was not
qualified to write the Works, and that Francis Bacon was.&nbsp;
They claim that Bacon possessed the stupendous
equipment&mdash;both natural and acquired&mdash;for the miracle;
and that no other Englishman of his day possessed the like; or,
indeed, anything closely approaching it.</p>
<p>Macaulay, in his Essay, has much to say about the splendor and
horizonless magnitude of that equipment.&nbsp; Also, he has
synopsized Bacon&rsquo;s history: a thing which cannot be done
for the Stratford Shakespeare, for he hasn&rsquo;t any history to
synopsize.&nbsp; Bacon&rsquo;s history is open to the world, from
his boyhood to his death in old age&mdash;a history consisting of
known facts, displayed in minute and multitudinous detail;
<i>facts</i>, not guesses and conjectures and
might-have-beens.</p>
<p>Whereby it appears that he was born of a race of statesmen,
and had a Lord Chancellor for his father, and a mother who was
&ldquo;distinguished both as a linguist and a theologian: she
corresponded in Greek with Bishop Jewell, and translated his
<i>Apologia</i> from the Latin so correctly that neither he nor
Archbishop Parker could suggest a single alteration.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is the atmosphere we are reared in that determines how our
inclinations and aspirations shall tend.&nbsp; The atmosphere
furnished by the parents to the son in this present case was an
atmosphere saturated with learning; with thinkings and ponderings
upon deep subjects; and with polite culture.&nbsp; It had its
natural effect.&nbsp; Shakespeare of Stratford was reared in a
house which had no use for books, since its owners, his parents,
were without education.&nbsp; This may have had an effect upon
the son, but we do not know, because we have no history of him of
an informing sort.&nbsp; There were but few books anywhere, in
that day, and only the well-to-do and highly educated possessed
them, they being almost confined to the dead languages.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All the valuable books then extant in all the vernacular
dialects of Europe would hardly have filled a single
shelf&rdquo;&mdash;imagine it!&nbsp; The few existing books were
in the Latin tongue mainly.&nbsp; &ldquo;A person who was
ignorant of it was shut out from all acquaintance&mdash;not
merely with Cicero and Virgil, but with the most interesting
memoirs, state papers, and pamphlets of his own
time&rdquo;&mdash;a literature necessary to the Stratford lad,
for his fictitious reputation&rsquo;s sake, since the writer of
his Works would begin to use it wholesale and in a most masterly
way before the lad was hardly more than out of his teens and into
his twenties.</p>
<p>At fifteen Bacon was sent to the university, and he spent
three years there.&nbsp; Thence he went to Paris in the train of
the English Ambassador, and there he mingled daily with the wise,
the cultured, the great, and the aristocracy of fashion, during
another three years.&nbsp; A total of six years spent at the
sources of knowledge; knowledge both of books and of men.&nbsp;
The three spent at the university were coeval with the second and
last three spent by the little Stratford lad at Stratford school
supposedly, and perhapsedly, and maybe, and by
inference&mdash;with nothing to infer from.&nbsp; The second
three of the Baconian six were &ldquo;presumably&rdquo; spent by
the Stratford lad as apprentice to a butcher.&nbsp; That is, the
thugs presume it&mdash;on no evidence of any kind.&nbsp; Which is
their way, when they want a historical fact.&nbsp; Fact and
presumption are, for business purposes, all the same to
them.&nbsp; They know the difference, but they also know how to
blink it.&nbsp; They know, too, that while in history-building a
fact is better than a presumption, it doesn&rsquo;t take a
presumption long to bloom into a fact when <i>they</i> have the
handling of it.&nbsp; They know by old experience that when they
get hold of a presumption-tadpole he is not going to <i>stay</i>
tadpole in their history-tank; no, they know how to develop him
into the giant four-legged bullfrog of <i>fact</i>, and make him
sit up on his hams, and puff out his chin, and look important and
insolent and come-to-stay; and assert his genuine simon-pure
authenticity with a thundering bellow that will convince
everybody because it is so loud.&nbsp; The thug is aware that
loudness convinces sixty persons where reasoning convinces but
one.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t be a thug, not even if&mdash;but
never mind about that, it has nothing to do with the argument,
and it is not noble in spirit besides.&nbsp; If I am better than
a thug, is the merit mine?&nbsp; No, it is His.&nbsp; Then to Him
be the praise.&nbsp; That is the right spirit.</p>
<p>They &ldquo;presume&rdquo; the lad severed his
&ldquo;presumed&rdquo; connection with the Stratford school to
become apprentice to a butcher.&nbsp; They also
&ldquo;presume&rdquo; that the butcher was his father.&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; There is no written record of it, nor any
other actual evidence.&nbsp; If it would have helped their case
any, they would have apprenticed him to thirty butchers, to fifty
butchers, to a wilderness of butchers&mdash;all by their patented
method &ldquo;presumption.&rdquo;&nbsp; If it will help their
case they will do it yet; and if it will further help it, they
will &ldquo;presume&rdquo; that all those butchers were his
father.&nbsp; And the week after, they will <i>say</i> it.&nbsp;
Why, it is just like being the past tense of the compound
reflexive adverbial incandescent hypodermic irregular accusative
Noun of Multitude; which is father to the expression which the
grammarians call Verb.&nbsp; It is like a whole ancestry, with
only one posterity.</p>
<p>To resume.&nbsp; Next, the young Bacon took up the study of
law, and mastered that abstruse science.&nbsp; From that day to
the end of his life he was daily in close contact with lawyers
and judges; not as a casual onlooker in intervals between holding
horses in front of a theatre, but as a practicing lawyer&mdash;a
great and successful one, a renowned one, a Launcelot of the bar,
the most formidable lance in the high brotherhood of the legal
Table Round; he lived in the law&rsquo;s atmosphere thenceforth,
all his years, and by sheer ability forced his way up its
difficult steeps to its supremest summit, the Lord
Chancellorship, leaving behind him no fellow craftsman qualified
to challenge his divine right to that majestic place.</p>
<p>When we read the praises bestowed by Lord Penzance and the
other illustrious experts upon the legal condition and legal
aptnesses, brilliances, profundities and felicities so prodigally
displayed in the Plays, and try to fit them to the history-less
Stratford stage-manager, they sound wild, strange, incredible,
ludicrous; but when we put them in the mouth of Bacon they do not
sound strange, they seem in their natural and rightful place,
they seem at home there.&nbsp; Please turn back and read them
again.&nbsp; Attributed to Shakespeare of Stratford they are
meaningless, they are inebriate extravagancies&mdash;intemperate
admirations of the dark side of the moon, so to speak; attributed
to Bacon, they are admirations of the golden glories of the
moon&rsquo;s front side, the moon at the full&mdash;and not
intemperate, not overwrought, but sane and right, and
justified.&nbsp; &ldquo;At every turn and point at which the
author required a metaphor, simile or illustration, his mind ever
turned <i>first</i> to the law; he seems almost to have
<i>thought</i> in legal phrases; the commonest legal phrases, the
commonest of legal expressions were ever at the end of his
pen.&rdquo;&nbsp; That could happen to no one but a person whose
<i>trade</i> was the law; it could not happen to a dabbler in
it.&nbsp; Veteran mariners fill their conversation with
sailor-phrases and draw all their similes from the ship and the
sea and the storm, but no mere <i>passenger</i> ever does it, be
he of Stratford or elsewhere; or could do it with anything
resembling accuracy, if he were hardy enough to try.&nbsp; Please
read again what Lord Campbell and the other great authorities
have said about Bacon when they thought they were saying it about
Shakespeare of Stratford.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X&mdash;The Rest of the Equipment</h2>
<p>The author of the Plays was equipped, beyond every other man
of his time, with wisdom, erudition, imagination, capaciousness
of mind, grace and majesty of expression.&nbsp; Every one has
said it, no one doubts it.&nbsp; Also, he had humor, humor in
rich abundance, and always wanting to break out.&nbsp; We have no
evidence of any kind that Shakespeare of Stratford possessed any
of these gifts or any of these acquirements.&nbsp; The only lines
he ever wrote, so far as we know, are substantially barren of
them&mdash;barren of all of them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare<br />
To digg the dust encloased heare:<br />
Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones<br />
And curst be he yt moves my bones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ben Jonson says of Bacon, as orator:</p>
<blockquote><p>His language, <i>where he could spare and pass by
a jest</i>, was nobly censorious.&nbsp; No man ever spoke more
neatly, more pressly, more weightily, or suffered less emptiness,
less idleness, in what he uttered.&nbsp; No member of his speech
but consisted of his (its) own graces . . . The fear of every man
that heard him was lest he should make an end.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Macaulay:</p>
<blockquote><p>He continued to distinguish himself in Parliament,
particularly by his exertions in favor of one excellent measure
on which the King&rsquo;s heart was set&mdash;the union of
England and Scotland.&nbsp; It was not difficult for such an
intellect to discover many irresistible arguments in favor of
such a scheme.&nbsp; He conducted the great case of the <i>Post
Nati</i> in the Exchequer Chamber; and the decision of the
judges&mdash;a decision the legality of which may be questioned,
but the beneficial effect of which must be acknowledged&mdash;was
in a great measure attributed to his dexterous management.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:</p>
<blockquote><p>While actively engaged in the House of Commons and
in the courts of law, he still found leisure for letters and
philosophy.&nbsp; The noble treatise on the <i>Advancement of
Learning</i>, which at a later period was expanded into the <i>De
Augmentis</i>, appeared in 1605.</p>
<p>The <i>Wisdom of the Ancients</i>, a work which if it had
proceeded from any other writer would have been considered as a
masterpiece of wit and learning, was printed in 1609.</p>
<p>In the meantime the <i>Novum Organum</i> was slowly
proceeding.&nbsp; Several distinguished men of learning had been
permitted to see portions of that extraordinary book, and they
spoke with the greatest admiration of his genius.</p>
<p>Even Sir Thomas Bodley, after perusing the <i>Cogitata et
Visa</i>, one of the most precious of those scattered leaves out
of which the great oracular volume was afterward made up,
acknowledged that &ldquo;in all proposals and plots in that book,
Bacon showed himself a master workman&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;it
could not be gainsaid but all the treatise over did abound with
choice conceits of the present state of learning, and with worthy
contemplations of the means to procure it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1612 a new edition of the <i>Essays</i> appeared, with
additions surpassing the original collection both in bulk and
quality.</p>
<p>Nor did these pursuits distract Bacon&rsquo;s attention from a
work the most arduous, the most glorious, and the most useful
that even his mighty powers could have achieved, &ldquo;the
reducing and recompiling,&rdquo; to use his own phrase, &ldquo;of
the laws of England.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To serve the exacting and laborious offices of Attorney
General and Solicitor General would have satisfied the appetite
of any other man for hard work, but Bacon had to add the vast
literary industries just described, to satisfy his.&nbsp; He was
a born worker.</p>
<blockquote><p>The service which he rendered to letters during
the last five years of his life, amid ten thousand distractions
and vexations, increase the regret with which we think on the
many years which he had wasted, to use the words of Sir Thomas
Bodley, &ldquo;on such study as was not worthy such a
student.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He commenced a digest of the laws of England, a History of
England under the Princes of the House of Tudor, a body of
National History, a Philosophical Romance.&nbsp; He made
extensive and valuable additions to his Essays.&nbsp; He
published the inestimable <i>Treatise De Argumentis
Scientiarum</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did these labors of Hercules fill up his time to his
contentment, and quiet his appetite for work?&nbsp; Not
entirely:</p>
<blockquote><p>The trifles with which he amused himself in hours
of pain and languor bore the mark of his mind.&nbsp; <i>The best
jestbook in the world</i> is that which he dictated from memory,
without referring to any book, on a day on which illness had
rendered him incapable of serious study.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some scattered remarks (from Macaulay) which throw
light upon Bacon, and seem to indicate&mdash;and maybe
demonstrate&mdash;that he was competent to write the Plays and
Poems:</p>
<blockquote><p>With great minuteness of observation he had an
amplitude of comprehension such as has never yet been vouchsafed
to any other human being.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Essays&rdquo; contain abundant proofs that no nice
feature of character, no peculiarity in the ordering of a house,
a garden or a court-masque, could escape the notice of one whose
mind was capable of taking in the whole world of knowledge.</p>
<p>His understanding resembled the tent which the fairy Paribanou
gave to Prince Ahmed: fold it, and it seemed a toy for the hand
of a lady; spread it, and the armies of powerful Sultans might
repose beneath its shade.</p>
<p>The knowledge in which Bacon excelled all men was a knowledge
of the mutual relations of all departments of knowledge.</p>
<p>In a letter written when he was only thirty-one, to his uncle,
Lord Burleigh, he said, &ldquo;I have taken all knowledge to be
my province.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though Bacon did not arm his philosophy with the weapons of
logic, he adorned her profusely with all the richest decorations
of rhetoric.</p>
<p>The practical faculty was powerful in Bacon; but not, like his
wit, so powerful as occasionally to usurp the place of his
reason, and to tyrannize over the whole man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are too many places in the Plays where this
happens.&nbsp; Poor old dying John of Gaunt volleying second-rate
puns at his own name, is a pathetic instance of it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We may assume&rdquo; that it is Bacon&rsquo;s fault, but
the Stratford Shakespeare has to bear the blame.</p>
<blockquote><p>No imagination was ever at once so strong and so
thoroughly subjugated.&nbsp; It stopped at the first check from
good sense.</p>
<p>In truth much of Bacon&rsquo;s life was passed in a visionary
world&mdash;amid things as strange as any that are described in
the &ldquo;Arabian Tales&rdquo; . . . amid buildings more
sumptuous than the palace of Aladdin, fountains more wonderful
than the golden water of Parizade, conveyances more rapid than
the hippogryph of Ruggiero, arms more formidable than the lance
of Astolfo, remedies more efficacious than the balsam of
Fierabras.&nbsp; Yet in his magnificent day-dreams there was
nothing wild&mdash;nothing but what sober reason sanctioned.</p>
<p>Bacon&rsquo;s greatest performance is the first book of the
<i>Novum Organum</i> . . . Every part of it blazes with wit, but
with wit which is employed only to illustrate and decorate
truth.&nbsp; No book ever made so great a revolution in the mode
of thinking, overthrew so many prejudices, introduced so many new
opinions.</p>
<p>But what we most admire is the vast capacity of that intellect
which, without effort, takes in at once all the domains of
science&mdash;all the past, the present and the future, all the
errors of two thousand years, all the encouraging signs of the
passing times, all the bright hopes of the coming age.</p>
<p>He had a wonderful talent for packing thought close and
rendering it portable.</p>
<p>His eloquence would alone have entitled him to a high rank in
literature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident that he had each and every one of the mental
gifts and each and every one of the acquirements that are so
prodigally displayed in the Plays and Poems, and in much higher
and richer degree than any other man of his time or of any
previous time.&nbsp; He was a genius without a mate, a prodigy
not matable.&nbsp; There was only one of him; the planet could
not produce two of him at one birth, nor in one age.&nbsp; He
could have written anything that is in the Plays and Poems.&nbsp;
He could have written this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The cloud-cap&rsquo;d towers, the gorgeous
palaces,<br />
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,<br />
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,<br />
And, like an insubstantial pageant faded,<br />
Leave not a rack behind.&nbsp; We are such stuff<br />
As dreams are made on, and our little life<br />
Is rounded with a sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, he could have written this, but he refrained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare<br />
To digg the dust encloased heare:<br />
Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones<br />
And curst be ye yt moves my bones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a person reads the noble verses about the
cloud-cap&rsquo;d towers, he ought not to follow it immediately
with Good friend for Iesus sake forbeare, because he will find
the transition from great poetry to poor prose too violent for
comfort.&nbsp; It will give him a shock.&nbsp; You never notice
how commonplace and unpoetic gravel is, until you bite into a
layer of it in a pie.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>Am I trying to convince anybody that Shakespeare did not write
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Works?&nbsp; Ah, now, what do you take me
for?&nbsp; Would I be so soft as that, after having known the
human race familiarly for nearly seventy-four years?&nbsp; It
would grieve me to know that any one could think so injuriously
of me, so uncomplimentarily, so unadmiringly of me.&nbsp; No-no,
I am aware that when even the brightest mind in our world has
been trained up from childhood in a superstition of any kind, it
will never be possible for that mind, in its maturity, to examine
sincerely, dispassionately, and conscientiously any evidence or
any circumstance which shall seem to cast a doubt upon the
validity of that superstition.&nbsp; I doubt if I could do it
myself.&nbsp; We always get at second hand our notions about
systems of government; and high-tariff and low-tariff; and
prohibition and anti-prohibition; and the holiness of peace and
the glories of war; and codes of honor and codes of morals; and
approval of the duel and disapproval of it; and our beliefs
concerning the nature of cats; and our ideas as to whether the
murder of helpless wild animals is base or is heroic; and our
preferences in the matter of religious and political parties; and
our acceptance or rejection of the Shakespeares and the Arthur
Ortons and the Mrs. Eddys.&nbsp; We get them all at second-hand,
we reason none of them out for ourselves.&nbsp; It is the way we
are made.&nbsp; It is the way we are all made, and we can&rsquo;t
help it, we can&rsquo;t change it.&nbsp; And whenever we have
been furnished a fetish, and have been taught to believe in it,
and love it and worship it, and refrain from examining it, there
is no evidence, howsoever clear and strong, that can persuade us
to withdraw from it our loyalty and our devotion.&nbsp; In
morals, conduct, and beliefs we take the color of our environment
and associations, and it is a color that can safely be warranted
to wash.&nbsp; Whenever we have been furnished with a tar baby
ostensibly stuffed with jewels, and warned that it will be
dishonorable and irreverent to disembowel it and test the jewels,
we keep our sacrilegious hands off it.&nbsp; We submit, not
reluctantly, but rather gladly, for we are privately afraid we
should find, upon examination, that the jewels are of the sort
that are manufactured at North Adams, Mass.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t any idea that Shakespeare will have to vacate
his pedestal this side of the year 2209.&nbsp; Disbelief in him
cannot come swiftly, disbelief in a healthy and deeply-loved tar
baby has never been known to disintegrate swiftly, it is a very
slow process.&nbsp; It took several thousand years to convince
our fine race&mdash;including every splendid intellect in
it&mdash;that there is no such thing as a witch; it has taken
several thousand years to convince that same fine
race&mdash;including every splendid intellect in it&mdash;that
there is no such person as Satan; it has taken several centuries
to remove perdition from the Protestant Church&rsquo;s program of
postmortem entertainments; it has taken a weary long time to
persuade American Presbyterians to give up infant damnation and
try to bear it the best they can; and it looks as if their Scotch
brethren will still be burning babies in the everlasting fires
when Shakespeare comes down from his perch.</p>
<p>We are The Reasoning Race.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t prove it by
the above examples, and we can&rsquo;t prove it by the miraculous
&ldquo;histories&rdquo; built by those Stratfordolaters out of a
hatful of rags and a barrel of sawdust, but there is a plenty of
other things we can prove it by, if I could think of them.&nbsp;
We are The Reasoning Race, and when we find a vague file of
chipmunk-tracks stringing through the dust of Stratford village,
we know by our reasoning powers that Hercules has been along
there.&nbsp; I feel that our fetish is safe for three centuries
yet.&nbsp; The bust, too&mdash;there in the Stratford
Church.&nbsp; The precious bust, the priceless bust, the calm
bust, the serene bust, the emotionless bust, with the dandy
moustache, and the putty face, unseamed of care&mdash;that face
which has looked passionlessly down upon the awed pilgrim for a
hundred and fifty years and will still look down upon the awed
pilgrim three hundred more, with the deep, deep, deep, subtle,
subtle, subtle, expression of a bladder.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII&mdash;Irreverence</h2>
<p>One of the most trying defects which I find in
these&mdash;these&mdash;what shall I call them? for I will not
apply injurious epithets to them, the way they do to us, such
violations of courtesy being repugnant to my nature and my
dignity.&nbsp; The furthest I can go in that direction is to call
them by names of limited reverence&mdash;names merely
descriptive, never unkind, never offensive, never tainted by
harsh feeling.&nbsp; If <i>they</i> would do like this, they
would feel better in their hearts.&nbsp; Very well, then&mdash;to
proceed.&nbsp; One of the most trying defects which I find in
these Stratfordolaters, these Shakesperoids, these thugs, these
bangalores, these troglodytes, these herumfrodites, these
blatherskites, these buccaneers, these bandoleers, is their
spirit of irreverence.&nbsp; It is detectable in every utterance
of theirs when they are talking about us.&nbsp; I am thankful
that in me there is nothing of that spirit.&nbsp; When a thing is
sacred to me it is impossible for me to be irreverent toward
it.&nbsp; I cannot call to mind a single instance where I have
ever been irreverent, except toward the things which were sacred
to other people.&nbsp; Am I in the right?&nbsp; I think so.&nbsp;
But I ask no one to take my unsupported word; no, look at the
dictionary; let the dictionary decide.&nbsp; Here is the
definition:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Irreverence</i>.&nbsp; The quality or condition
of irreverence toward God and sacred things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What does the Hindu say?&nbsp; He says it is correct.&nbsp; He
says irreverence is lack of respect for Vishnu, and Brahma, and
Chrishna, and his other gods, and for his sacred cattle, and for
his temples and the things within them.&nbsp; He endorses the
definition, you see; and there are 300,000,000 Hindus or their
equivalents back of him.</p>
<p>The dictionary had the acute idea that by using the capital G
it could restrict irreverence to lack of reverence for <i>our</i>
Deity and our sacred things, but that ingenious and rather sly
idea miscarried: for by the simple process of spelling <i>his</i>
deities with capitals the Hindu confiscates the definition and
restricts it to his own sects, thus making it clearly compulsory
upon us to revere <i>his</i> gods and <i>his</i> sacred things,
and nobody&rsquo;s else.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t say a word, for he
has our own dictionary at his back, and its decision is
final.</p>
<p>This law, reduced to its simplest terms, is this: 1.&nbsp;
Whatever is sacred to the Christian must be held in reverence by
everybody else; 2, whatever is sacred to the Hindu must be held
in reverence by everybody else; 3, therefore, by consequence,
logically, and indisputably, whatever is sacred to <i>me</i> must
be held in reverence by everybody else.</p>
<p>Now then, what aggravates me is, that these troglodytes and
muscovites and bandoleers and buccaneers are <i>also</i> trying
to crowd in and share the benefit of the law, and compel
everybody to revere their Shakespeare and hold him sacred.&nbsp;
We can&rsquo;t have that: there&rsquo;s enough of us
already.&nbsp; If you go on widening and spreading and inflating
the privilege, it will presently come to be conceded that each
man&rsquo;s sacred things are the <i>only</i> ones, and the rest
of the human race will have to be humbly reverent toward them or
suffer for it.&nbsp; That can surely happen, and when it happens,
the word Irreverence will be regarded as the most meaningless,
and foolish, and self-conceited, and insolent, and impudent and
dictatorial word in the language.&nbsp; And people will say,
&ldquo;Whose business is it, what gods I worship and what things
hold sacred?&nbsp; Who has the right to dictate to my conscience,
and where did he get that right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We cannot afford to let that calamity come upon us.&nbsp; We
must save the word from this destruction.&nbsp; There is but one
way to do it, and that is, to stop the spread of the privilege,
and strictly confine it to its present limits: that is, to all
the Christian sects, to all the Hindu sects, and me.&nbsp; We do
not need any more, the stock is watered enough, just as it
is.</p>
<p>It would be better if the privilege were limited to me
alone.&nbsp; I think so because I am the only sect that knows how
to employ it gently, kindly, charitably, dispassionately.&nbsp;
The other sects lack the quality of self-restraint.&nbsp; The
Catholic Church says the most irreverent things about matters
which are sacred to the Protestants, and the Protestant Church
retorts in kind about the confessional and other matters which
Catholics hold sacred; then both of these irreverencers turn upon
Thomas Paine and charge <i>him</i> with irreverence.&nbsp; This
is all unfortunate, because it makes it difficult for students
equipped with only a low grade of mentality to find out what
Irreverence really <i>is</i>.</p>
<p>It will surely be much better all around if the privilege of
regulating the irreverent and keeping them in order shall
eventually be withdrawn from all the sects but me.&nbsp; Then
there will be no more quarrelling, no more bandying of
disrespectful epithets, no more heart burnings.</p>
<p>There will then be nothing sacred involved in this
Bacon-Shakespeare controversy except what is sacred to me.&nbsp;
That will simplify the whole matter, and trouble will
cease.&nbsp; There will be irreverence no longer, because I will
not allow it.&nbsp; The first time those criminals charge me with
irreverence for calling their Stratford myth an
Arthur-Orton-Mary-Baker-Thompson-Eddy-Louis-the-Seventeenth-Veiled-Prophet-of-Khorassan
will be the last.&nbsp; Taught by the methods found effective in
extinguishing earlier offenders by the Inquisition, of holy
memory, I shall know how to quiet them.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it odd, when you think of it: that you may list
all the celebrated Englishmen, Irishmen, and Scotchmen of modern
times, clear back to the first Tudors&mdash;a list containing
five hundred names, shall we say?&mdash;and you can go to the
histories, biographies and cyclopedias and learn the particulars
of the lives of every one of them.&nbsp; Every one of them except
one&mdash;the most famous, the most renowned&mdash;by far the
most illustrious of them all&mdash;Shakespeare!&nbsp; You can get
the details of the lives of all the celebrated ecclesiastics in
the list; all the celebrated tragedians, comedians, singers,
dancers, orators, judges, lawyers, poets, dramatists, historians,
biographers, editors, inventors, reformers, statesmen, generals,
admirals, discoverers, prize-fighters, murderers, pirates,
conspirators, horse-jockeys, bunco-steerers, misers, swindlers,
explorers, adventurers by land and sea, bankers, financiers,
astronomers, naturalists, Claimants, impostors, chemists,
biologists, geologists, philologists, college presidents and
professors, architects, engineers, painters, sculptors,
politicians, agitators, rebels, revolutionists, patriots,
demagogues, clowns, cooks, freaks, philosophers, burglars,
highwaymen, journalists, physicians, surgeons&mdash;you can get
the life-histories of all of them but <i>one</i>.&nbsp; Just
one&mdash;the most extraordinary and the most celebrated of them
all&mdash;Shakespeare!</p>
<p>You may add to the list the thousand celebrated persons
furnished by the rest of Christendom in the past four centuries,
and you can find out the life-histories of all those people,
too.&nbsp; You will then have listed 1500 celebrities, and you
can trace the authentic life-histories of the whole of
them.&nbsp; Save one&mdash;far and away the most colossal prodigy
of the entire accumulation&mdash;Shakespeare!&nbsp; About him you
can find out <i>nothing</i>.&nbsp; Nothing of even the slightest
importance.&nbsp; Nothing worth the trouble of stowing away in
your memory.&nbsp; Nothing that even remotely indicates that he
was ever anything more than a distinctly common-place
person&mdash;a manager, an actor of inferior grade, a small
trader in a small village that did not regard him as a person of
any consequence, and had forgotten all about him before he was
fairly cold in his grave.&nbsp; We can go to the records and find
out the life-history of every renowned <i>race-horse</i> of
modern times&mdash;but not Shakespeare&rsquo;s!&nbsp; There are
many reasons why, and they have been furnished in cartloads (of
guess and conjecture) by those troglodytes; but there is one that
is worth all the rest of the reasons put together, and is
abundantly sufficient all by itself&mdash;<i>he hadn&rsquo;t any
history to record</i>.&nbsp; There is no way of getting around
that deadly fact.&nbsp; And no sane way has yet been discovered
of getting around its formidable significance.</p>
<p>Its quite plain significance&mdash;to any but those thugs (I
do not use the term unkindly) is, that Shakespeare had no
prominence while he lived, and none until he had been dead two or
three generations.&nbsp; The Plays enjoyed high fame from the
beginning; and if he wrote them it seems a pity the world did not
find it out.&nbsp; He ought to have explained that he was the
author, and not merely a <i>nom de plume</i> for another man to
hide behind.&nbsp; If he had been less intemperately solicitous
about his bones, and more solicitous about his Works, it would
have been better for his good name, and a kindness to us.&nbsp;
The bones were not important.&nbsp; They will moulder away, they
will turn to dust, but the Works will endure until the last sun
goes down.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Mark
Twain</span>.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; <i>March</i> 25.&nbsp; About two months ago I was
illuminating this Autobiography with some notions of mine
concerning the Bacon-Shakespeare controversy, and I then took
occasion to air the opinion that the Stratford Shakespeare was a
person of no public consequence or celebrity during his lifetime,
but was utterly obscure and unimportant.&nbsp; And not only in
great London, but also in the little village where he was born,
where he lived a quarter of a century, and where he died and was
buried.&nbsp; I argued that if he had been a person of any note
at all, aged villagers would have had much to tell about him many
and many a year after his death, instead of being unable to
furnish inquirers a single fact connected with him.&nbsp; I
believed, and I still believe, that if he had been famous, his
notoriety would have lasted as long as mine has lasted in my
native village out in Missouri.&nbsp; It is a good argument, a
prodigiously strong one, and a most formidable one for even the
most gifted, and ingenious, and plausible Stratfordolater to get
around or explain away.&nbsp; To-day a Hannibal
<i>Courier-Post</i> of recent date has reached me, with an
article in it which reinforces my contention that a really
celebrated person cannot be forgotten in his village in the short
space of sixty years.&nbsp; I will make an extract from it:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hannibal, as a city, may have many sins to answer
for, but ingratitude is not one of them, or reverence for the
great men she has produced, and as the years go by her greatest
son Mark Twain, or S. L. Clemens as a few of the unlettered call
him, grows in the estimation and regard of the residents of the
town he made famous and the town that made him famous.&nbsp; His
name is associated with every old building that is torn down to
make way for the modern structures demanded by a rapidly growing
city, and with every hill or cave over or through which he might
by any possibility have roamed, while the many points of interest
which he wove into his stories, such as Holiday Hill,
Jackson&rsquo;s Island, or Mark Twain Cave, are now monuments to
his genius.&nbsp; Hannibal is glad of any opportunity to do him
honor as he has honored her.</p>
<p>So it has happened that the &ldquo;old timers&rdquo; who went
to school with Mark or were with him on some of his usual
escapades have been honored with large audiences whenever they
were in a reminiscent mood and condescended to tell of their
intimacy with the ordinary boy who came to be a very
extraordinary humorist and whose every boyish act is now seen to
have been indicative of what was to come.&nbsp; Like Aunt Beckey
and Mrs. Clemens, they can now see that Mark was hardly
appreciated when he lived here and that the things he did as a
boy and was whipped for doing were not all bad after all.&nbsp;
So they have been in no hesitancy about drawing out the bad
things he did as well as the good in their efforts to get a
&ldquo;Mark Twain story,&rdquo; all incidents being viewed in the
light of his present fame, until the volume of
&ldquo;Twainiana&rdquo; is already considerable and growing in
proportion as the &ldquo;old timers&rdquo; drop away and the
stories are retold second and third hand by their
descendants.&nbsp; With some seventy-three years young and living
in a villa instead of a house he is a fair target, and let him
incorporate, copyright, or patent himself as he will, there are
some of his &ldquo;works&rdquo; that will go swooping up Hannibal
chimneys as long as gray-beards gather about the fires and begin
with &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard father tell&rdquo; or possibly
&ldquo;Once when I.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Mrs. Clemens referred to is my mother&mdash;<i>was</i> my
mother.</p>
<p>And here is another extract from a Hannibal paper.&nbsp; Of
date twenty days ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>Miss Becca Blankenship died at the home of William
Dickason, 408 Rock Street, at 2.30 o&rsquo;clock yesterday
afternoon, aged 72 years.&nbsp; The deceased was a sister of
&ldquo;Huckleberry Finn,&rdquo; one of the famous characters in
Mark Twain&rsquo;s <i>Tom Sawyer</i>.&nbsp; She had been a member
of the Dickason family&mdash;the housekeeper&mdash;for nearly
forty-five years, and was a highly respected lady.&nbsp; For the
past eight years she had been an invalid, but was as well cared
for by Mr. Dickason and his family as if she had been a near
relative.&nbsp; She was a member of the Park Methodist Church and
a Christian woman.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember her well.&nbsp; I have a picture of her in my mind
which was graven there, clear and sharp and vivid, sixty-three
years ago.&nbsp; She was at that time nine years old, and I was
about eleven.&nbsp; I remember where she stood, and how she
looked; and I can still see her bare feet, her bare head, her
brown face, and her short tow-linen frock.&nbsp; She was
crying.&nbsp; What it was about, I have long ago forgotten.&nbsp;
But it was the tears that preserved the picture for me, no
doubt.&nbsp; She was a good child, I can say that for her.&nbsp;
She knew me nearly seventy years ago.&nbsp; Did she forget me, in
the course of time?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; If she had lived in
Stratford in Shakespeare&rsquo;s time, would she have forgotten
him?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; For he was never famous during his
lifetime, he was utterly obscure in Stratford, and there
wouldn&rsquo;t be any occasion to remember him after he had been
dead a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Injun Joe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jimmy Finn,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;General Gaines&rdquo; were prominent and very intemperate
ne&rsquo;er-do-weels in Hannibal two generations ago.&nbsp;
Plenty of gray-heads there remember them to this day, and can
tell you about them.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it curious that two
&ldquo;town-drunkards&rdquo; and one half-breed loafer should
leave behind them, in a remote Missourian village, a fame a
hundred times greater and several hundred times more
particularized in the matter of definite facts than Shakespeare
left behind him in the village where he had lived the half of his
lifetime?</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
