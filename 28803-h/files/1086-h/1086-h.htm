<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>Although I have had several opportunities to see a bull-fight,
I have never seen one; but I needed a bull-fight in this book,
and a trustworthy one will be found in it.&nbsp; I got it out of
John Hay&rsquo;s <i>Castilian Days</i>, reducing and condensing
it to fit the requirements of this small story.&nbsp; Mr. Hay and
I were friends from early times, and if he were still with us he
would not rebuke me for the liberty I have taken.</p>
<p>The knowledge of military minuti&aelig; exhibited in this book
will be found to be correct, but it is not mine; I took it from
<i>Army Regulations</i>, ed. 1904; <i>Hardy&rsquo;s
Tactics</i>&mdash;<i>Cavalry</i>, revised ed., 1861; and
<i>Jomini&rsquo;s Handbook of Military Etiquette</i>, West Point
ed., 1905.</p>
<p>It would not be honest in me to encourage by silence the
inference that I composed the Horse&rsquo;s private bugle-call,
for I did not.&nbsp; I lifted it, as Aristotle says.&nbsp; It is
the opening strain in <i>The Pizzicato</i> in <i>Sylvia</i>, by
Delibes.&nbsp; When that master was composing it he did not know
it was a bugle-call, it was I that found it out.</p>
<p>Along through the book I have distributed a few anachronisms
and unborn historical incidents and such things, so as to help
the tale over the difficult places.&nbsp; This idea is not
original with me; I got it out of Herodotus.&nbsp; Herodotus
says, &ldquo;Very few things happen at the right time, and the
rest do not happen at all: the conscientious historian will
correct these defects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cats in the chair do not belong to me, but to another.</p>
<p>These are all the exceptions.&nbsp; What is left of the book
is mine.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">SOLDIER BOY&mdash;PRIVATELY TO
HIMSELF</span></h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> Buffalo Bill&rsquo;s
horse.&nbsp; I have spent my life under his saddle&mdash;with him
in it, too, and he is good for two hundred pounds, without his
clothes; and there is no telling how much he does weigh when he
is out on the war-path and has his batteries belted on.&nbsp; He
is over six feet, is young, hasn&rsquo;t an ounce of waste flesh,
is straight, graceful, springy in his motions, quick as a cat,
and has a handsome face, and black hair dangling down on his
shoulders, and is beautiful to look at; and nobody is braver than
he is, and nobody is stronger, except myself.&nbsp; Yes, a person
that doubts that he is fine to see should see him in his beaded
buck-skins, on my back and his rifle peeping above his shoulder,
chasing a hostile trail, with me going like the wind and his hair
streaming out behind from the shelter of his broad slouch.&nbsp;
Yes, he is a sight to look at then&mdash;and I&rsquo;m part of it
myself.</p>
<p>I am his favorite horse, out of dozens.&nbsp; Big as he is, I
have carried him eighty-one miles between nightfall and sunrise
on the scout; and I am good for fifty, day in and day out, and
all the time.&nbsp; I am not large, but I am built on a business
basis.&nbsp; I have carried him thousands and thousands of miles
on scout duty for the army, and there&rsquo;s not a gorge, nor a
pass, nor a valley, nor a fort, nor a trading post, nor a
buffalo-range in the whole sweep of the Rocky Mountains and the
Great Plains that we don&rsquo;t know as well as we know the
bugle-calls.&nbsp; He is Chief of Scouts to the Army of the
Frontier, and it makes us very important.&nbsp; In such a
position as I hold in the military service one needs to be of
good family and possess an education much above the common to be
worthy of the place.&nbsp; I am the best-educated horse outside
of the hippodrome, everybody says, and the best-mannered.&nbsp;
It may be so, it is not for me to say; modesty is the best
policy, I think.&nbsp; Buffalo Bill taught me the most of what I
know, my mother taught me much, and I taught myself the
rest.&nbsp; Lay a row of moccasins before me&mdash;Pawnee, Sioux,
Shoshone, Cheyenne, Blackfoot, and as many other tribes as you
please&mdash;and I can name the tribe every moccasin belongs to
by the make of it.&nbsp; Name it in horse-talk, and could do it
in American if I had speech.</p>
<p>I know some of the Indian signs&mdash;the signs they make with
their hands, and by signal-fires at night and columns of smoke by
day.&nbsp; Buffalo Bill taught me how to drag wounded soldiers
out of the line of fire with my teeth; and I&rsquo;ve done it,
too; at least I&rsquo;ve dragged <i>him</i> out of the battle
when he was wounded.&nbsp; And not just once, but twice.&nbsp;
Yes, I know a lot of things.&nbsp; I remember forms, and gaits,
and faces; and you can&rsquo;t disguise a person that&rsquo;s
done me a kindness so that I won&rsquo;t know him thereafter
wherever I find him.&nbsp; I know the art of searching for a
trail, and I know the stale track from the fresh.&nbsp; I can
keep a trail all by myself, with Buffalo Bill asleep in the
saddle; ask him&mdash;he will tell you so.&nbsp; Many a time,
when he has ridden all night, he has said to me at dawn,
&ldquo;Take the watch, Boy; if the trail freshens, call
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he goes to sleep.&nbsp; He knows he can
trust me, because I have a reputation.&nbsp; A scout horse that
has a reputation does not play with it.</p>
<p>My mother was all American&mdash;no alkali-spider about
<i>her</i>, I can tell you; she was of the best blood of
Kentucky, the bluest Blue-grass aristocracy, very proud and
acrimonious&mdash;or maybe it is ceremonious.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
know which it is.&nbsp; But it is no matter; size is the main
thing about a word, and that one&rsquo;s up to standard.&nbsp;
She spent her military life as colonel of the Tenth Dragoons, and
saw a deal of rough service&mdash;distinguished service it was,
too.&nbsp; I mean, she <i>carried</i> the Colonel; but it&rsquo;s
all the same.&nbsp; Where would he be without his horse?&nbsp; He
wouldn&rsquo;t arrive.&nbsp; It takes two to make a colonel of
dragoons.&nbsp; She was a fine dragoon horse, but never got above
that.&nbsp; She was strong enough for the scout service, and had
the endurance, too, but she couldn&rsquo;t quite come up to the
speed required; a scout horse has to have steel in his muscle and
lightning in his blood.</p>
<p>My father was a bronco.&nbsp; Nothing as to lineage&mdash;that
is, nothing as to recent lineage&mdash;but plenty good enough
when you go a good way back.&nbsp; When Professor Marsh was out
here hunting bones for the chapel of Yale University he found
skeletons of horses no bigger than a fox, bedded in the rocks,
and he said they were ancestors of my father.&nbsp; My mother
heard him say it; and he said those skeletons were two million
years old, which astonished her and made her Kentucky pretensions
look small and pretty antiphonal, not to say oblique.&nbsp; Let
me see. . . . I used to know the meaning of those words, but . .
. well, it was years ago, and &rsquo;tisn&rsquo;t as vivid now as
it was when they were fresh.&nbsp; That sort of words
doesn&rsquo;t keep, in the kind of climate we have out
here.&nbsp; Professor Marsh said those skeletons were
fossils.&nbsp; So that makes me part blue grass and part fossil;
if there is any older or better stock, you will have to look for
it among the Four Hundred, I reckon.&nbsp; I am satisfied with
it.&nbsp; And am a happy horse, too, though born out of
wedlock.</p>
<p>And now we are back at Fort Paxton once more, after a
forty-day scout, away up as far as the Big Horn.&nbsp; Everything
quiet.&nbsp; Crows and Blackfeet squabbling&mdash;as
usual&mdash;but no outbreaks, and settlers feeling fairly
easy.</p>
<p>The Seventh Cavalry still in garrison, here; also the Ninth
Dragoons, two artillery companies, and some infantry.&nbsp; All
glad to see me, including General Alison, commandant.&nbsp; The
officers&rsquo; ladies and children well, and called upon
me&mdash;with sugar.&nbsp; Colonel Drake, Seventh Cavalry, said
some pleasant things; Mrs. Drake was very complimentary; also
Captain and Mrs. Marsh, Company B, Seventh Cavalry; also the
Chaplain, who is always kind and pleasant to me, because I kicked
the lungs out of a trader once.&nbsp; It was Tommy Drake and
Fanny Marsh that furnished the sugar&mdash;nice children, the
nicest at the post, I think.</p>
<p>That poor orphan child is on her way from
France&mdash;everybody is full of the subject.&nbsp; Her father
was General Alison&rsquo;s brother; married a beautiful young
Spanish lady ten years ago, and has never been in America
since.&nbsp; They lived in Spain a year or two, then went to
France.&nbsp; Both died some months ago.&nbsp; This little girl
that is coming is the only child.&nbsp; General Alison is glad to
have her.&nbsp; He has never seen her.&nbsp; He is a very nice
old bachelor, but is an old bachelor just the same and
isn&rsquo;t more than about a year this side of retirement by age
limit; and so what does he know about taking care of a little
maid nine years old?&nbsp; If I could have her it would be
another matter, for I know all about children, and they adore
me.&nbsp; Buffalo Bill will tell you so himself.</p>
<p>I have some of this news from over-hearing the
garrison-gossip, the rest of it I got from Potter, the
General&rsquo;s dog.&nbsp; Potter is the great Dane.&nbsp; He is
privileged, all over the post, like Shekels, the Seventh
Cavalry&rsquo;s dog, and visits everybody&rsquo;s quarters and
picks up everything that is going, in the way of news.&nbsp;
Potter has no imagination, and no great deal of culture, perhaps,
but he has a historical mind and a good memory, and so he is the
person I depend upon mainly to post me up when I get back from a
scout.&nbsp; That is, if Shekels is out on depredation and I
can&rsquo;t get hold of him.</p>
<h3><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>II<br
/>
<span class="GutSmall">LETTER FROM ROUEN&mdash;TO GENERAL
ALISON</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap"><i>My</i></span><i> dear
Brother-in-Law</i>,&mdash;Please let me write again in Spanish, I
cannot trust my English, and I am aware, from what your brother
used to say, that army officers educated at the Military Academy
of the United States are taught our tongue.&nbsp; It is as I told
you in my other letter: both my poor sister and her husband, when
they found they could not recover, expressed the wish that you
should have their little Catherine&mdash;as knowing that you
would presently be retired from the army&mdash;rather than that
she should remain with me, who am broken in health, or go to your
mother in California, whose health is also frail.</p>
<p>You do not know the child, therefore I must tell you something
about her.&nbsp; You will not be ashamed of her looks, for she is
a copy in little of her beautiful mother&mdash;and it is that
Andalusian beauty which is not surpassable, even in your
country.&nbsp; She has her mother&rsquo;s charm and grace and
good heart and sense of justice, and she has her father&rsquo;s
vivacity and cheerfulness and pluck and spirit of enterprise,
with the affectionate disposition and sincerity of both
parents.</p>
<p>My sister pined for her Spanish home all these years of exile;
she was always talking of Spain to the child, and tending and
nourishing the love of Spain in the little thing&rsquo;s heart as
a precious flower; and she died happy in the knowledge that the
fruitage of her patriotic labors was as rich as even she could
desire.</p>
<p>Cathy is a sufficiently good little scholar, for her nine
years; her mother taught her Spanish herself, and kept it always
fresh upon her ear and her tongue by hardly ever speaking with
her in any other tongue; her father was her English teacher, and
talked with her in that language almost exclusively; French has
been her everyday speech for more than seven years among her
playmates here; she has a good working use of
governess&mdash;German and Italian.&nbsp; It is true that there
is always a faint foreign fragrance about her speech, no matter
what language she is talking, but it is only just noticeable,
nothing more, and is rather a charm than a mar, I think.&nbsp; In
the ordinary child-studies Cathy is neither before nor behind the
average child of nine, I should say.&nbsp; But I can say this for
her: in love for her friends and in high-mindedness and
good-heartedness she has not many equals, and in my opinion no
superiors.&nbsp; And I beg of you, let her have her way with the
dumb animals&mdash;they are her worship.&nbsp; It is an
inheritance from her mother.&nbsp; She knows but little of
cruelties and oppressions&mdash;keep them from her sight if you
can.&nbsp; She would flare up at them and make trouble, in her
small but quite decided and resolute way; for she has a character
of her own, and lacks neither promptness nor initiative.&nbsp;
Sometimes her judgment is at fault, but I think her intentions
are always right.&nbsp; Once when she was a little creature of
three or four years she suddenly brought her tiny foot down upon
the floor in an apparent outbreak of indignation, then fetched it
a backward wipe, and stooped down to examine the result.&nbsp;
Her mother said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is it, child?&nbsp; What has stirred you
so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma, the big ant was trying to kill the little
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you protected the little one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, manure, because he had no friend, and I
wouldn&rsquo;t let the big one kill him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have killed them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cathy was distressed, and her lip trembled.&nbsp; She picked
up the remains and laid them upon her palm, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little anty, I&rsquo;m so sorry; and I
didn&rsquo;t mean to kill you, but there wasn&rsquo;t any other
way to save you, it was such a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is a dear and sweet little lady, and when she goes it will
give me a sore heart.&nbsp; But she will be happy with you, and
if your heart is old and tired, give it into her keeping; she
will make it young again, she will refresh it, she will make it
sing.&nbsp; Be good to her, for all our sakes!</p>
<p>My exile will soon be over now.&nbsp; As soon as I am a little
stronger I shall see my Spain again; and that will make me young
again!</p>

<span class="GutSmall">GENERAL ALISON TO HIS MOTHER</span></h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">am</span> glad to know that you are all
well, in San Bernardino.</p>
<p>. . . That grandchild of yours has been here&mdash;well, I do
not quite know how many days it is; nobody can keep account of
days or anything else where she is!&nbsp; Mother, she did what
the Indians were never able to do.&nbsp; She took the
Fort&mdash;took it the first day!&nbsp; Took me, too; took the
colonels, the captains, the women, the children, and the dumb
brutes; took Buffalo Bill, and all his scouts; took the
garrison&mdash;to the last man; and in forty-eight hours the
Indian encampment was hers, illustrious old Thunder-Bird and
all.&nbsp; Do I seem to have lost my solemnity, my gravity, my
poise, my dignity?&nbsp; You would lose your own, in my
circumstances.&nbsp; Mother, you never saw such a winning little
devil.&nbsp; She is all energy, and spirit, and sunshine, and
interest in everybody and everything, and pours out her prodigal
love upon every creature that will take it, high or low,
Christian or pagan, feathered or furred; and none has declined it
to date, and none ever will, I think.&nbsp; But she has a temper,
and sometimes it catches fire and flames up, and is likely to
burn whatever is near it; but it is soon over, the passion goes
as quickly as it comes.&nbsp; Of course she has an Indian name
already; Indians always rechristen a stranger early.&nbsp;
Thunder-Bird attended to her case.&nbsp; He gave her the Indian
equivalent for firebug, or fire-fly.&nbsp; He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Times, ver&rsquo; quiet, ver&rsquo; soft, like
summer night, but when she mad she blaze.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it good?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you see the
flare?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s beautiful, mother, beautiful as a
picture; and there is a touch of you in her face, and of her
father&mdash;poor George! and in her unresting activities, and
her fearless ways, and her sunbursts and cloudbursts, she is
always bringing George back to me.&nbsp; These impulsive natures
are dramatic.&nbsp; George was dramatic, so is this
Lightning-Bug, so is Buffalo Bill.&nbsp; When Cathy first
arrived&mdash;it was in the forenoon&mdash;Buffalo Bill was away,
carrying orders to Major Fuller, at Five Forks, up in the Clayton
Hills.&nbsp; At mid-afternoon I was at my desk, trying to work,
and this sprite had been making it impossible for half an
hour.&nbsp; At last I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you bewitching little scamp, <i>can&rsquo;t</i> you
be quiet just a minute or two, and let your poor old uncle attend
to a part of his duties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, uncle; I will, indeed,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, that&rsquo;s a good child&mdash;kiss
me.&nbsp; Now, then, sit up in that chair, and set your eye on
that clock.&nbsp; There&mdash;that&rsquo;s right.&nbsp; If you
stir&mdash;if you so much as wink&mdash;for four whole minutes,
I&rsquo;ll bite you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was very sweet and humble and obedient she looked, sitting
there, still as a mouse; I could hardly keep from setting her
free and telling her to make as much racket as she wanted
to.&nbsp; During as much as two minutes there was a most
unnatural and heavenly quiet and repose, then Buffalo Bill came
thundering up to the door in all his scout finery, flung himself
out of the saddle, said to his horse, &ldquo;Wait for me,
Boy,&rdquo; and stepped in, and stopped dead in his
tracks&mdash;gazing at the child.&nbsp; She forgot orders, and
was on the floor in a moment, saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are so beautiful!&nbsp; Do you like
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t, I love you!&rdquo; and he gathered
her up with a hug, and then set her on his
shoulder&mdash;apparently nine feet from the floor.</p>
<p>She was at home.&nbsp; She played with his long hair, and
admired his big hands and his clothes and his carbine, and asked
question after question, as fast as he could answer, until I
excused them both for half an hour, in order to have a chance to
finish my work.&nbsp; Then I heard Cathy exclaiming over Soldier
Boy; and he was worthy of her raptures, for he is a wonder of a
horse, and has a reputation which is as shining as his own silken
hide.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">CATHY TO HER AUNT MERCEDES</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Oh</span>, it is wonderful here, aunty
dear, just paradise!&nbsp; Oh, if you could only see it!
everything so wild and lovely; such grand plains, stretching such
miles and miles and miles, all the most delicious velvety sand
and sage-brush, and rabbits as big as a dog, and such tall and
noble jackassful ears that that is what they name them by; and
such vast mountains, and so rugged and craggy and lofty, with
cloud-shawls wrapped around their shoulders, and looking so
solemn and awful and satisfied; and the charming Indians, oh, how
you would dote on them, aunty dear, and they would on you, too,
and they would let you hold their babies, the way they do me, and
they <i>are</i> the fattest, and brownest, and sweetest little
things, and never cry, and wouldn&rsquo;t if they had pins
sticking in them, which they haven&rsquo;t, because they are poor
and can&rsquo;t afford it; and the horses and mules and cattle
and dogs&mdash;hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, and not an
animal that you can&rsquo;t do what you please with, except uncle
Thomas, but <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t mind him, he&rsquo;s lovely; and
oh, if you could hear the bugles:
<i>too&mdash;too&mdash;too-too&mdash;too&mdash;too</i>, and so
on&mdash;perfectly beautiful!&nbsp; Do you recognize that
one?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the first toots of the <i>reveille</i>; it
goes, dear me, <i>so</i> early in the morning!&mdash;then I and
every other soldier on the whole place are up and out in a
minute, except uncle Thomas, who is most unaccountably lazy, I
don&rsquo;t know why, but I have talked to him about it, and I
reckon it will be better, now.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t any faults
much, and is charming and sweet, like Buffalo Bill, and
Thunder-Bird, and Mammy Dorcas, and Soldier Boy, and Shekels, and
Potter, and Sour-Mash, and&mdash;well, they&rsquo;re <i>all</i>
that, just angels, as you may say.</p>
<p>The very first day I came, I don&rsquo;t know how long ago it
was, Buffalo Bill took me on Soldier Boy to Thunder-Bird&rsquo;s
camp, not the big one which is out on the plain, which is White
Cloud&rsquo;s, he took me to <i>that</i> one next day, but this
one is four or five miles up in the hills and crags, where there
is a great shut-in meadow, full of Indian lodges and dogs and
squaws and everything that is interesting, and a brook of the
clearest water running through it, with white pebbles on the
bottom and trees all along the banks cool and shady and good to
wade in, and as the sun goes down it is dimmish in there, but
away up against the sky you see the big peaks towering up and
shining bright and vivid in the sun, and sometimes an eagle
sailing by them, not flapping a wing, the same as if he was
asleep; and young Indians and girls romping and laughing and
carrying on, around the spring and the pool, and not much clothes
on except the girls, and dogs fighting, and the squaws busy at
work, and the bucks busy resting, and the old men sitting in a
bunch smoking, and passing the pipe not to the left but to the
right, which means there&rsquo;s been a row in the camp and they
are settling it if they can, and children playing <i>just</i> the
same as any other children, and little boys shooting at a mark
with bows, and I cuffed one of them because he hit a dog with a
club that wasn&rsquo;t doing anything, and he resented it but
before long he wished he hadn&rsquo;t: but this sentence is
getting too long and I will start another.&nbsp; Thunder-Bird put
on his Sunday-best war outfit to let me see him, and he was
splendid to look at, with his face painted red and bright and
intense like a fire-coal and a valance of eagle feathers from the
top of his head all down his back, and he had his tomahawk, too,
and his pipe, which has a stem which is longer than my arm, and I
never had such a good time in an Indian camp in my life, and I
learned a lot of words of the language, and next day BB took me
to the camp out on the Plains, four miles, and I had another good
time and got acquainted with some more Indians and dogs; and the
big chief, by the name of White Cloud, gave me a pretty little
bow and arrows and I gave him my red sash-ribbon, and in four
days I could shoot very well with it and beat any white boy of my
size at the post; and I have been to those camps plenty of times
since; and I have learned to ride, too, BB taught me, and every
day he practises me and praises me, and every time I do better
than ever he lets me have a scamper on Soldier Boy, and
<i>that&rsquo;s</i> the last agony of pleasure! for he is the
charmingest horse, and so beautiful and shiny and black, and
hasn&rsquo;t another color on him anywhere, except a white star
in his forehead, not just an imitation star, but a real one, with
four points, shaped exactly like a star that&rsquo;s hand-made,
and if you should cover him all up but his star you would know
him anywhere, even in Jerusalem or Australia, by that.&nbsp; And
I got acquainted with a good many of the Seventh Cavalry, and the
dragoons, and officers, and families, and horses, in the first
few days, and some more in the next few and the next few and the
next few, and now I know more soldiers and horses than you can
think, no matter how hard you try.&nbsp; I am keeping up my
studies every now and then, but there isn&rsquo;t much time for
it.&nbsp; I love you so! and I send you a hug and a kiss.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span

<span class="GutSmall">GENERAL ALISON TO MERCEDES</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">She</span> has been with us a good nice
long time, now.&nbsp; You are troubled about your sprite because
this is such a wild frontier, hundreds of miles from
civilization, and peopled only by wandering tribes of
savages?&nbsp; You fear for her safety?&nbsp; Give yourself no
uneasiness about her.&nbsp; Dear me, she&rsquo;s in a nursery!
and she&rsquo;s got more than eighteen hundred nurses.&nbsp; It
would distress the garrison to suspect that you think they
can&rsquo;t take care of her.&nbsp; They think they can.&nbsp;
They would tell you so themselves.&nbsp; You see, the Seventh
Cavalry has never had a child of its very own before, and neither
has the Ninth Dragoons; and so they are like all new mothers,
they think there is no other child like theirs, no other child so
wonderful, none that is so worthy to be faithfully and tenderly
looked after and protected.&nbsp; These bronzed veterans of mine
are very good mothers, I think, and wiser than some other
mothers; for they let her take lots of risks, and it is a good
education for her; and the more risks she takes and comes
successfully out of, the prouder they are of her.&nbsp; They
adopted her, with grave and formal military ceremonies of their
own invention&mdash;solemnities is the truer word; solemnities
that were so profoundly solemn and earnest, that the spectacle
would have been comical if it hadn&rsquo;t been so
touching.&nbsp; It was a good show, and as stately and complex as
guard-mount and the trooping of the colors; and it had its own
special music, composed for the occasion by the bandmaster of the
Seventh; and the child was as serious as the most serious
war-worn soldier of them all; and finally when they throned her
upon the shoulder of the oldest veteran, and pronounced her
&ldquo;well and truly adopted,&rdquo; and the bands struck up and
all saluted and she saluted in return, it was better and more
moving than any kindred thing I have seen on the stage, because
stage things are make-believe, but this was real and the
players&rsquo; hearts were in it.</p>
<p>It happened several weeks ago, and was followed by some
additional solemnities.&nbsp; The men created a couple of new
ranks, thitherto unknown to the army regulations, and conferred
them upon Cathy, with ceremonies suitable to a duke.&nbsp; So now
she is Corporal-General of the Seventh Cavalry, and
Flag-Lieutenant of the Ninth Dragoons, with the privilege
(decreed by the men) of writing U.S.A. after her name!&nbsp;
Also, they presented her a pair of shoulder-straps&mdash;both
dark blue, the one with F. L. on it, the other with C. G.&nbsp;
Also, a sword.&nbsp; She wears them.&nbsp; Finally, they granted
her the <i>salute</i>.&nbsp; I am witness that that ceremony is
faithfully observed by both parties&mdash;and most gravely and
decorously, too.&nbsp; I have never seen a soldier smile yet,
while delivering it, nor Cathy in returning it.</p>
<p>Ostensibly I was not present at these proceedings, and am
ignorant of them; but I was where I could see.&nbsp; I was afraid
of one thing&mdash;the jealousy of the other children of the
post; but there is nothing of that, I am glad to say.&nbsp; On
the contrary, they are proud of their comrade and her
honors.&nbsp; It is a surprising thing, but it is true.&nbsp; The
children are devoted to Cathy, for she has turned their dull
frontier life into a sort of continuous festival; also they know
her for a stanch and steady friend, a friend who can always be
depended upon, and does not change with the weather.</p>
<p>She has become a rather extraordinary rider, under the
tutorship of a more than extraordinary teacher&mdash;BB, which is
her pet name for Buffalo Bill.&nbsp; She pronounces it
<i>beeby</i>.&nbsp; He has not only taught her seventeen ways of
breaking her neck, but twenty-two ways of avoiding it.&nbsp; He
has infused into her the best and surest protection of a
horseman&mdash;<i>confidence</i>.&nbsp; He did it gradually,
systematically, little by little, a step at a time, and each step
made sure before the next was essayed.&nbsp; And so he inched her
along up through terrors that had been discounted by training
before she reached them, and therefore were not recognizable as
terrors when she got to them.&nbsp; Well, she is a daring little
rider, now, and is perfect in what she knows of
horsemanship.&nbsp; By-and-by she will know the art like a West
Point cadet, and will exercise it as fearlessly.&nbsp; She
doesn&rsquo;t know anything about side-saddles.&nbsp; Does that
distress you?&nbsp; And she is a fine performer, without any
saddle at all.&nbsp; Does that discomfort you?&nbsp; Do not let
it; she is not in any danger, I give you my word.</p>
<p>You said that if my heart was old and tired she would refresh
it, and you said truly.&nbsp; I do not know how I got along
without her, before.&nbsp; I was a forlorn old tree, but now that
this blossoming vine has wound itself about me and become the
life of my life, it is very different.&nbsp; As a furnisher of
business for me and for Mammy Dorcas she is exhaustlessly
competent, but I like my share of it and of course Dorcas likes
hers, for Dorcas &ldquo;raised&rdquo; George, and Cathy is George
over again in so many ways that she brings back Dorcas&rsquo;s
youth and the joys of that long-vanished time.&nbsp; My father
tried to set Dorcas free twenty years ago, when we still lived in
Virginia, but without success; she considered herself a member of
the family, and wouldn&rsquo;t go.&nbsp; And so, a member of the
family she remained, and has held that position unchallenged ever
since, and holds it now; for when my mother sent her here from
San Bernardino when we learned that Cathy was coming, she only
changed from one division of the family to the other.&nbsp; She
has the warm heart of her race, and its lavish affections, and
when Cathy arrived the pair were mother and child in five
minutes, and that is what they are to date and will
continue.&nbsp; Dorcas really thinks she raised George, and that
is one of her prides, but perhaps it was a mutual raising, for
their ages were the same&mdash;thirteen years short of
mine.&nbsp; But they were playmates, at any rate; as regards
that, there is no room for dispute.</p>
<p>Cathy thinks Dorcas is the best Catholic in America except
herself.&nbsp; She could not pay any one a higher compliment than
that, and Dorcas could not receive one that would please her
better.&nbsp; Dorcas is satisfied that there has never been a
more wonderful child than Cathy.&nbsp; She has conceived the
curious idea that Cathy is <i>twins</i>, and that one of them is
a boy-twin and failed to get segregated&mdash;got submerged, is
the idea.&nbsp; To argue with her that this is nonsense is a
waste of breath&mdash;her mind is made up, and arguments do not
affect it.&nbsp; She says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at her; she loves dolls, and girl-plays, and
everything a girl loves, and she&rsquo;s gentle and sweet, and
ain&rsquo;t cruel to dumb brutes&mdash;now that&rsquo;s the
girl-twin, but she loves boy-plays, and drums and fifes and
soldiering, and rough-riding, and ain&rsquo;t afraid of anybody
or anything&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the boy-twin; &rsquo;deed you
needn&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i> she&rsquo;s only <i>one</i> child;
no, sir, she&rsquo;s twins, and one of them got shet up out of
sight.&nbsp; Out of sight, but that don&rsquo;t make any
difference, that boy is in there, and you can see him look out of
her eyes when her temper is up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dorcas went on, in her simple and earnest way, to furnish
illustrations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that raven, Marse Tom.&nbsp; Would anybody
befriend a raven but that child?&nbsp; Of course they
wouldn&rsquo;t; it ain&rsquo;t natural.&nbsp; Well, the Injun boy
had the raven tied up, and was all the time plaguing it and
starving it, and she pitied the po&rsquo; thing, and tried to buy
it from the boy, and the tears was in her eyes.&nbsp; That was
the girl-twin, you see.&nbsp; She offered him her thimble, and he
flung it down; she offered him all the doughnuts she had, which
was two, and he flung them down; she offered him half a paper of
pins, worth forty ravens, and he made a mouth at her and jabbed
one of them in the raven&rsquo;s back.&nbsp; That was the limit,
you know.&nbsp; It called for the other twin.&nbsp; Her eyes
blazed up, and she jumped for him like a wild-cat, and when she
was done with him she was rags and he wasn&rsquo;t anything but
an allegory.&nbsp; That was most undoubtedly the other twin, you
see, coming to the front.&nbsp; No, sir; don&rsquo;t tell
<i>me</i> he ain&rsquo;t in there.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen him with
my own eyes&mdash;and plenty of times, at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allegory?&nbsp; What is an allegory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Marse Tom, it&rsquo;s one of her
words; she loves the big ones, you know, and I pick them up from
her; they sound good and I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened after she had converted the boy into an
allegory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, she untied the raven and confiscated him by force
and fetched him home, and left the doughnuts and things on the
ground.&nbsp; Petted him, of course, like she does with every
creature.&nbsp; In two days she had him so stuck after her that
she&mdash;well, <i>you</i> know how he follows her everywhere,
and sets on her shoulder often when she rides her breakneck
rampages&mdash;all of which is the girl-twin to the front, you
see&mdash;and he does what he pleases, and is up to all kinds of
devilment, and is a perfect nuisance in the kitchen.&nbsp; Well,
they all stand it, but they wouldn&rsquo;t if it was another
person&rsquo;s bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here she began to chuckle comfortably, and presently she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, she&rsquo;s a nuisance herself, Miss
Cathy is, she <i>is</i> so busy, and into everything, like that
bird.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all just as innocent, you know, and she
don&rsquo;t mean any harm, and is so good and dear; and it
ain&rsquo;t her fault, it&rsquo;s her nature; her interest is
always a-working and always red-hot, and she can&rsquo;t keep
quiet.&nbsp; Well, yesterday it was &lsquo;Please, Miss Cathy,
don&rsquo;t do that&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;Please, Miss Cathy, let
that alone&rsquo;; and, &lsquo;Please, Miss Cathy, don&rsquo;t
make so much noise&rsquo;; and so on and so on, till I reckon I
had found fault fourteen times in fifteen minutes; then she
looked up at me with her big brown eyes that can plead so, and
said in that odd little foreign way that goes to your heart,</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Please, mammy, make me a compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course you did it, you old fool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marse Tom, I just grabbed her up to my breast and says,
&lsquo;Oh, you po&rsquo; dear little motherless thing, you
ain&rsquo;t got a fault in the world, and you can do anything you
want to, and tear the house down, and yo&rsquo; old black mammy
won&rsquo;t say a word!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course, of course&mdash;<i>I</i> knew
you&rsquo;d spoil the child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She brushed away her tears, and said with dignity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoil the child? spoil <i>that</i> child, Marse
Tom?&nbsp; There can&rsquo;t <i>anybody</i> spoil her.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s the king bee of this post, and everybody pets her and
is her slave, and yet, as you know, your own self, she
ain&rsquo;t the least little bit spoiled.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she
eased her mind with this retort: &ldquo;Marse Tom, she makes you
do anything she wants to, and you can&rsquo;t deny it; so if she
could be spoilt, she&rsquo;d been spoilt long ago, because you
are the very <i>worst</i>!&nbsp; Look at that pile of cats in
your chair, and you sitting on a candle-box, just as patient;
it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re her cats.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>If Dorcas were a soldier, I could punish her for such large
frankness as that.&nbsp; I changed the subject, and made her
resume her illustrations.&nbsp; She had scored against me fairly,
and I wasn&rsquo;t going to cheapen her victory by disputing
it.&nbsp; She proceeded to offer this incident in evidence on her
twin theory:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two weeks ago when she got her finger mashed open, she
turned pretty pale with the pain, but she never said a
word.&nbsp; I took her in my lap, and the surgeon sponged off the
blood and took a needle and thread and began to sew it up; it had
to have a lot of stitches, and each one made her scrunch a
little, but she never let go a sound.&nbsp; At last the surgeon
was so full of admiration that he said, &lsquo;Well, you
<i>are</i> a brave little thing!&rsquo; and she said, just as
ca&rsquo;m and simple as if she was talking about the weather,
&lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t anybody braver but the Cid!&rsquo;&nbsp;
You see? it was the boy-twin that the surgeon was a-dealing
with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the Cid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, sir&mdash;at least only what she
says.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s always talking about him, and says he was
the bravest hero Spain ever had, or any other country.&nbsp; They
have it up and down, the children do, she standing up for the
Cid, and they working George Washington for all he is
worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they quarrel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s only disputing, and bragging, the way
children do.&nbsp; They want her to be an American, but she
can&rsquo;t be anything but a Spaniard, she says.&nbsp; You see,
her mother was always longing for home, po&rsquo; thing! and
thinking about it, and so the child is just as much a Spaniard as
if she&rsquo;d always lived there.&nbsp; She thinks she remembers
how Spain looked, but I reckon she don&rsquo;t, because she was
only a baby when they moved to France.&nbsp; She is very proud to
be a Spaniard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does that please you, Mercedes?&nbsp; Very well, be content;
your niece is loyal to her allegiance: her mother laid deep the
foundations of her love for Spain, and she will go back to you as
good a Spaniard as you are yourself.&nbsp; She has made me
promise to take her to you for a long visit when the War Office
retires me.</p>
<p>I attend to her studies myself; has she told you that?&nbsp;
Yes, I am her school-master, and she makes pretty good progress,
I think, everything considered.&nbsp; Everything
considered&mdash;being translated&mdash;means holidays.&nbsp; But
the fact is, she was not born for study, and it comes hard.&nbsp;
Hard for me, too; it hurts me like a physical pain to see that
free spirit of the air and the sunshine laboring and grieving
over a book; and sometimes when I find her gazing far away
towards the plain and the blue mountains with the longing in her
eyes, I have to throw open the prison doors; I can&rsquo;t help
it.&nbsp; A quaint little scholar she is, and makes plenty of
blunders.&nbsp; Once I put the question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the Czar govern?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rested her elbow on her knee and her chin on her hand and
took that problem under deep consideration.&nbsp; Presently she
looked up and answered, with a rising inflection implying a shade
of uncertainty,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dative case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here are a couple of her expositions which were delivered with
tranquil confidence:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Chaplain</i>, diminutive of chap.&nbsp; <i>Lass</i>
is masculine, <i>lassie</i> is feminine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She is not a genius, you see, but just a normal child; they
all make mistakes of that sort.&nbsp; There is a glad light in
her eye which is pretty to see when she finds herself able to
answer a question promptly and accurately, without any
hesitation; as, for instance, this morning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cathy dear, what is a cube?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a native of Cuba.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She still drops a foreign word into her talk now and then, and
there is still a subtle foreign flavor or fragrance about even
her exactest English&mdash;and long may this abide! for it has
for me a charm that is very pleasant.&nbsp; Sometimes her English
is daintily prim and bookish and captivating.&nbsp; She has a
child&rsquo;s sweet tooth, but for her health&rsquo;s sake I try
to keep its inspirations under cheek.&nbsp; She is
obedient&mdash;as is proper for a titled and recognized military
personage, which she is&mdash;but the chain presses
sometimes.&nbsp; For instance, we were out for a walk, and passed
by some bushes that were freighted with wild goose-berries.&nbsp;
Her face brightened and she put her hands together and delivered
herself of this speech, most feelingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if I was permitted a vice it would be the
<i>gourmandise</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Could I resist that?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I gave her a
gooseberry.</p>
<p>You ask about her languages.&nbsp; They take care of
themselves; they will not get rusty here; our regiments are not

PLUG</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">When</span> did you
come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrived at sundown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Salt Lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in the service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pirate trade, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you when you came.&nbsp; I recognized your
master.&nbsp; He is a bad sort.&nbsp; Trap-robber, horse-thief,
squaw-man, renegado&mdash;Hank Butters&mdash;I know him very
well.&nbsp; Stole you, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it amounted to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so.&nbsp; Where is his pard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stopped at White Cloud&rsquo;s camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is another of the same stripe, is Blake
Haskins.&rdquo;&nbsp; (<i>Aside</i>.)&nbsp; They are laying for
Buffalo Bill again, I guess.&nbsp; (<i>Aloud</i>.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you got more than one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I get a new one every time I&rsquo;m stolen.&nbsp; I
used to have an honest name, but that was early; I&rsquo;ve
forgotten it.&nbsp; Since then I&rsquo;ve had thirteen
<i>aliases</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aliases?&nbsp; What is alias?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A false name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alias.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a fine large word, and is in my
line; it has quite a learned and cerebrospinal incandescent
sound.&nbsp; Are you educated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I can&rsquo;t claim it.&nbsp; I can take down
bars, I can distinguish oats from shoe-pegs, I can blaspheme a
saddle-boil with the college-bred, and I know a few other
things&mdash;not many; I have had no chance, I have always had to
work; besides, I am of low birth and no family.&nbsp; You speak
my dialect like a native, but you are not a Mexican Plug, you are
a gentleman, I can see that; and educated, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am of old family, and not illiterate.&nbsp; I am
a fossil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fossil.&nbsp; The first horses were fossils.&nbsp; They
date back two million years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gr-eat sand and sage-brush! do you mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is true.&nbsp; The bones of my ancestors are
held in reverence and worship, even by men.&nbsp; They do not
leave them exposed to the weather when they find them, but carry
them three thousand miles and enshrine them in their temples of
learning, and worship them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful!&nbsp; I knew you must be a person of
distinction, by your fine presence and courtly address, and by
the fact that you are not subjected to the indignity of hobbles,
like myself and the rest.&nbsp; Would you tell me your
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have probably heard of it&mdash;Soldier
Boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&mdash;the renowned, the illustrious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes my breath!&nbsp; Little did I dream that ever
I should stand face to face with the possessor of that great
name.&nbsp; Buffalo Bill&rsquo;s horse!&nbsp; Known from the
Canadian border to the deserts of Arizona, and from the eastern
marches of the Great Plains to the foot-hills of the
Sierra!&nbsp; Truly this is a memorable day.&nbsp; You still
serve the celebrated Chief of Scouts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am still his property, but he has lent me, for a
time, to the most noble, the most gracious, the most excellent,
her Excellency Catherine, Corporal-General Seventh Cavalry and
Flag-Lieutenant Ninth Dragoons, U.S.A.,&mdash;on whom be
peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen.&nbsp; Did you say <i>her</i>
Excellency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same.&nbsp; A Spanish lady, sweet blossom of a
ducal house.&nbsp; And truly a wonder; knowing everything,
capable of everything; speaking all the languages, master of all
sciences, a mind without horizons, a heart of gold, the glory of
her race!&nbsp; On whom be peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen.&nbsp; It is marvellous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily.&nbsp; I knew many things, she has taught me
others.&nbsp; I am educated.&nbsp; I will tell you about
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I listen&mdash;I am enchanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell a plain tale, calmly, without excitement,
without eloquence.&nbsp; When she had been here four or five
weeks she was already erudite in military things, and they made
her an officer&mdash;a double officer.&nbsp; She rode the drill
every day, like any soldier; and she could take the bugle and
direct the evolutions herself.&nbsp; Then, on a day, there was a
grand race, for prizes&mdash;none to enter but the
children.&nbsp; Seventeen children entered, and she was the
youngest.&nbsp; Three girls, fourteen boys&mdash;good riders
all.&nbsp; It was a steeplechase, with four hurdles, all pretty
high.&nbsp; The first prize was a most cunning half-grown silver
bugle, and mighty pretty, with red silk cord and tassels.&nbsp;
Buffalo Bill was very anxious; for he had taught her to ride, and
he did most dearly want her to win that race, for the glory of
it.&nbsp; So he wanted her to ride me, but she wouldn&rsquo;t;
and she reproached him, and said it was unfair and unright, and
taking advantage; for what horse in this post or any other could
stand a chance against me? and she was very severe with him, and
said, &lsquo;You ought to be ashamed&mdash;you are proposing to
me conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman.&rsquo;&nbsp; So
he just tossed her up in the air about thirty feet and caught her
as she came down, and said he was ashamed; and put up his
handkerchief and pretended to cry, which nearly broke her heart,
and she petted him, and begged him to forgive her, and said she
would do anything in the world he could ask but that; but he said
he ought to go hang himself, and he <i>must</i>, if he could get
a rope; it was nothing but right he should, for he never, never
could forgive himself; and then <i>she</i> began to cry, and they
both sobbed, the way you could hear him a mile, and she clinging
around his neck and pleading, till at last he was comforted a
little, and gave his solemn promise he wouldn&rsquo;t hang
himself till after the race; and wouldn&rsquo;t do it at all if
she won it, which made her happy, and she said she would win it
or die in the saddle; so then everything was pleasant again and
both of them content.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t help playing jokes on
her, he is so fond of her and she is so innocent and
unsuspecting; and when she finds it out she cuffs him and is in a
fury, but presently forgives him because it&rsquo;s him; and
maybe the very next day she&rsquo;s caught with another joke; you
see she can&rsquo;t learn any better, because she hasn&rsquo;t
any deceit in her, and that kind aren&rsquo;t ever expecting it
in another person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a grand race.&nbsp; The whole post was there,
and there was such another whooping and shouting when the
seventeen kids came flying down the turf and sailing over the
hurdles&mdash;oh, beautiful to see!&nbsp; Half-way down, it was
kind of neck and neck, and anybody&rsquo;s race and
nobody&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Then, what should happen but a cow steps
out and puts her head down to munch grass, with her broadside to
the battalion, and they a-coming like the wind; they split apart
to flank her, but <i>she</i>?&mdash;why, she drove the spurs home
and soared over that cow like a bird! and on she went, and
cleared the last hurdle solitary and alone, the army letting
loose the grand yell, and she skipped from the horse the same as
if he had been standing still, and made her bow, and everybody
crowded around to congratulate, and they gave her the bugle, and
she put it to her lips and blew &lsquo;boots and saddles&rsquo;
to see how it would go, and BB was as proud as you can&rsquo;t
think!&nbsp; And he said, &lsquo;Take Soldier Boy, and
don&rsquo;t pass him back till I ask for him!&rsquo; and I can
tell you he wouldn&rsquo;t have said that to any other person on
this planet.&nbsp; That was two months and more ago, and nobody
has been on my back since but the Corporal-General Seventh
Cavalry and Flag-Lieutenant of the Ninth Dragoons,
U.S.A.,&mdash;on whom be peace!&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen.&nbsp; I listen&mdash;tell me more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She set to work and organized the Sixteen, and called
it the First Battalion Rocky Mountain Rangers, U.S.A., and she
wanted to be bugler, but they elected her Lieutenant-General and
Bugler.&nbsp; So she ranks her uncle the commandant, who is only
a Brigadier.&nbsp; And doesn&rsquo;t she train those little
people!&nbsp; Ask the Indians, ask the traders, ask the soldiers;
they&rsquo;ll tell you.&nbsp; She has been at it from the first
day.&nbsp; Every morning they go clattering down into the plain,
and there she sits on my back with her bugle at her mouth and
sounds the orders and puts them through the evolutions for an
hour or more; and it is too beautiful for anything to see those
ponies dissolve from one formation into another, and waltz about,
and break, and scatter, and form again, always moving, always
graceful, now trotting, now galloping, and so on, sometimes near
by, sometimes in the distance, all just like a state ball, you
know, and sometimes she can&rsquo;t hold herself any longer, but
sounds the &lsquo;charge,&rsquo; and turns me loose! and you can
take my word for it, if the battalion hasn&rsquo;t too much of a
start we catch up and go over the breastworks with the front
line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are soldiers, those little people; and
healthy, too, not ailing any more, the way they used to be
sometimes.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s because of her drill.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s got a fort, now&mdash;Fort Fanny Marsh.&nbsp;
Major-General Tommy Drake planned it out, and the Seventh and
Dragoons built it.&nbsp; Tommy is the Colonel&rsquo;s son, and is
fifteen and the oldest in the Battalion; Fanny Marsh is
Brigadier-General, and is next oldest&mdash;over thirteen.&nbsp;
She is daughter of Captain Marsh, Company B, Seventh
Cavalry.&nbsp; Lieutenant-General Alison is the youngest by
considerable; I think she is about nine and a half or
three-quarters.&nbsp; Her military rig, as Lieutenant-General,
isn&rsquo;t for business, it&rsquo;s for dress parade, because
the ladies made it.&nbsp; They say they got it out of the Middle
Ages&mdash;out of a book&mdash;and it is all red and blue and
white silks and satins and velvets; tights, trunks, sword,
doublet with slashed sleeves, short cape, cap with just one
feather in it; I&rsquo;ve heard them name these things; they got
them out of the book; she&rsquo;s dressed like a page, of old
times, they say.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the daintiest outfit that ever
was&mdash;you will say so, when you see it.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
lovely in it&mdash;oh, just a dream!&nbsp; In some ways she is
just her age, but in others she&rsquo;s as old as her uncle, I
think.&nbsp; She is very learned.&nbsp; She teaches her uncle his
book.&nbsp; I have seen her sitting by with the book and reciting
to him what is in it, so that he can learn to do it himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every Saturday she hires little Injuns to garrison her
fort; then she lays siege to it, and makes military approaches by
make-believe trenches in make-believe night, and finally at
make-believe dawn she draws her sword and sounds the assault and
takes it by storm.&nbsp; It is for practice.&nbsp; And she has
invented a bugle-call all by herself, out of her own head, and
it&rsquo;s a stirring one, and the prettiest in the
service.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s to call <i>me</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s
never used for anything else.&nbsp; She taught it to me, and told
me what it says: &lsquo;<i>It is I</i>,
<i>Soldier&mdash;come</i>!&rsquo; and when those thrilling notes
come floating down the distance I hear them without fail, even if
I am two miles away; and then&mdash;oh, then you should see my
heels get down to business!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she has taught me how to say good-morning and
good-night to her, which is by lifting my right hoof for her to
shake; and also how to say good-bye; I do that with my left
foot&mdash;but only for practice, because there hasn&rsquo;t been
any but make-believe good-byeing yet, and I hope there
won&rsquo;t ever be.&nbsp; It would make me cry if I ever had to
put up my left foot in earnest.&nbsp; She has taught me how to
salute, and I can do it as well as a soldier.&nbsp; I bow my head
low, and lay my right hoof against my cheek.&nbsp; She taught me
that because I got into disgrace once, through ignorance.&nbsp; I
am privileged, because I am known to be honorable and
trustworthy, and because I have a distinguished record in the
service; so they don&rsquo;t hobble me nor tie me to stakes or
shut me tight in stables, but let me wander around to suit
myself.&nbsp; Well, trooping the colors is a very solemn
ceremony, and everybody must stand uncovered when the flag goes
by, the commandant and all; and once I was there, and ignorantly
walked across right in front of the band, which was an awful
disgrace: Ah, the Lieutenant-General was so ashamed, and so
distressed that I should have done such a thing before all the
world, that she couldn&rsquo;t keep the tears back; and then she
taught me the salute, so that if I ever did any other unmilitary
act through ignorance I could do my salute and she believed
everybody would think it was apology enough and would not press
the matter.&nbsp; It is very nice and distinguished; no other
horse can do it; often the men salute me, and I return it.&nbsp;
I am privileged to be present when the Rocky Mountain Rangers
troop the colors and I stand solemn, like the children, and I
salute when the flag goes by.&nbsp; Of course when she goes to
her fort her sentries sing out &lsquo;Turn out the guard!&rsquo;
and then . . . do you catch that refreshing early-morning whiff
from the mountain-pines and the wild flowers?&nbsp; The night is
far spent; we&rsquo;ll hear the bugles before long.&nbsp; Dorcas,
the black woman, is very good and nice; she takes care of the
Lieutenant-General, and is Brigadier-General Alison&rsquo;s
mother, which makes her mother-in-law to the
Lieutenant-General.&nbsp; That is what Shekels says.&nbsp; At
least it is what I think he says, though I never can understand
him quite clearly. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Shekels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Seventh Cavalry dog.&nbsp; I mean, if he <i>is</i>
a dog.&nbsp; His father was a coyote and his mother was a
wild-cat.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t really make a dog out of him,
does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a real dog, I should think.&nbsp; Only a kind of a
general dog, at most, I reckon.&nbsp; Though this is a matter of
ichthyology, I suppose; and if it is, it is out of my depth, and
so my opinion is not valuable, and I don&rsquo;t claim much
consideration for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t ichthyology; it is dogmatics, which is
still more difficult and tangled up.&nbsp; Dogmatics always
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dogmatics is quite beyond me, quite; so I am not
competing.&nbsp; But on general principles it is my opinion that
a colt out of a coyote and a wild-cat is no square dog, but
doubtful.&nbsp; That is my hand, and I stand pat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is as far as I can go myself, and be fair and
conscientious.&nbsp; I have always regarded him as a doubtful
dog, and so has Potter.&nbsp; Potter is the great Dane.&nbsp;
Potter says he is no dog, and not even poultry&mdash;though I do
not go quite so far as that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wouldn&rsquo;t, myself.&nbsp; Poultry is one of
those things which no person can get to the bottom of, there is
so much of it and such variety.&nbsp; It is just wings, and
wings, and wings, till you are weary: turkeys, and geese, and
bats, and butterflies, and angels, and grasshoppers, and
flying-fish, and&mdash;well, there is really no end to the tribe;
it gives me the heaves just to think of it.&nbsp; But this one
hasn&rsquo;t any wings, has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, in my belief he is more likely to be dog
than poultry.&nbsp; I have not heard of poultry that hadn&rsquo;t
wings.&nbsp; Wings is the <i>sign</i> of poultry; it is what you
tell poultry by.&nbsp; Look at the mosquito.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you reckon he is, then?&nbsp; He must be
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he could be a reptile; anything that hasn&rsquo;t
wings is a reptile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody told me, but I overheard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you overhear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years ago.&nbsp; I was with the Philadelphia Institute
expedition in the Bad Lands under Professor Cope, hunting
mastodon bones, and I overheard him say, his own self, that any
plantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium that hadn&rsquo;t
wings and was uncertain was a reptile.&nbsp; Well, then, has this
dog any wings?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Is he a plantigrade circumflex
vertebrate bacterium?&nbsp; Maybe so, maybe not; but without ever
having seen him, and judging only by his illegal and spectacular
parentage, I will bet the odds of a bale of hay to a bran mash
that he looks it.&nbsp; Finally, is he uncertain?&nbsp; That is
the point&mdash;is he uncertain?&nbsp; I will leave it to you if
you have ever heard of a more uncertainer dog than what this one
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, he&rsquo;s a reptile.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, look here, whatsyourname&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last alias, Mongrel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good one, too.&nbsp; I was going to say, you are
better educated than you have been pretending to be.&nbsp; I like
cultured society, and I shall cultivate your acquaintance.&nbsp;
Now as to Shekels, whenever you want to know about any private
thing that is going on at this post or in White Cloud&rsquo;s
camp or Thunder-Bird&rsquo;s, he can tell you; and if you make
friends with him he&rsquo;ll be glad to, for he is a born gossip,
and picks up all the tittle-tattle.&nbsp; Being the whole Seventh
Cavalry&rsquo;s reptile, he doesn&rsquo;t belong to anybody in
particular, and hasn&rsquo;t any military duties; so he comes and
goes as he pleases, and is popular with all the house cats and
other authentic sources of private information.&nbsp; He
understands all the languages, and talks them all, too.&nbsp;
With an accent like gritting your teeth, it is true, and with a
grammar that is no improvement on blasphemy&mdash;still, with
practice you get at the meat of what he says, and it serves. . .
Hark!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the reveille. . . .</p>

<span class="GutSmall">SOLDIER BOY AND SHEKELS</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Did</span> you do as I told
you?&nbsp; Did you look up the Mexican Plug?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I made his acquaintance before night and got his
friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked him.&nbsp; Did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at first.&nbsp; He took me for a reptile, and it
troubled me, because I didn&rsquo;t know whether it was a
compliment or not.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t ask him, because it
would look ignorant.&nbsp; So I didn&rsquo;t say anything, and
soon liked him very well indeed.&nbsp; Was it a compliment, do
you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is what it was.&nbsp; They are very rare, the
reptiles; very few left, now-a-days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&nbsp; What is a reptile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a plantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium
that hasn&rsquo;t any wings and is uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&mdash;it sounds fine, it surely
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it <i>is</i> fine.&nbsp; You may be thankful you
are one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&nbsp; It seems wonderfully grand and elegant for
a person that is so humble as I am; but I am thankful, I am
indeed, and will try to live up to it.&nbsp; It is hard to
remember.&nbsp; Will you say it again, please, and say it
slow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plantigrade circumflex vertebrate bacterium that
hasn&rsquo;t any wings and is uncertain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful, anybody must grant it; beautiful, and
of a noble sound.&nbsp; I hope it will not make me proud and
stuck-up&mdash;I should not like to be that.&nbsp; It is much
more distinguished and honorable to be a reptile than a dog,
don&rsquo;t you think, Soldier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s no comparison.&nbsp; It is awfully
aristocratic.&nbsp; Often a duke is called a reptile; it is set
down so, in history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that grand!&nbsp; Potter wouldn&rsquo;t
ever associate with me, but I reckon he&rsquo;ll be glad to when
he finds out what I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will thank Mongrel for this. He is a very good sort,
for a Mexican Plug.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my opinion of him; and as for his birth, he
cannot help that.&nbsp; We cannot all be reptiles, we cannot all
be fossils; we have to take what comes and be thankful it is no
worse.&nbsp; It is the true philosophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For those others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick to the subject, please.&nbsp; Did it turn out
that my suspicions were right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, perfectly right.&nbsp; Mongrel has heard them
planning.&nbsp; They are after BB&rsquo;s life, for running them
out of Medicine Bow and taking their stolen horses away from
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;ll get him yet, for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if he keeps a sharp look-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> keep a sharp lookout!&nbsp; He never does; he
despises them, and all their kind.&nbsp; His life is always being
threatened, and so it has come to be monotonous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know they are here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he knows it.&nbsp; He is always the earliest to
know who comes and who goes.&nbsp; But he cares nothing for them
and their threats; he only laughs when people warn him.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ll shoot him from behind a tree the first he
knows.&nbsp; Did Mongrel tell you their plans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; They have found out that he starts for Fort
Clayton day after to-morrow, with one of his scouts; so they will
leave to-morrow, letting on to go south, but they will fetch
around north all in good time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Well</span>, this is the way it
happened.&nbsp; We did the escort duty; then we came back and
struck for the plain and put the Rangers through a rousing
drill&mdash;oh, for hours!&nbsp; Then we sent them home under
Brigadier-General Fanny Marsh; then the Lieutenant-General and I
went off on a gallop over the plains for about three hours, and
were lazying along home in the middle of the afternoon, when we
met Jimmy Slade, the drummer-boy, and he saluted and asked the
Lieutenant-General if she had heard the news, and she said no,
and he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Buffalo Bill has been ambushed and badly shot
this side of Clayton, and Thorndike the scout, too; Bill
couldn&rsquo;t travel, but Thorndike could, and he brought the
news, and Sergeant Wilkes and six men of Company B are gone, two
hours ago, hotfoot, to get Bill.&nbsp; And they
say&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Go</i>!&rsquo; she shouts to me&mdash;and I
went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask foolish questions.&nbsp; It was an
awful pace.&nbsp; For four hours nothing happened, and not a word
said, except that now and then she said, &lsquo;Keep it up, Boy,
keep it up, sweetheart; we&rsquo;ll save him!&rsquo;&nbsp; I kept
it up.&nbsp; Well, when the dark shut down, in the rugged hills,
that poor little chap had been tearing around in the saddle all
day, and I noticed by the slack knee-pressure that she was tired
and tottery, and I got dreadfully afraid; but every time I tried
to slow down and let her go to sleep, so I could stop, she
hurried me up again; and so, sure enough, at last over she
went!</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that was a fix to be in I for she lay there and
didn&rsquo;t stir, and what was I to do?&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
leave her to fetch help, on account of the wolves.&nbsp; There
was nothing to do but stand by.&nbsp; It was dreadful.&nbsp; I
was afraid she was killed, poor little thing!&nbsp; But she
wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; She came to, by-and-by, and said, &lsquo;Kiss
me, Soldier,&rsquo; and those were blessed words.&nbsp; I kissed
her&mdash;often; I am used to that, and we like it.&nbsp; But she
didn&rsquo;t get up, and I was worried.&nbsp; She fondled my nose
with her hand, and talked to me, and called me endearing
names&mdash;which is her way&mdash;but she caressed with the same
hand all the time.&nbsp; The other arm was broken, you see, but I
didn&rsquo;t know it, and she didn&rsquo;t mention it.&nbsp; She
didn&rsquo;t want to distress me, you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon the big gray wolves came, and hung around, and you
could hear them snarl, and snap at each other, but you
couldn&rsquo;t see anything of them except their eyes, which
shone in the dark like sparks and stars.&nbsp; The
Lieutenant-General said, &lsquo;If I had the Rocky Mountain
Rangers here, we would make those creatures climb a
tree.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she made believe that the Rangers were in
hearing, and put up her bugle and blew the
&lsquo;assembly&rsquo;; and then, &lsquo;boots and
saddles&rsquo;; then the &lsquo;trot&rsquo;;
&lsquo;gallop&rsquo;; &lsquo;charge!&rsquo;&nbsp; Then she blew
the &lsquo;retreat,&rsquo; and said, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s for you,
you rebels; the Rangers don&rsquo;t ever retreat!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The music frightened them away, but they were hungry,
and kept coming back.&nbsp; And of course they got bolder and
bolder, which is their way.&nbsp; It went on for an hour, then
the tired child went to sleep, and it was pitiful to hear her
moan and nestle, and I couldn&rsquo;t do anything for her.&nbsp;
All the time I was laying for the wolves.&nbsp; They are in my
line; I have had experience.&nbsp; At last the boldest one
ventured within my lines, and I landed him among his friends with
some of his skull still on him, and they did the rest.&nbsp; In
the next hour I got a couple more, and they went the way of the
first one, down the throats of the detachment.&nbsp; That
satisfied the survivors, and they went away and left us in
peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hadn&rsquo;t any more adventures, though I kept
awake all night and was ready.&nbsp; From midnight on the child
got very restless, and out of her head, and moaned, and said,
&lsquo;Water, water&mdash;thirsty&rsquo;; and now and then,
&lsquo;Kiss me, Soldier&rsquo;; and sometimes she was in her fort
and giving orders to her garrison; and once she was in Spain, and
thought her mother was with her.&nbsp; People say a horse
can&rsquo;t cry; but they don&rsquo;t know, because we cry
inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an hour after sunup that I heard the boys
coming, and recognized the hoof-beats of Pomp and C&aelig;sar and
Jerry, old mates of mine; and a welcomer sound there
couldn&rsquo;t ever be.</p>
<p>Buffalo Bill was in a horse-litter, with his leg broken by a
bullet, and Mongrel and Blake Haskins&rsquo;s horse were doing
the work.&nbsp; Buffalo Bill and Thorndike had lolled both of
those toughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they got to us, and Buffalo Bill saw the child
lying there so white, he said, &lsquo;My God!&rsquo; and the
sound of his voice brought her to herself, and she gave a little
cry of pleasure and struggled to get up, but couldn&rsquo;t, and
the soldiers gathered her up like the tenderest women, and their
eyes were wet and they were not ashamed, when they saw her arm
dangling; and so were Buffalo Bill&rsquo;s, and when they laid
her in his arms he said, &lsquo;My darling, how does this
come?&rsquo; and she said, &lsquo;We came to save you, but I was
tired, and couldn&rsquo;t keep awake, and fell off and hurt
myself, and couldn&rsquo;t get on again.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You
came to save me, you dear little rat?&nbsp; It was too lovely of
you!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, and Soldier stood by me, which you
know he would, and protected me from the wolves; and if he got a
chance he kicked the life out of some of them&mdash;for you know
he would, BB.&rsquo;&nbsp; The sergeant said, &lsquo;He laid out
three of them, sir, and here&rsquo;s the bones to show for
it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a grand horse,&rsquo; said BB;
&lsquo;he&rsquo;s the grandest horse that ever was! and has saved
your life, Lieutenant-General Alison, and shall protect it the
rest of his life&mdash;he&rsquo;s yours for a kiss!&rsquo;&nbsp;
He got it, along with a passion of delight, and he said,
&lsquo;You are feeling better now, little Spaniard&mdash;do you
think you could blow the advance?&rsquo;&nbsp; She put up the
bugle to do it, but he said wait a minute first.&nbsp; Then he
and the sergeant set her arm and put it in splints, she wincing
but not whimpering; then we took up the march for home, and
that&rsquo;s the end of the tale; and I&rsquo;m her horse.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t she a brick, Shekels?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brick?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s more than a brick, more than a
thousand bricks&mdash;she&rsquo;s a reptile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a compliment out of your heart,
Shekels.&nbsp; God bless you for it!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">GENERAL ALISON AND DORCAS</span></h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Too</span> much company for her,
Marse Tom.&nbsp; Betwixt you, and Shekels, the Colonel&rsquo;s
wife, and the Cid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cid?&nbsp; Oh, I remember&mdash;the
raven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and Mrs. Captain Marsh and Famine and Pestilence
the baby <i>coyotes</i>, and Sour-Mash and her pups, and
Sardanapalus and her kittens&mdash;hang these names she gives the
creatures, they warp my jaw&mdash;and Potter: you&mdash;all
sitting around in the house, and Soldier Boy at the window the
entire time, it&rsquo;s a wonder to me she comes along as well as
she does.&nbsp; She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want her all to yourself, you stingy old
thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marse Tom, you know better.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s too much
company.&nbsp; And then the idea of her receiving reports all the
time from her officers, and acting upon them, and giving orders,
the same as if she was well!&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t good for her,
and the surgeon don&rsquo;t like it, and tried to persuade her
not to and couldn&rsquo;t; and when he <i>ordered</i> her, she
was that outraged and indignant, and was very severe on him, and
accused him of insubordination, and said it didn&rsquo;t become
him to give orders to an officer of her rank.&nbsp; Well, he saw
he had excited her more and done more harm than all the rest put
together, so he was vexed at himself and wished he had kept
still.&nbsp; Doctors <i>don&rsquo;t</i> know much, and
that&rsquo;s a fact.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s too much interested in
things&mdash;she ought to rest more.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s all the
time sending messages to BB, and to soldiers and Injuns and
whatnot, and to the animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the animals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who carries them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes Potter, but mostly it&rsquo;s
Shekels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now come! who can find fault with such pretty
make-believe as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it ain&rsquo;t make-believe, Marse Tom.&nbsp; She
does send them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I don&rsquo;t doubt that part of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you doubt they get them, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; Animals talk to one another.&nbsp; I
know it perfectly well, Marse Tom, and I ain&rsquo;t saying it by
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a curious superstition!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a superstition, Marse Tom.&nbsp; Look at
that Shekels&mdash;look at him, <i>now</i>.&nbsp; Is he
listening, or ain&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; <i>Now</i> you see!
he&rsquo;s turned his head away.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s because he was
caught&mdash;caught in the act.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll ask
you&mdash;could a Christian look any more ashamed than what he
looks now?&mdash;<i>lay down</i>!&nbsp; You see? he was going to
sneak out.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell <i>me</i>, Marse Tom!&nbsp; If
animals don&rsquo;t talk, I miss <i>my</i> guess.&nbsp; And
Shekels is the worst.&nbsp; He goes and tells the animals
everything that happens in the officers&rsquo; quarters; and if
he&rsquo;s short of facts, he invents them.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t
any more principle than a blue jay; and as for morals, he&rsquo;s
empty.&nbsp; Look at him now; look at him grovel.&nbsp; He knows
what I am saying, and he knows it&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; You
see, yourself, that he can feel shame; it&rsquo;s the only virtue
he&rsquo;s got.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wonderful how they find out
everything that&rsquo;s going on&mdash;the animals.&nbsp;
They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe they do, Dorcas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t only just believe it, Marse Tom, I know
it.&nbsp; Day before yesterday they knew something was going to
happen.&nbsp; They were that excited, and whispering around
together; why, anybody could see that they&mdash; But my! I must
get back to her, and I haven&rsquo;t got to my errand
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Dorcas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s two or three things.&nbsp; One is, the
doctor don&rsquo;t salute when he comes . . . Now, Marse Tom, it
ain&rsquo;t anything to laugh at, and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, forgive me; I didn&rsquo;t mean to
laugh&mdash;I got caught unprepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, she don&rsquo;t want to hurt the
doctor&rsquo;s feelings, so she don&rsquo;t say anything to him
about it; but she is always polite, herself, and it hurts that
kind for people to be rude to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that doctor hanged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marse Tom, she don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> him
hanged.&nbsp; She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I&rsquo;ll have him boiled in
oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> him boiled.&nbsp;
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, very well, I only want to please her;
I&rsquo;ll have him skinned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, <i>she</i> don&rsquo;t want him skinned; it would
break her heart.&nbsp; Now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman, this is perfectly unreasonable.&nbsp; What in
the nation <i>does</i> she want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marse Tom, if you would only be a little patient, and
not fly off the handle at the least little thing.&nbsp; Why, she
only wants you to speak to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak to him!&nbsp; Well, upon my word!&nbsp; All this
unseemly rage and row about such a&mdash;a&mdash; Dorcas, I never
saw you carry on like this before.&nbsp; You have alarmed the
sentry; he thinks I am being assassinated; he thinks
there&rsquo;s a mutiny, a revolt, an insurrection;
he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marse Tom, you are just putting on; you know it
perfectly well; I don&rsquo;t know what makes you act like
that&mdash;but you always did, even when you was little, and you
can&rsquo;t get over it, I reckon.&nbsp; Are you over it now,
Marse Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, yes; but it would try anybody to be doing the
best he could, offering every kindness he could think of, only to
have it rejected with contumely and . . . Oh, well, let it go;
it&rsquo;s no matter&mdash;I&rsquo;ll talk to the doctor.&nbsp;
Is that satisfactory, or are you going to break out
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, it is; and it&rsquo;s only right to talk to
him, too, because it&rsquo;s just as she says; she&rsquo;s trying
to keep up discipline in the Rangers, and this insubordination of
his is a bad example for them&mdash;now ain&rsquo;t it so, Marse
Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there <i>is</i> reason in it, I can&rsquo;t deny
it; so I will speak to him, though at bottom I think hanging
would be more lasting.&nbsp; What is the rest of your errand,
Dorcas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course her room is Ranger headquarters now, Marse
Tom, while she&rsquo;s sick.&nbsp; Well, soldiers of the cavalry
and the dragoons that are off duty come and get her sentries to
let them relieve them and serve in their place.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
only out of affection, sir, and because they know military honors
please her, and please the children too, for her sake; and they
don&rsquo;t bring their muskets; and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed them there, but didn&rsquo;t twig
the idea.&nbsp; They are standing guard, are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, and she is afraid you will reprove them and
hurt their feelings, if you see them there; so she begs,
if&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t mind coming in the back
way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear me up, Dorcas; don&rsquo;t let me
faint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&mdash;sit up and behave, Marse Tom.&nbsp; You are
not going to faint; you are only pretending&mdash;you used to act
just so when you was little; it does seem a long time for you to
get grown up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorcas, the way the child is progressing, I shall be
out of my job before long&mdash;she&rsquo;ll have the whole post
in her hands.&nbsp; I must make a stand, I must not go down
without a struggle.&nbsp; These encroachments. . . . Dorcas, what
do you think she will think of next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marse Tom, she don&rsquo;t mean any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Marse Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feel sure she has no ulterior designs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that is, Marse Tom, but I know
she hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, for the present I am satisfied.&nbsp;
What else have you come about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon I better tell you the whole thing first, Marse
Tom, then tell you what she wants.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s been an
emeute, as she calls it.&nbsp; It was before she got back with
BB.&nbsp; The officer of the day reported it to her this
morning.&nbsp; It happened at her fort.&nbsp; There was a fuss
betwixt Major-General Tommy Drake and Lieutenant-Colonel Agnes
Frisbie, and he snatched her doll away, which is made of white
kid stuffed with sawdust, and tore every rag of its clothes off,
right before them all, and is under arrest, and the charge is
conduct un&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know&mdash;conduct unbecoming an officer and a
gentleman&mdash;a plain case, too, it seems to me.&nbsp; This is
a serious matter.&nbsp; Well, what is her pleasure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Marse Tom, she has summoned a court-martial, but
the doctor don&rsquo;t think she is well enough to preside over
it, and she says there ain&rsquo;t anybody competent but her,
because there&rsquo;s a major-general concerned; and so
she&mdash;she&mdash;well, she says, would you preside over it for
her? . . . Marse Tom, <i>sit</i> up!&nbsp; You ain&rsquo;t any
more going to faint than Shekels is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Dorcas, go along back, and be tactful.&nbsp;
Be persuasive; don&rsquo;t fret her; tell her it&rsquo;s all
right, the matter is in my hands, but it isn&rsquo;t good form to
hurry so grave a matter as this.&nbsp; Explain to her that we
have to go by precedents, and that I believe this one to be
new.&nbsp; In fact, you can say I know that nothing just like it
has happened in our army, therefore I must be guided by European
precedents, and must go cautiously and examine them
carefully.&nbsp; Tell her not to be impatient, it will take me
several days, but it will all come out right, and I will come
over and report progress as I go along.&nbsp; Do you get the
idea, Dorcas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I do, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s this.&nbsp; You see, it won&rsquo;t
ever do for me, a brigadier in the regular army, to preside over
that infant court-martial&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t any precedent
for it, don&rsquo;t you see.&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; I will go on
examining authorities and reporting progress until she is well
enough to get me out of this scrape by presiding herself.&nbsp;
Do you get it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, sir, I get it, and it&rsquo;s good, I&rsquo;ll
go and fix it with her.&nbsp; <i>Lay down</i>! and stay where you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what harm is he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it ain&rsquo;t any harm, but it just vexes me to
see him act so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see, and him in such a sweat?&nbsp; He
was starting out to spread it all over the post.&nbsp; <i>Now</i>
I reckon you won&rsquo;t deny, any more, that they go and tell
everything they hear, now that you&rsquo;ve seen it with
yo&rsquo; own eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like to acknowledge it, Dorcas, but
I don&rsquo;t see how I can consistently stick to my doubts in
the face of such overwhelming proof as this dog is
furnishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, you&rsquo;ve got in yo&rsquo; right mind at
last!&nbsp; I wonder you can be so stubborn, Marse Tom.&nbsp; But
you always was, even when you was little.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here; tell her that in view of the delay, it is my
judgment that she ought to enlarge the accused on his
parole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I&rsquo;ll tell her.&nbsp; Marse
Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t get to Soldier Boy, and he stands there
all the time, down in the mouth and lonesome; and she says will
you shake hands with him and comfort him?&nbsp; Everybody
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curious kind of lonesomeness; but, all
right, I will.&rdquo;</p>

Bill had with the late Blake Haskins and his pal a few months
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is Mongrel&mdash;and not a half-bad horse,

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed he keeps up his lick
first-rate.&nbsp; Say&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it a gaudy
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorndike, it&rsquo;s Andalusian! and when that&rsquo;s
said, all&rsquo;s said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andalusian <i>and</i> Oregonian, Antonio!&nbsp; Put it
that way, and you have my vote.&nbsp; Being a native up there, I
know.&nbsp; You being Andalusian-born&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can speak with authority for that patch of
paradise?&nbsp; Well, I can.&nbsp; Like the Don! like
Sancho!&nbsp; This is the correct Andalusian dawn

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What though the spicy breezes<br />
Blow soft o&rsquo;er Ceylon&rsquo;s isle&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;<i>git</i> up, you old cow! stumbling like that when
we&rsquo;ve just been praising you! out on a scout and
can&rsquo;t live up to the honor any better than that?&nbsp;
Antonio, how long have you been out here in the Plains and the
Rockies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than thirteen years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long time.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you ever get
homesick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why <i>now</i>?&mdash;after such a long
cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These preparations of the retiring commandant&rsquo;s
have started it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s natural.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It keeps me thinking about Spain.&nbsp; I know the
region where the Seventh&rsquo;s child&rsquo;s aunt lives; I know
all the lovely country for miles around; I&rsquo;ll bet
I&rsquo;ve seen her aunt&rsquo;s villa many a time; I&rsquo;ll
bet I&rsquo;ve been in it in those pleasant old times when I was
a Spanish gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say the child is wild to see Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so; I know it from what I hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you talked with her about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve avoided it.&nbsp; I should soon be
as wild as she is.&nbsp; That would not be
comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I was going, Antonio.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s two
things I&rsquo;d give a lot to see.&nbsp; One&rsquo;s a
railroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll see one when she strikes
Missouri.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other&rsquo;s a bull-fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen lots of them; I wish I could see
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it, except in a
mixed-up, foggy way, Antonio, but I know enough to know
it&rsquo;s grand sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grandest in the world!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no other
sport that begins with it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you what
I&rsquo;ve seen, then you can judge.&nbsp; It was my first, and
it&rsquo;s as vivid to me now as it was when I saw it.&nbsp; It
was a Sunday afternoon, and beautiful weather, and my uncle, the
priest, took me as a reward for being a good boy and because of
my own accord and without anybody asking me I had bankrupted my
savings-box and given the money to a mission that was civilizing
the Chinese and sweetening their lives and softening their hearts
with the gentle teachings of our religion, and I wish you could
have seen what we saw that day, Thorndike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The amphitheatre was packed, from the bull-ring to the
highest row&mdash;twelve thousand people in one circling mass,
one slanting, solid mass&mdash;royalties, nobles, clergy, ladies,
gentlemen, state officials, generals, admirals, soldiers,
sailors, lawyers, thieves, merchants, brokers, cooks, housemaids,
scullery-maids, doubtful women, dudes, gamblers, beggars,
loafers, tramps, American ladies, gentlemen, preachers, English
ladies, gentlemen, preachers, German ditto, French ditto, and so
on and so on, all the world represented: Spaniards to admire and
praise, foreigners to enjoy and go home and find
fault&mdash;there they were, one solid, sloping, circling sweep
of rippling and flashing color under the downpour of the summer
sun&mdash;just a garden, a gaudy, gorgeous flower-garden!&nbsp;
Children munching oranges, six thousand fans fluttering and
glimmering, everybody happy, everybody chatting gayly with their
intimates, lovely girl-faces smiling recognition and salutation
to other lovely girl-faces, gray old ladies and gentlemen dealing
in the like exchanges with each other&mdash;ah, such a picture of
cheery contentment and glad anticipation! not a mean spirit, nor
a sordid soul, nor a sad heart there&mdash;ah, Thorndike, I wish
I could see it again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly, the martial note of a bugle cleaves the hum
and murmur&mdash;clear the ring!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They clear it.&nbsp; The great gate is flung open, and
the procession marches in, splendidly costumed and glittering:
the marshals of the day, then the picadores on horseback, then
the matadores on foot, each surrounded by his quadrille of
<i>chulos</i>.&nbsp; They march to the box of the city fathers,
and formally salute.&nbsp; The key is thrown, the bull-gate is
unlocked.&nbsp; Another bugle blast&mdash;the gate flies open,
the bull plunges in, furious, trembling, blinking in the blinding
light, and stands there, a magnificent creature, centre of those
multitudinous and admiring eyes, brave, ready for battle, his
attitude a challenge.&nbsp; He sees his enemy: horsemen sitting
motionless, with long spears in rest, upon blindfolded
broken-down nags, lean and starved, fit only for sport and
sacrifice, then the carrion-heap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bull makes a rush, with murder in his eye, but a
picador meets him with a spear-thrust in the shoulder.&nbsp; He
flinches with the pain, and the picador skips out of
danger.&nbsp; A burst of applause for the picador, hisses for the
bull.&nbsp; Some shout &lsquo;Cow!&rsquo; at the bull, and call
him offensive names.&nbsp; But he is not listening to them, he is
there for business; he is not minding the cloak-bearers that come
fluttering around to confuse him; he chases this way, he chases
that way, and hither and yon, scattering the nimble banderillos
in every direction like a spray, and receiving their maddening
darts in his neck as they dodge and fly&mdash;oh, but it&rsquo;s
a lively spectacle, and brings down the house!&nbsp; Ah, you
should hear the thundering roar that goes up when the game is at
its wildest and brilliant things are done!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that first bull, that day, was great!&nbsp; From
the moment the spirit of war rose to flood-tide in him and he got
down to his work, he began to do wonders.&nbsp; He tore his way
through his persecutors, flinging one of them clear over the
parapet; he bowled a horse and his rider down, and plunged
straight for the next, got home with his horns, wounding both
horse and man; on again, here and there and this way and that;
and one after another he tore the bowels out of two horses so
that they gushed to the ground, and ripped a third one so badly
that although they rushed him to cover and shoved his bowels back
and stuffed the rents with tow and rode him against the bull
again, he couldn&rsquo;t make the trip; he tried to gallop, under
the spur, but soon reeled and tottered and fell, all in a
heap.&nbsp; For a while, that bull-ring was the most thrilling
and glorious and inspiring sight that ever was seen.&nbsp; The
bull absolutely cleared it, and stood there alone! monarch of the
place.&nbsp; The people went mad for pride in him, and joy and
delight, and you couldn&rsquo;t hear yourself think, for the roar
and boom and crash of applause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Antonio, it carries me clear out of myself just to hear
you tell it; it must have been perfectly splendid.&nbsp; If I
live, I&rsquo;ll see a bull-fight yet before I die.&nbsp; Did
they kill him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; that is what the bull is for.&nbsp; They tired
him out, and got him at last.&nbsp; He kept rushing the matador,
who always slipped smartly and gracefully aside in time, waiting
for a sure chance; and at last it came; the bull made a deadly
plunge for him&mdash;was avoided neatly, and as he sped by, the
long sword glided silently into him, between left shoulder and
spine&mdash;in and in, to the hilt.&nbsp; He crumpled down,
dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Antonio, it <i>is</i> the noblest sport that ever
was.&nbsp; I would give a year of my life to see it.&nbsp; Is the
bull always killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Sometimes a bull is timid, finding himself
in so strange a place, and he stands trembling, or tries to
retreat.&nbsp; Then everybody despises him for his cowardice and
wants him punished and made ridiculous; so they hough him from
behind, and it is the funniest thing in the world to see him
hobbling around on his severed legs; the whole vast house goes
into hurricanes of laughter over it; I have laughed till the
tears ran down my cheeks to see it.&nbsp; When he has furnished
all the sport he can, he is not any longer useful, and is
killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is perfectly grand, Antonio, perfectly
beautiful.&nbsp; Burning a nigger don&rsquo;t begin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sage-Brush</span>, you have been
listening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, Mongrel, I don&rsquo;t know that it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen a good many human beings in my

it.&nbsp; They are only brutal because that is their make; brutes
would be brutal if it was <i>their</i> make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me, Sage-Brush, man is most strange and
unaccountable.&nbsp; Why should he treat dumb animals that way
when they are not doing any harm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man is not always like that, Mongrel; he is kind enough
when he is not excited by religion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the bull-fight a religious service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&nbsp; I have heard so.&nbsp; It is held on
Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">GENERAL ALISON TO HIS MOTHER</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a prodigious trip, but
delightful, of course, through the Rockies and the Black Hills
and the mighty sweep of the Great Plains to civilization and the
Missouri border&mdash;where the railroading began and the
delightfulness ended.&nbsp; But no one is the worse for the
journey; certainly not Cathy, nor Dorcas, nor Soldier Boy; and as
for me, I am not complaining.</p>
<p>Spain is all that Cathy had pictured it&mdash;and more, she
says.&nbsp; She is in a fury of delight, the maddest little
animal that ever was, and all for joy.&nbsp; She thinks she
remembers Spain, but that is not very likely, I suppose.&nbsp;
The two&mdash;Mercedes and Cathy&mdash;devour each other.&nbsp;
It is a rapture of love, and beautiful to see.&nbsp; It is
Spanish; that describes it.&nbsp; Will this be a short visit?</p>
<p>No.&nbsp; It will be permanent.&nbsp; Cathy has elected to
abide with Spain and her aunt.&nbsp; Dorcas says she (Dorcas)
foresaw that this would happen; and also says that she wanted it
to happen, and says the child&rsquo;s own country is the right
place for her, and that she ought not to have been sent to me, I
ought to have gone to her.&nbsp; I thought it insane to take
Soldier Boy to Spain, but it was well that I yielded to
Cathy&rsquo;s pleadings; if he had been left behind, half of her
heart would have remained with him, and she would not have been
contented.&nbsp; As it is, everything has fallen out for the
best, and we are all satisfied and comfortable.&nbsp; It may be
that Dorcas and I will see America again some day; but also it is
a case of maybe not.</p>
<p>We left the post in the early morning.&nbsp; It was an
affecting time.&nbsp; The women cried over Cathy, so did even
those stern warriors, the Rocky Mountain Rangers; Shekels was
there, and the Cid, and Sardanapalus, and Potter, and Mongrel,
and Sour-Mash, Famine, and Pestilence, and Cathy kissed them all
and wept; details of the several arms of the garrison were
present to represent the rest, and say good-bye and God bless you
for all the soldiery; and there was a special squad from the
Seventh, with the oldest veteran at its head, to speed the
Seventh&rsquo;s Child with grand honors and impressive
ceremonies; and the veteran had a touching speech by heart, and
put up his hand in salute and tried to say it, but his lips
trembled and his voice broke, but Cathy bent down from the saddle
and kissed him on the mouth and turned his defeat to victory, and
a cheer went up.</p>
<p>The next act closed the ceremonies, and was a moving
surprise.&nbsp; It may be that you have discovered, before this,
that the rigors of military law and custom melt insensibly away
and disappear when a soldier or a regiment or the garrison wants
to do something that will please Cathy.&nbsp; The bands conceived
the idea of stirring her soldierly heart with a farewell which
would remain in her memory always, beautiful and unfading, and
bring back the past and its love for her whenever she should
think of it; so they got their project placed before General
Burnaby, my successor, who is Cathy&rsquo;s newest slave, and in
spite of poverty of precedents they got his permission.&nbsp; The
bands knew the child&rsquo;s favorite military airs.&nbsp; By
this hint you know what is coming, but Cathy didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
She was asked to sound the &ldquo;reveille,&rdquo; which she
did.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p138b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Reveille [music score]"
title=
"Reveille [music score]"
 src="images/p138s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>With the last note the bands burst out with a crash: and woke
the mountains with the &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; in a
way to make a body&rsquo;s heart swell and thump and his hair
rise!&nbsp; It was enough to break a person all up, to see
Cathy&rsquo;s radiant face shining out through her gladness and
tears.&nbsp; By request she blew the &ldquo;assembly,&rdquo; now.
. . .</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p139ab.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Assembly [music score]"
title=
"The Assembly [music score]"
 src="images/p139as.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>. . . Then the bands thundered in, with &ldquo;Rally round the
flag, boys, rally once again!&rdquo;&nbsp; Next, she blew another
call (&ldquo;to the Standard&rdquo;) . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p139bb.jpg">
<img alt=
"To the Standard [music score]"
title=
"To the Standard [music score]"
 src="images/p139bs.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>. . . and the bands responded with &ldquo;When we were
marching through Georgia.&rdquo;&nbsp; Straightway she sounded
&ldquo;boots and saddles,&rdquo; that thrilling and most
expediting call. . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p140b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Boots and Saddles [music score]"
title=
"Boots and Saddles [music score]"
 src="images/p140s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>and the bands could hardly hold in for the final note; then
they turned their whole strength loose on &ldquo;Tramp, tramp,
tramp, the boys are marching,&rdquo; and everybody&rsquo;s
excitement rose to blood-heat.</p>
<p>Now an impressive pause&mdash;then the bugle sang &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Taps</span>&rdquo;&mdash;translatable, this time,
into &ldquo;Good-bye, and God keep us all!&rdquo; for taps is the
soldier&rsquo;s nightly release from duty, and farewell:
plaintive, sweet, pathetic, for the morning is never sure, for
him; always it is possible that he is hearing it for the last
time. . . .</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p141b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Taps [music score]"
title=
"Taps [music score]"
 src="images/p141s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>. . . Then the bands turned their instruments towards Cathy
and burst in with that rollicking frenzy of a tune, &ldquo;Oh,
we&rsquo;ll all get blind drunk when Johnny comes marching
home&mdash;yes, we&rsquo;ll all get blind drunk when Johnny comes
marching home!&rdquo; and followed it instantly with
&ldquo;Dixie,&rdquo; that antidote for melancholy, merriest and
gladdest of all military music on any side of the ocean&mdash;and
that was the end.&nbsp; And so&mdash;farewell!</p>
<p>I wish you could have been there to see it all, hear it all,
and feel it: and get yourself blown away with the hurricane huzza
that swept the place as a finish.</p>
<p>When we rode away, our main body had already been on the road
an hour or two&mdash;I speak of our camp equipage; but we
didn&rsquo;t move off alone: when Cathy blew the
&ldquo;advance&rdquo; the Rangers cantered out in column of
fours, and gave us escort, and were joined by White Cloud and
Thunder-Bird in all their gaudy bravery, and by Buffalo Bill and
four subordinate scouts.&nbsp; Three miles away, in the Plains,
the Lieutenant-General halted, sat her horse like a military
statue, the bugle at her lips, and put the Rangers through the
evolutions for half an hour; and finally, when she blew the
&ldquo;charge,&rdquo; she led it herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not for
the last time,&rdquo; she said, and got a cheer, and we said
good-bye all around, and faced eastward and rode away.</p>
<p><i>Postscript</i>.&nbsp; <i>A Day Later</i>.&nbsp; Soldier Boy
was stolen last night.&nbsp; Cathy is almost beside herself, and
we cannot comfort her.&nbsp; Mercedes and I are not much alarmed
about the horse, although this part of Spain is in something of a
turmoil, politically, at present, and there is a good deal of
lawlessness.&nbsp; In ordinary times the thief and the horse
would soon be captured.&nbsp; We shall have them before long, I
think.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">SOLDIER BOY&mdash;TO HIMSELF</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is five months.&nbsp; Or is it
six?&nbsp; My troubles have clouded my memory.&nbsp; I have been
all over this land, from end to end, and now I am back again
since day before yesterday, to that city which we passed through,
that last day of our long journey, and which is near her country
home.&nbsp; I am a tottering ruin and my eyes are dim, but I
recognized it.&nbsp; If she could see me she would know me and
sound my call.&nbsp; I wish I could hear it once more; it would
revive me, it would bring back her face and the mountains and the
free life, and I would come&mdash;if I were dying I would
come!&nbsp; She would not know <i>me</i>, looking as I do, but
she would know me by my star.&nbsp; But she will never see me,
for they do not let me out of this shabby stable&mdash;a foul and
miserable place, with most two wrecks like myself for
company.</p>
<p>How many times have I changed hands?&nbsp; I think it is
twelve times&mdash;I cannot remember; and each time it was down a
step lower, and each time I got a harder master.&nbsp; They have
been cruel, every one; they have worked me night and day in
degraded employments, and beaten me; they have fed me ill, and
some days not at all.&nbsp; And so I am but bones, now, with a
rough and frowsy skin humped and cornered upon my shrunken
body&mdash;that skin which was once so glossy, that skin which
she loved to stroke with her hand.&nbsp; I was the pride of the
mountains and the Great Plains; now I am a scarecrow and
despised.&nbsp; These piteous wrecks that are my comrades here
say we have reached the bottom of the scale, the final
humiliation; they say that when a horse is no longer worth the
weeds and discarded rubbish they feed to him, they sell him to
the bull-ring for a glass of brandy, to make sport for the people
and perish for their pleasure.</p>
<p>To die&mdash;that does not disturb me; we of the service never
care for death.&nbsp; But if I could see her once more! if I
could hear her bugle sing again and say, &ldquo;It is I,
Soldier&mdash;come!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">GENERAL ALISON TO MRS. DRAKE, THE
COLONEL&rsquo;S WIFE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> return, now, to where I was, and
tell you the rest.&nbsp; We shall never know how she came to be
there; there is no way to account for it.&nbsp; She was always
watching for black and shiny and spirited horses&mdash;watching,
hoping, despairing, hoping again; always giving chase and
sounding her call, upon the meagrest chance of a response, and
breaking her heart over the disappointment; always inquiring,
always interested in sales-stables and horse accumulations in
general.&nbsp; How she got there must remain a mystery.</p>
<p>At the point which I had reached in a preceding paragraph of
this account, the situation was as follows: two horses lay dying;
the bull had scattered his persecutors for the moment, and stood
raging, panting, pawing the dust in clouds over his back, when
the man that had been wounded returned to the ring on a remount,
a poor blindfolded wreck that yet had something ironically
military about his bearing&mdash;and the next moment the bull had
ripped him open and his bowls were dragging upon the ground: and
the bull was charging his swarm of pests again.&nbsp; Then came
pealing through the air a bugle-call that froze my
blood&mdash;&ldquo;<i>It is I</i>,
<i>Soldier&mdash;come</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; I turned; Cathy was
flying down through the massed people; she cleared the parapet at
a bound, and sped towards that riderless horse, who staggered
forward towards the remembered sound; but his strength failed,
and he fell at her feet, she lavishing kisses upon him and
sobbing, the house rising with one impulse, and white with
horror!&nbsp; Before help could reach her the bull was back
again&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image150" href="images/p150b.jpg">
<img alt=
"His strength failed, and he fell at her feet"
title=
"His strength failed, and he fell at her feet"
 src="images/p150s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>She was never conscious again in life.&nbsp; We bore her home,
all mangled and drenched in blood, and knelt by her and listened
to her broken and wandering words, and prayed for her passing
spirit, and there was no comfort&mdash;nor ever will be, I
think.&nbsp; But she was happy, for she was far away under
another sky, and comrading again with her Rangers, and her animal
friends, and the soldiers.&nbsp; Their names fell softly and
caressingly from her lips, one by one, with pauses between.&nbsp;
She was not in pain, but lay with closed eyes, vacantly
murmuring, as one who dreams.&nbsp; Sometimes she smiled, saying
nothing; sometimes she smiled when she uttered a name&mdash;such
as Shekels, or BB, or Potter.&nbsp; Sometimes she was at her
fort, issuing commands; sometimes she was careering over the
plain at the head of her men; sometimes she was training her
horse; once she said, reprovingly, &ldquo;You are giving me the
wrong foot; give me the left&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know it is
good-bye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this, she lay silent some time; the end was near.&nbsp;
By-and-by she murmured, &ldquo;Tired . . . sleepy . . . take
Cathy, mamma.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;Kiss me,
Soldier.&rdquo;&nbsp; For a little time, she lay so still that we
were doubtful if she breathed.&nbsp; Then she put out her hand
and began to feel gropingly about; then said, &ldquo;I cannot
find it; blow &lsquo;taps.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the
end.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
