<h1>THE MAN THAT CORRUPTED HADLEYBURG</h1>
<h2>I.</h2>
<p>It was many years ago.&nbsp; Hadleyburg was the most honest and upright
town in all the region round about.&nbsp; It had kept that reputation
unsmirched during three generations, and was prouder of it than of any
other of its possessions.&nbsp; It was so proud of it, and so anxious
to insure its perpetuation, that it began to teach the principles of
honest dealing to its babies in the cradle, and made the like teachings
the staple of their culture thenceforward through all the years devoted
to their education.&nbsp; Also, throughout the formative years temptations
were kept out of the way of the young people, so that their honesty
could have every chance to harden and solidify, and become a part of
their very bone.&nbsp; The neighbouring towns were jealous of this honourable
supremacy, and affected to sneer at Hadleyburg&rsquo;s pride in it and
call it vanity; but all the same they were obliged to acknowledge that
Hadleyburg was in reality an incorruptible town; and if pressed they
would also acknowledge that the mere fact that a young man hailed from
Hadleyburg was all the recommendation he needed when he went forth from
his natal town to seek for responsible employment.</p>
<p>But at last, in the drift of time, Hadleyburg had the ill luck to
offend a passing stranger&mdash;possibly without knowing it, certainly
without caring, for Hadleyburg was sufficient unto itself, and cared
not a rap for strangers or their opinions.&nbsp; Still, it would have
been well to make an exception in this one&rsquo;s case, for he was
a bitter man, and revengeful.&nbsp; All through his wanderings during
a whole year he kept his injury in mind, and gave all his leisure moments
to trying to invent a compensating satisfaction for it.&nbsp; He contrived
many plans, and all of them were good, but none of them was quite sweeping
enough: the poorest of them would hurt a great many individuals, but
what he wanted was a plan which would comprehend the entire town, and
not let so much as one person escape unhurt.&nbsp; At last he had a
fortunate idea, and when it fell into his brain it lit up his whole
head with an evil joy.&nbsp; He began to form a plan at once, saying
to himself &ldquo;That is the thing to do&mdash;I will corrupt the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six months later he went to Hadleyburg, and arrived in a buggy at
the house of the old cashier of the bank about ten at night.&nbsp; He
got a sack out of the buggy, shouldered it, and staggered with it through
the cottage yard, and knocked at the door.&nbsp; A woman&rsquo;s voice
said &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; and he entered, and set his sack behind
the stove in the parlour, saying politely to the old lady who sat reading
the &ldquo;Missionary Herald&rdquo; by the lamp:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray keep your seat, madam, I will not disturb you.&nbsp;
There&mdash;now it is pretty well concealed; one would hardly know it
was there.&nbsp; Can I see your husband a moment, madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, he was gone to Brixton, and might not return before morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, madam, it is no matter.&nbsp; I merely wanted to
leave that sack in his care, to be delivered to the rightful owner when
he shall be found.&nbsp; I am a stranger; he does not know me; I am
merely passing through the town to-night to discharge a matter which
has been long in my mind.&nbsp; My errand is now completed, and I go
pleased and a little proud, and you will never see me again.&nbsp; There
is a paper attached to the sack which will explain everything.&nbsp;
Good-night, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old lady was afraid of the mysterious big stranger, and was glad
to see him go.&nbsp; But her curiosity was roused, and she went straight
to the sack and brought away the paper.&nbsp; It began as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;TO BE PUBLISHED, or, the right man sought out
by private inquiry&mdash;either will answer.&nbsp; This sack contains
gold coin weighing a hundred and sixty pounds four ounces&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us, and the door not locked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Richards flew to it all in a tremble and locked it, then pulled
down the window-shades and stood frightened, worried, and wondering
if there was anything else she could do toward making herself and the
money more safe.&nbsp; She listened awhile for burglars, then surrendered
to curiosity, and went back to the lamp and finished reading the paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am a foreigner, and am presently going back
to my own country, to remain there permanently.&nbsp; I am grateful
to America for what I have received at her hands during my long stay
under her flag; and to one of her citizens&mdash;a citizen of Hadleyburg&mdash;I
am especially grateful for a great kindness done me a year or two ago.&nbsp;
Two great kindnesses in fact.&nbsp; I will explain.&nbsp; I was a gambler.&nbsp;
I say I WAS.&nbsp; I was a ruined gambler.&nbsp; I arrived in this village
at night, hungry and without a penny.&nbsp; I asked for help&mdash;in
the dark; I was ashamed to beg in the light.&nbsp; I begged of the right
man.&nbsp; He gave me twenty dollars&mdash;that is to say, he gave me
life, as I considered it.&nbsp; He also gave me fortune; for out of
that money I have made myself rich at the gaming-table.&nbsp; And finally,
a remark which he made to me has remained with me to this day, and has
at last conquered me; and in conquering has saved the remnant of my
morals: I shall gamble no more.&nbsp; Now I have no idea who that man
was, but I want him found, and I want him to have this money, to give
away, throw away, or keep, as he pleases.&nbsp; It is merely my way
of testifying my gratitude to him.&nbsp; If I could stay, I would find
him myself; but no matter, he will be found.&nbsp; This is an honest
town, an incorruptible town, and I know I can trust it without fear.&nbsp;
This man can be identified by the remark which he made to me; I feel
persuaded that he will remember it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now my plan is this: If you prefer to conduct the inquiry
privately, do so.&nbsp; Tell the contents of this present writing to
any one who is likely to be the right man.&nbsp; If he shall answer,
&lsquo;I am the man; the remark I made was so-and-so,&rsquo; apply the
test&mdash;to wit: open the sack, and in it you will find a sealed envelope
containing that remark.&nbsp; If the remark mentioned by the candidate
tallies with it, give him the money, and ask no further questions, for
he is certainly the right man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you shall prefer a public inquiry, then publish this
present writing in the local paper&mdash;with these instructions added,
to wit: Thirty days from now, let the candidate appear at the town-hall
at eight in the evening (Friday), and hand his remark, in a sealed envelope,
to the Rev. Mr. Burgess (if he will be kind enough to act); and let
Mr. Burgess there and then destroy the seals of the sack, open it, and
see if the remark is correct: if correct, let the money be delivered,
with my sincere gratitude, to my benefactor thus identified.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Richards sat down, gently quivering with excitement, and was
soon lost in thinkings&mdash;after this pattern: &ldquo;What a strange
thing it is! . . . And what a fortune for that kind man who set his
bread afloat upon the waters! . . . If it had only been my husband that
did it!&mdash;for we are so poor, so old and poor! . . .&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, with a sigh&mdash;&ldquo;But it was not my Edward; no, it was
not he that gave a stranger twenty dollars.&nbsp; It is a pity too;
I see it now. . . &rdquo;&nbsp; Then, with a shudder&mdash;&ldquo;But
it is <i>gamblers</i>&rsquo; money! the wages of sin; we couldn&rsquo;t
take it; we couldn&rsquo;t touch it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like to be
near it; it seems a defilement.&rdquo;&nbsp; She moved to a farther
chair. . . &ldquo;I wish Edward would come, and take it to the bank;
a burglar might come at any moment; it is dreadful to be here all alone
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At eleven Mr. Richards arrived, and while his wife was saying &ldquo;I
am <i>so</i> glad you&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;I
am so tired&mdash;tired clear out; it is dreadful to be poor, and have
to make these dismal journeys at my time of life.&nbsp; Always at the
grind, grind, grind, on a salary&mdash;another man&rsquo;s slave, and
he sitting at home in his slippers, rich and comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry for you, Edward, you know that; but be comforted;
we have our livelihood; we have our good name&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mary, and that is everything.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t mind
my talk&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a moment&rsquo;s irritation and doesn&rsquo;t
mean anything.&nbsp; Kiss me&mdash;there, it&rsquo;s all gone now, and
I am not complaining any more.&nbsp; What have you been getting?&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s in the sack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his wife told him the great secret.&nbsp; It dazed him for a
moment; then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It weighs a hundred and sixty pounds?&nbsp; Why, Mary, it&rsquo;s
for-ty thou-sand dollars&mdash;think of it&mdash;a whole fortune!&nbsp;
Not ten men in this village are worth that much.&nbsp; Give me the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He skimmed through it and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it an adventure!&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s a romance;
it&rsquo;s like the impossible things one reads about in books, and
never sees in life.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was well stirred up now; cheerful,
even gleeful.&nbsp; He tapped his old wife on the cheek, and said humorously,
&ldquo;Why, we&rsquo;re rich, Mary, rich; all we&rsquo;ve got to do
is to bury the money and burn the papers.&nbsp; If the gambler ever
comes to inquire, we&rsquo;ll merely look coldly upon him and say: &lsquo;What
is this nonsense you are talking?&nbsp; We have never heard of you and
your sack of gold before;&rsquo; and then he would look foolish, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime, while you are running on with your jokes,
the money is still here, and it is fast getting along toward burglar-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True.&nbsp; Very well, what shall we do&mdash;make the inquiry
private?&nbsp; No, not that; it would spoil the romance.&nbsp; The public
method is better.&nbsp; Think what a noise it will make!&nbsp; And it
will make all the other towns jealous; for no stranger would trust such
a thing to any town but Hadleyburg, and they know it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a great card for us.&nbsp; I must get to the printing-office now, or
I shall be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But stop&mdash;stop&mdash;don&rsquo;t leave me here alone
with it, Edward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was gone.&nbsp; For only a little while, however.&nbsp; Not
far from his own house he met the editor&mdash;proprietor of the paper,
and gave him the document, and said &ldquo;Here is a good thing for
you, Cox&mdash;put it in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be too late, Mr. Richards, but I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At home again, he and his wife sat down to talk the charming mystery
over; they were in no condition for sleep.&nbsp; The first question
was, Who could the citizen have been who gave the stranger the twenty
dollars?&nbsp; It seemed a simple one; both answered it in the same
breath&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barclay Goodson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Richards, &ldquo;he could have done it, and
it would have been like him, but there&rsquo;s not another in the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody will grant that, Edward&mdash;grant it privately,
anyway.&nbsp; For six months, now, the village has been its own proper
self once more&mdash;honest, narrow, self-righteous, and stingy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is what he always called it, to the day of his death&mdash;said
it right out publicly, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and he was hated for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course; but he didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; I reckon he
was the best-hated man among us, except the Reverend Burgess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Burgess deserves it&mdash;he will never get another
congregation here.&nbsp; Mean as the town is, it knows how to estimate
<i>him</i>.&nbsp; Edward, doesn&rsquo;t it seem odd that the stranger
should appoint Burgess to deliver the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;it does.&nbsp; That is&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so much that-<i>is</i>-ing?&nbsp; Would <i>you</i> select
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, maybe the stranger knows him better than this village
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much <i>that</i> would help Burgess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband seemed perplexed for an answer; the wife kept a steady
eye upon him, and waited.&nbsp; Finally Richards said, with the hesitancy
of one who is making a statement which is likely to encounter doubt,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, Burgess is not a bad man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife was certainly surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not a bad man.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; The whole of his
unpopularity had its foundation in that one thing&mdash;the thing that
made so much noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That &lsquo;one thing,&rsquo; indeed!&nbsp; As if that &lsquo;one
thing&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t enough, all by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty.&nbsp; Plenty.&nbsp; Only he wasn&rsquo;t guilty of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you talk!&nbsp; Not guilty of it!&nbsp; Everybody knows
he <i>was</i> guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, I give you my word&mdash;he was innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it and I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; How do you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a confession.&nbsp; I am ashamed, but I will make it.&nbsp;
I was the only man who knew he was innocent.&nbsp; I could have saved
him, and&mdash;and&mdash;well, you know how the town was wrought up&mdash;I
hadn&rsquo;t the pluck to do it.&nbsp; It would have turned everybody
against me.&nbsp; I felt mean, ever so mean; ut I didn&rsquo;t dare;
I hadn&rsquo;t the manliness to face that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary looked troubled, and for a while was silent.&nbsp; Then she
said stammeringly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think it would have done for you to&mdash;to&mdash;One
mustn&rsquo;t&mdash;er&mdash;public opinion&mdash;one has to be so careful&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
It was a difficult road, and she got mired; but after a little she got
started again.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a great pity, but&mdash;Why, we couldn&rsquo;t
afford it, Edward&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t indeed.&nbsp; Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t
have had you do it for anything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have lost us the good-will of so many people, Mary;
and then&mdash;and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What troubles me now is, what <i>he</i> thinks of us, Edward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He?&nbsp; <i>He</i> doesn&rsquo;t suspect that I could have
saved him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed the wife, in a tone of relief, &ldquo;I
am glad of that.&nbsp; As long as he doesn&rsquo;t know that you could
have saved him, he&mdash;he&mdash;well that makes it a great deal better.&nbsp;
Why, I might have known he didn&rsquo;t know, because he is always trying
to be friendly with us, as little encouragement as we give him.&nbsp;
More than once people have twitted me with it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the
Wilsons, and the Wilcoxes, and the Harknesses, they take a mean pleasure
in saying &lsquo;<i>Your friend</i> Burgess,&rsquo; because they know
it pesters me.&nbsp; I wish he wouldn&rsquo;t persist in liking us so;
I can&rsquo;t think why he keeps it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can explain it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s another confession.&nbsp;
When the thing was new and hot, and the town made a plan to ride him
on a rail, my conscience hurt me so that I couldn&rsquo;t stand it,
and I went privately and gave him notice, and he got out of the town
and stayed out till it was safe to come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward!&nbsp; If the town had found it out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Don&rsquo;t</i>!&nbsp; It scares me yet, to think of it.&nbsp;
I repented of it the minute it was done; and I was even afraid to tell
you lest your face might betray it to somebody.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
sleep any that night, for worrying.&nbsp; But after a few days I saw
that no one was going to suspect me, and after that I got to feeling
glad I did it.&nbsp; And I feel glad yet, Mary&mdash;glad through and
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, now, for it would have been a dreadful way to treat
him.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;m glad; for really you did owe him that, you
know.&nbsp; But, Edward, suppose it should come out yet, some day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because everybody thinks it was Goodson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course they would!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&nbsp; And of course <i>he</i> didn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp;
They persuaded poor old Sawlsberry to go and charge it on him, and he
went blustering over there and did it.&nbsp; Goodson looked him over,
like as if he was hunting for a place on him that he could despise the
most; then he says, &lsquo;So you are the Committee of Inquiry, are
you?&rsquo;&nbsp; Sawlsberry said that was about what he was.&nbsp;
&lsquo;H&rsquo;m.&nbsp; Do they require particulars, or do you reckon
a kind of a <i>general</i> answer will do?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;If they
require particulars, I will come back, Mr. Goodson; I will take the
general answer first.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well, then, tell them
to go to hell&mdash;I reckon that&rsquo;s general enough.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;ll give you some advice, Sawlsberry; when you come back for
the particulars, fetch a basket to carry what is left of yourself home
in.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like Goodson; it&rsquo;s got all the marks.&nbsp; He
had only one vanity; he thought he could give advice better than any
other person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It settled the business, and saved us, Mary.&nbsp; The subject
was dropped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless you, I&rsquo;m not doubting <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they took up the gold-sack mystery again, with strong interest.&nbsp;
Soon the conversation began to suffer breaks&mdash;interruptions caused
by absorbed thinkings.&nbsp; The breaks grew more and more frequent.&nbsp;
At last Richards lost himself wholly in thought.&nbsp; He sat long,
gazing vacantly at the floor, and by-and-by he began to punctuate his
thoughts with little nervous movements of his hands that seemed to indicate
vexation.&nbsp; Meantime his wife too had relapsed into a thoughtful
silence, and her movements were beginning to show a troubled discomfort.&nbsp;
Finally Richards got up and strode aimlessly about the room, ploughing
his hands through his hair, much as a somnambulist might do who was
having a bad dream.&nbsp; Then he seemed to arrive at a definite purpose;
and without a word he put on his hat and passed quickly out of the house.&nbsp;
His wife sat brooding, with a drawn face, and did not seem to be aware
that she was alone.&nbsp; Now and then she murmured, &ldquo;Lead us
not into t . . . but&mdash;but&mdash;we are so poor, so poor! . . .
Lead us not into . . . Ah, who would be hurt by it?&mdash;and no one
would ever know . . . Lead us . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; The voice died out
in mumblings.&nbsp; After a little she glanced up and muttered in a
half-frightened, half-glad way&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is gone!&nbsp; But, oh dear, he may be too late&mdash;too
late . . . Maybe not&mdash;maybe there is still time.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
rose and stood thinking, nervously clasping and unclasping her hands.&nbsp;
A slight shudder shook her frame, and she said, out of a dry throat,
&ldquo;God forgive me&mdash;it&rsquo;s awful to think such things&mdash;but
. . . Lord, how we are made&mdash;how strangely we are made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned the light low, and slipped stealthily over and knelt down
by the sack and felt of its ridgy sides with her hands, and fondled
them lovingly; and there was a gloating light in her poor old eyes.&nbsp;
She fell into fits of absence; and came half out of them at times to
mutter &ldquo;If we had only waited!&mdash;oh, if we had only waited
a little, and not been in such a hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime Cox had gone home from his office and told his wife all
about the strange thing that had happened, and they had talked it over
eagerly, and guessed that the late Goodson was the only man in the town
who could have helped a suffering stranger with so noble a sum as twenty
dollars.&nbsp; Then there was a pause, and the two became thoughtful
and silent.&nbsp; And by-and-by nervous and fidgety.&nbsp; At last the
wife said, as if to herself,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows this secret but the Richardses . . . and us .
. . nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The husband came out of his thinkings with a slight start, and gazed
wistfully at his wife, whose face was become very pale; then he hesitatingly
rose, and glanced furtively at his hat, then at his wife&mdash;a sort
of mute inquiry.&nbsp; Mrs. Cox swallowed once or twice, with her hand
at her throat, then in place of speech she nodded her head.&nbsp; In
a moment she was alone, and mumbling to herself.</p>
<p>And now Richards and Cox were hurrying through the deserted streets,
from opposite directions.&nbsp; They met, panting, at the foot of the
printing-office stairs; by the night-light there they read each other&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; Cox whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows about this but us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whispered answer was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul&mdash;on honour, not a soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t too late to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men were starting up-stairs; at this moment they were overtaken
by a boy, and Cox asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t ship the early mail&mdash;nor <i>any</i>
mail; wait till I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s already gone, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Gone</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; It had the sound of an unspeakable
disappointment in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; Time-table for Brixton and all the towns beyond
changed to-day, sir&mdash;had to get the papers in twenty minutes earlier
than common.&nbsp; I had to rush; if I had been two minutes later&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men turned and walked slowly away, not waiting to hear the rest.&nbsp;
Neither of them spoke during ten minutes; then Cox said, in a vexed
tone,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What possessed you to be in such a hurry, <i>I</i> can&rsquo;t
make out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was humble enough:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it now, but somehow I never thought, you know, until
it was too late.&nbsp; But the next time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time be hanged!&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t come in a thousand
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the friends separated without a good-night, and dragged themselves
home with the gait of mortally stricken men.&nbsp; At their homes their
wives sprang up with an eager &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;&mdash;then saw the
answer with their eyes and sank down sorrowing, without waiting for
it to come in words.&nbsp; In both houses a discussion followed of a
heated sort&mdash;a new thing; there had been discussions before, but
not heated ones, not ungentle ones.&nbsp; The discussions to-night were
a sort of seeming plagiarisms of each other.&nbsp; Mrs. Richards said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had only waited, Edward&mdash;if you had only stopped
to think; but no, you must run straight to the printing-office and spread
it all over the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>said</i> publish it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is nothing; it also said do it privately, if you liked.&nbsp;
There, now&mdash;is that true, or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;yes, it is true; but when I thought what a
stir it would make, and what a compliment it was to Hadleyburg that
a stranger should trust it so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly, I know all that; but if you had only stopped
to think, you would have seen that you <i>couldn&rsquo;t</i> find the
right man, because he is in his grave, and hasn&rsquo;t left chick nor
child nor relation behind him; and as long as the money went to somebody
that awfully needed it, and nobody would be hurt by it, and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke down, crying.&nbsp; Her husband tried to think of some
comforting thing to say, and presently came out with this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after all, Mary, it must be for the best&mdash;it must
be; we know that.&nbsp; And we must remember that it was so ordered&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordered!&nbsp; Oh, everything&rsquo;s <i>ordered</i>, when
a person has to find some way out when he has been stupid. Just the
same, it was <i>ordered</i> that the money should come to us in this
special way, and it was you that must take it on yourself to go meddling
with the designs of Providence&mdash;and who gave you the right?&nbsp;
It was wicked, that is what it was&mdash;just blasphemous presumption,
and no more becoming to a meek and humble professor of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mary, you know how we have been trained all our lives
long, like the whole village, till it is absolutely second nature to
us to stop not a single moment to think when there&rsquo;s an honest
thing to be done&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know it, I know it&mdash;it&rsquo;s been one everlasting
training and training and training in honesty&mdash;honesty shielded,
from the very cradle, against every possible temptation, and so it&rsquo;s
<i>artificial</i> honesty, and weak as water when temptation comes,
as we have seen this night.&nbsp; God knows I never had shade nor shadow
of a doubt of my petrified and indestructible honesty until now&mdash;and
now, under the very first big and real temptation, I&mdash;Edward, it
is my belief that this town&rsquo;s honesty is as rotten as mine is;
as rotten as yours.&nbsp; It is a mean town, a hard, stingy town, and
hasn&rsquo;t a virtue in the world but this honesty it is so celebrated
for and so conceited about; and so help me, I do believe that if ever
the day comes that its honesty falls under great temptation, its grand
reputation will go to ruin like a house of cards.&nbsp; There, now,
I&rsquo;ve made confession, and I feel better; I am a humbug, and I&rsquo;ve
been one all my life, without knowing it.&nbsp; Let no man call me honest
again&mdash;I will not have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;Well, Mary, I feel a good deal as you do: I certainly
do.&nbsp; It seems strange, too, so strange.&nbsp; I never could have
believed it&mdash;never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long silence followed; both were sunk in thought.&nbsp; At last
the wife looked up and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you are thinking, Edward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richards had the embarrassed look of a person who is caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed to confess it, Mary, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no matter, Edward, I was thinking the same question
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&nbsp; State it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were thinking, if a body could only guess out <i>what
the remark was</i> that Goodson made to the stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly true.&nbsp; I feel guilty and ashamed.&nbsp;
And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m past it.&nbsp; Let us make a pallet here; we&rsquo;ve
got to stand watch till the bank vault opens in the morning and admits
the sack. . . Oh dear, oh dear&mdash;if we hadn&rsquo;t made the mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pallet was made, and Mary said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The open sesame&mdash;what could it have been?&nbsp; I do
wonder what that remark could have been.&nbsp; But come; we will get
to bed now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the Coxes too had completed their spat and their reconciliation,
and were turning in&mdash;to think, to think, and toss, and fret, and
worry over what the remark could possibly have been which Goodson made
to the stranded derelict; that golden remark; that remark worth forty
thousand dollars, cash.</p>
<p>The reason that the village telegraph-office was open later than
usual that night was this: The foreman of Cox&rsquo;s paper was the
local representative of the Associated Press.&nbsp; One might say its
honorary representative, for it wasn&rsquo;t four times a year that
he could furnish thirty words that would be accepted.&nbsp; But this
time it was different.&nbsp; His despatch stating what he had caught
got an instant answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Send the whole thing&mdash;all the details&mdash;twelve
hundred words.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A colossal order!&nbsp; The foreman filled the bill; and he was the
proudest man in the State.&nbsp; By breakfast-time the next morning
the name of Hadleyburg the Incorruptible was on every lip in America,
from Montreal to the Gulf, from the glaciers of Alaska to the orange-groves
of Florida; and millions and millions of people were discussing the
stranger and his money-sack, and wondering if the right man would be
found, and hoping some more news about the matter would come soon&mdash;right
away.</p>
<h2>II.</h2>
<p>Hadleyburg village woke up world-celebrated&mdash;astonished&mdash;happy&mdash;vain.&nbsp;
Vain beyond imagination.&nbsp; Its nineteen principal citizens and their
wives went about shaking hands with each other, and beaming, and smiling,
and congratulating, and saying <i>this</i> thing adds a new word to
the dictionary&mdash;<i>Hadleyburg</i>, synonym for <i>incorruptible</i>&mdash;destined
to live in dictionaries for ever!&nbsp; And the minor and unimportant
citizens and their wives went around acting in much the same way.&nbsp;
Everybody ran to the bank to see the gold-sack; and before noon grieved
and envious crowds began to flock in from Brixton and all neighbouring
towns; and that afternoon and next day reporters began to arrive from
everywhere to verify the sack and its history and write the whole thing
up anew, and make dashing free-hand pictures of the sack, and of Richards&rsquo;s
house, and the bank, and the Presbyterian church, and the Baptist church,
and the public square, and the town-hall where the test would be applied
and the money delivered; and damnable portraits of the Richardses, and
Pinkerton the banker, and Cox, and the foreman, and Reverend Burgess,
and the postmaster&mdash;and even of Jack Halliday, who was the loafing,
good-natured, no-account, irreverent fisherman, hunter, boys&rsquo;
friend, stray-dogs&rsquo; friend, typical &ldquo;Sam Lawson&rdquo; of
the town.&nbsp; The little mean, smirking, oily Pinkerton showed the
sack to all comers, and rubbed his sleek palms together pleasantly,
and enlarged upon the town&rsquo;s fine old reputation for honesty and
upon this wonderful endorsement of it, and hoped and believed that the
example would now spread far and wide over the American world, and be
epoch-making in the matter of moral regeneration.&nbsp; And so on, and
so on.</p>
<p>By the end of a week things had quieted down again; the wild intoxication
of pride and joy had sobered to a soft, sweet, silent delight&mdash;a
sort of deep, nameless, unutterable content.&nbsp; All faces bore a
look of peaceful, holy happiness.</p>
<p>Then a change came.&nbsp; It was a gradual change; so gradual that
its beginnings were hardly noticed; maybe were not noticed at all, except
by Jack Halliday, who always noticed everything; and always made fun
of it, too, no matter what it was.&nbsp; He began to throw out chaffing
remarks about people not looking quite so happy as they did a day or
two ago; and next he claimed that the new aspect was deepening to positive
sadness; next, that it was taking on a sick look; and finally he said
that everybody was become so moody, thoughtful, and absent-minded that
he could rob the meanest man in town of a cent out of the bottom of
his breeches pocket and not disturb his reverie.</p>
<p>At this stage&mdash;or at about this stage&mdash;a saying like this
was dropped at bedtime&mdash;with a sigh, usually&mdash;by the head
of each of the nineteen principal households:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what <i>could</i> have been the remark that Goodson made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And straightway&mdash;with a shudder&mdash;came this, from the man&rsquo;s
wife:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>don&rsquo;t</i>!&nbsp; What horrible thing are you
mulling in your mind?&nbsp; Put it away from you, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But that question was wrung from those men again the next night&mdash;and
got the same retort.&nbsp; But weaker.</p>
<p>And the third night the men uttered the question yet again&mdash;with
anguish, and absently.&nbsp; This time&mdash;and the following night&mdash;the
wives fidgeted feebly, and tried to say something.&nbsp; But didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And the night after that they found their tongues and responded&mdash;longingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, if we <i>could</i> only guess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Halliday&rsquo;s comments grew daily more and more sparklingly disagreeable
and disparaging.&nbsp; He went diligently about, laughing at the town,
individually and in mass.&nbsp; But his laugh was the only one left
in the village: it fell upon a hollow and mournful vacancy and emptiness.&nbsp;
Not even a smile was findable anywhere.&nbsp; Halliday carried a cigar-box
around on a tripod, playing that it was a camera, and halted all passers
and aimed the thing and said &ldquo;Ready!&mdash;now look pleasant,
please,&rdquo; but not even this capital joke could surprise the dreary
faces into any softening.</p>
<p>So three weeks passed&mdash;one week was left.&nbsp; It was Saturday
evening after supper.&nbsp; Instead of the aforetime Saturday-evening
flutter and bustle and shopping and larking, the streets were empty
and desolate.&nbsp; Richards and his old wife sat apart in their little
parlour&mdash;miserable and thinking.&nbsp; This was become their evening
habit now: the life-long habit which had preceded it, of reading, knitting,
and contented chat, or receiving or paying neighbourly calls, was dead
and gone and forgotten, ages ago&mdash;two or three weeks ago; nobody
talked now, nobody read, nobody visited&mdash;the whole village sat
at home, sighing, worrying, silent.&nbsp; Trying to guess out that remark.</p>
<p>The postman left a letter.&nbsp; Richards glanced listlessly at the
superscription and the post-mark&mdash;unfamiliar, both&mdash;and tossed
the letter on the table and resumed his might-have-beens and his hopeless
dull miseries where he had left them off.&nbsp; Two or three hours later
his wife got wearily up and was going away to bed without a good-night&mdash;custom
now&mdash;but she stopped near the letter and eyed it awhile with a
dead interest, then broke it open, and began to skim it over.&nbsp;
Richards, sitting there with his chair tilted back against the wall
and his chin between his knees, heard something fall.&nbsp; It was his
wife.&nbsp; He sprang to her side, but she cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me alone, I am too happy.&nbsp; Read the letter&mdash;read
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did.&nbsp; He devoured it, his brain reeling.&nbsp; The letter
was from a distant State, and it said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am a stranger to you, but no matter: I have
something to tell.&nbsp; I have just arrived home from Mexico, and learned
about that episode.&nbsp; Of course you do not know who made that remark,
but I know, and I am the only person living who does know.&nbsp; It
was GOODSON.&nbsp; I knew him well, many years ago.&nbsp; I passed through
your village that very night, and was his guest till the midnight train
came along.&nbsp; I overheard him make that remark to the stranger in
the dark&mdash;it was in Hale Alley.&nbsp; He and I talked of it the
rest of the way home, and while smoking in his house.&nbsp; He mentioned
many of your villagers in the course of his talk&mdash;most of them
in a very uncomplimentary way, but two or three favourably: among these
latter yourself.&nbsp; I say &lsquo;favourably&rsquo;&mdash;nothing
stronger.&nbsp; I remember his saying he did not actually LIKE any person
in the town&mdash;not one; but that you&mdash;I THINK he said you&mdash;am
almost sure&mdash;had done him a very great service once, possibly without
knowing the full value of it, and he wished he had a fortune, he would
leave it to you when he died, and a curse apiece for the rest of the
citizens.&nbsp; Now, then, if it was you that did him that service,
you are his legitimate heir, and entitled to the sack of gold.&nbsp;
I know that I can trust to your honour and honesty, for in a citizen
of Hadleyburg these virtues are an unfailing inheritance, and so I am
going to reveal to you the remark, well satisfied that if you are not
the right man you will seek and find the right one and see that poor
Goodson&rsquo;s debt of gratitude for the service referred to is paid.&nbsp;
This is the remark &lsquo;YOU ARE FAR FROM BEING A BAD MAN: GO, AND
REFORM.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;HOWARD L. STEPHENSON.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Edward, the money is ours, and I am so grateful, <i>oh</i>,
so grateful,&mdash;kiss me, dear, it&rsquo;s for ever since we kissed&mdash;and
we needed it so&mdash;the money&mdash;and now you are free of Pinkerton
and his bank, and nobody&rsquo;s slave any more; it seems to me I could
fly for joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a happy half-hour that the couple spent there on the settee
caressing each other; it was the old days come again&mdash;days that
had begun with their courtship and lasted without a break till the stranger
brought the deadly money.&nbsp; By-and-by the wife said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Edward, how lucky it was you did him that grand service,
poor Goodson!&nbsp; I never liked him, but I love him now.&nbsp; And
it was fine and beautiful of you never to mention it or brag about it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then, with a touch of reproach, &ldquo;But you ought to have told <i>me</i>,
Edward, you ought to have told your wife, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash;er&mdash;well, Mary, you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now stop hemming and hawing, and tell me about it, Edward.&nbsp;
I always loved you, and now I&rsquo;m proud of you.&nbsp; Everybody
believes there was only one good generous soul in this village, and
now it turns out that you&mdash;Edward, why don&rsquo;t you tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;Why, Mary, I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>can&rsquo;t</i>?&nbsp; <i>Why</i> can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, he&mdash;well, he&mdash;he made me promise I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wife looked him over, and said, very slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made&mdash;you&mdash;promise?&nbsp; Edward, what do you tell
me that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, do you think I would lie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was troubled and silent for a moment, then she laid her hand
within his and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No . . . no.&nbsp; We have wandered far enough from our bearings&mdash;God
spare us that!&nbsp; In all your life you have never uttered a lie.&nbsp;
But now&mdash;now that the foundations of things seem to be crumbling
from under us, we&mdash;we&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She lost her voice for
a moment, then said, brokenly, &ldquo;Lead us not into temptation. .
. I think you made the promise, Edward.&nbsp; Let it rest so.&nbsp;
Let us keep away from that ground.&nbsp; Now&mdash;that is all gone
by; let us he happy again; it is no time for clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward found it something of an effort to comply, for his mind kept
wandering&mdash;trying to remember what the service was that he had
done Goodson.</p>
<p>The couple lay awake the most of the night, Mary happy and busy,
Edward busy, but not so happy.&nbsp; Mary was planning what she would
do with the money.&nbsp; Edward was trying to recall that service.&nbsp;
At first his conscience was sore on account of the lie he had told Mary&mdash;if
it was a lie.&nbsp; After much reflection&mdash;suppose it <i>was</i>
a lie?&nbsp; What then?&nbsp; Was it such a great matter?&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t
we always <i>acting</i> lies?&nbsp; Then why not tell them?&nbsp; Look
at Mary&mdash;look what she had done.&nbsp; While he was hurrying off
on his honest errand, what was she doing?&nbsp; Lamenting because the
papers hadn&rsquo;t been destroyed and the money kept.&nbsp; Is theft
better than lying?</p>
<p><i>That</i> point lost its sting&mdash;the lie dropped into the background
and left comfort behind it.&nbsp; The next point came to the front:
<i>had</i> he rendered that service?&nbsp; Well, here was Goodson&rsquo;s
own evidence as reported in Stephenson&rsquo;s letter; there could be
no better evidence than that&mdash;it was even <i>proof</i> that he
had rendered it.&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; So that point was settled. .
. No, not quite.&nbsp; He recalled with a wince that this unknown Mr.
Stephenson was just a trifle unsure as to whether the performer of it
was Richards or some other&mdash;and, oh dear, he had put Richards on
his honour!&nbsp; He must himself decide whither that money must go&mdash;and
Mr. Stephenson was not doubting that if he was the wrong man he would
go honourably and find the right one.&nbsp; Oh, it was odious to put
a man in such a situation&mdash;ah, why couldn&rsquo;t Stephenson have
left out that doubt?&nbsp; What did he want to intrude that for?</p>
<p>Further reflection.&nbsp; How did it happen that <i>Richards&rsquo;s</i>
name remained in Stephenson&rsquo;s mind as indicating the right man,
and not some other man&rsquo;s name?&nbsp; That looked good.&nbsp; Yes,
that looked very good.&nbsp; In fact it went on looking better and better,
straight along&mdash;until by-and-by it grew into positive <i>proof</i>.&nbsp;
And then Richards put the matter at once out of his mind, for he had
a private instinct that a proof once established is better left so.</p>
<p>He was feeling reasonably comfortable now, but there was still one
other detail that kept pushing itself on his notice: of course he had
done that service&mdash;that was settled; but what <i>was</i> that service?&nbsp;
He must recall it&mdash;he would not go to sleep till he had recalled
it; it would make his peace of mind perfect.&nbsp; And so he thought
and thought.&nbsp; He thought of a dozen things&mdash;possible services,
even probable services&mdash;but none of them seemed adequate, none
of them seemed large enough, none of them seemed worth the money&mdash;worth
the fortune Goodson had wished he could leave in his will.&nbsp; And
besides, he couldn&rsquo;t remember having done them, anyway.&nbsp;
Now, then&mdash;now, then&mdash;what <i>kind</i> of a service would
it be that would make a man so inordinately grateful?&nbsp; Ah&mdash;the
saving of his soul!&nbsp; That must be it.&nbsp; Yes, he could remember,
now, how he once set himself the task of converting Goodson, and laboured
at it as much as&mdash;he was going to say three months; but upon closer
examination it shrunk to a month, then to a week, then to a day, then
to nothing.&nbsp; Yes, he remembered now, and with unwelcome vividness,
that Goodson had told him to go to thunder and mind his own business&mdash;<i>he</i>
wasn&rsquo;t hankering to follow Hadleyburg to heaven!</p>
<p>So that solution was a failure&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t saved Goodson&rsquo;s
soul.&nbsp; Richards was discouraged.&nbsp; Then after a little came
another idea: had he saved Goodson&rsquo;s property?&nbsp; No, that
wouldn&rsquo;t do&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t any.&nbsp; His life?&nbsp; That
is it!&nbsp; Of course.&nbsp; Why, he might have thought of it before.&nbsp;
This time he was on the right track, sure.&nbsp; His imagination-mill
was hard at work in a minute, now.</p>
<p>Thereafter, during a stretch of two exhausting hours, he was busy
saving Goodson&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; He saved it in all kinds of difficult
and perilous ways.&nbsp; In every case he got it saved satisfactorily
up to a certain point; then, just as he was beginning to get well persuaded
that it had really happened, a troublesome detail would turn up which
made the whole thing impossible.&nbsp; As in the matter of drowning,
for instance.&nbsp; In that case he had swum out and tugged Goodson
ashore in an unconscious state with a great crowd looking on and applauding,
but when he had got it all thought out and was just beginning to remember
all about it, a whole swarm of disqualifying details arrived on the
ground: the town would have known of the circumstance, Mary would have
known of it, it would glare like a limelight in his own memory instead
of being an inconspicuous service which he had possibly rendered &ldquo;without
knowing its full value.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at this point he remembered
that he couldn&rsquo;t swim anyway.</p>
<p>Ah&mdash;<i>there</i> was a point which he had been overlooking from
the start: it had to be a service which he had rendered &ldquo;possibly
without knowing the full value of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why, really, that
ought to be an easy hunt&mdash;much easier than those others.&nbsp;
And sure enough, by-and-by he found it.&nbsp; Goodson, years and years
ago, came near marrying a very sweet and pretty girl, named Nancy Hewitt,
but in some way or other the match had been broken off; the girl died,
Goodson remained a bachelor, and by-and-by became a soured one and a
frank despiser of the human species.&nbsp; Soon after the girl&rsquo;s
death the village found out, or thought it had found out, that she carried
a spoonful of negro blood in her veins.&nbsp; Richards worked at these
details a good while, and in the end he thought he remembered things
concerning them which must have gotten mislaid in his memory through
long neglect.&nbsp; He seemed to dimly remember that it was <i>he</i>
that found out about the negro blood; that it was he that told the village;
that the village told Goodson where they got it; that he thus saved
Goodson from marrying the tainted girl; that he had done him this great
service &ldquo;without knowing the full value of it,&rdquo; in fact
without knowing that he <i>was</i> doing it; but that Goodson knew the
value of it, and what a narrow escape he had had, and so went to his
grave grateful to his benefactor and wishing he had a fortune to leave
him.&nbsp; It was all clear and simple, now, and the more he went over
it the more luminous and certain it grew; and at last, when he nestled
to sleep, satisfied and happy, he remembered the whole thing just as
if it had been yesterday.&nbsp; In fact, he dimly remembered Goodson&rsquo;s
<i>telling</i> him his gratitude once.&nbsp; Meantime Mary had spent
six thousand dollars on a new house for herself and a pair of slippers
for her pastor, and then had fallen peacefully to rest.</p>
<p>That same Saturday evening the postman had delivered a letter to
each of the other principal citizens&mdash;nineteen letters in all.&nbsp;
No two of the envelopes were alike, and no two of the superscriptions
were in the same hand, but the letters inside were just like each other
in every detail but one.&nbsp; They were exact copies of the letter
received by Richards&mdash;handwriting and all&mdash;and were all signed
by Stephenson, but in place of Richards&rsquo;s name each receiver&rsquo;s
own name appeared.</p>
<p>All night long eighteen principal citizens did what their caste-brother
Richards was doing at the same time&mdash;they put in their energies
trying to remember what notable service it was that they had unconsciously
done Barclay Goodson.&nbsp; In no case was it a holiday job; still they
succeeded.</p>
<p>And while they were at this work, which was difficult, their wives
put in the night spending the money, which was easy.&nbsp; During that
one night the nineteen wives spent an average of seven thousand dollars
each out of the forty thousand in the sack&mdash;a hundred and thirty-three
thousand altogether.</p>
<p>Next day there was a surprise for Jack Halliday.&nbsp; He noticed
that the faces of the nineteen chief citizens and their wives bore that
expression of peaceful and holy happiness again.&nbsp; He could not
understand it, neither was he able to invent any remarks about it that
could damage it or disturb it.&nbsp; And so it was his turn to be dissatisfied
with life.&nbsp; His private guesses at the reasons for the happiness
failed in all instances, upon examination.&nbsp; When he met Mrs. Wilcox
and noticed the placid ecstasy in her face, he said to himself, &ldquo;Her
cat has had kittens&rdquo;&mdash;and went and asked the cook; it was
not so, the cook had detected the happiness, but did not know the cause.&nbsp;
When Halliday found the duplicate ecstasy in the face of &ldquo;Shadbelly&rdquo;
Billson (village nickname), he was sure some neighbour of Billson&rsquo;s
had broken his leg, but inquiry showed that this had not happened.&nbsp;
The subdued ecstasy in Gregory Yates&rsquo;s face could mean but one
thing&mdash;he was a mother-in-law short; it was another mistake.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And Pinkerton&mdash;Pinkerton&mdash;he has collected ten cents
that he thought he was going to lose.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so on, and so
on.&nbsp; In some cases the guesses had to remain in doubt, in the others
they proved distinct errors.&nbsp; In the end Halliday said to himself,
&ldquo;Anyway it roots up that there&rsquo;s nineteen Hadleyburg families
temporarily in heaven: I don&rsquo;t know how it happened; I only know
Providence is off duty to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An architect and builder from the next State had lately ventured
to set up a small business in this unpromising village, and his sign
had now been hanging out a week.&nbsp; Not a customer yet; he was a
discouraged man, and sorry he had come.&nbsp; But his weather changed
suddenly now.&nbsp; First one and then another chief citizen&rsquo;s
wife said to him privately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to my house Monday week&mdash;but say nothing about it
for the present.&nbsp; We think of building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got eleven invitations that day.&nbsp; That night he wrote his
daughter and broke off her match with her student.&nbsp; He said she
could marry a mile higher than that.</p>
<p>Pinkerton the banker and two or three other well-to-do men planned
country-seats&mdash;but waited.&nbsp; That kind don&rsquo;t count their
chickens until they are hatched.</p>
<p>The Wilsons devised a grand new thing&mdash;a fancy-dress ball.&nbsp;
They made no actual promises, but told all their acquaintanceship in
confidence that they were thinking the matter over and thought they
should give it&mdash;&ldquo;and if we do, you will be invited, of course.&rdquo;&nbsp;
People were surprised, and said, one to another, &ldquo;Why, they are
crazy, those poor Wilsons, they can&rsquo;t afford it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Several among the nineteen said privately to their husbands, &ldquo;It
is a good idea, we will keep still till their cheap thing is over, then
<i>we</i> will give one that will make it sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The days drifted along, and the bill of future squanderings rose
higher and higher, wilder and wilder, more and more foolish and reckless.&nbsp;
It began to look as if every member of the nineteen would not only spend
his whole forty thousand dollars before receiving-day, but be actually
in debt by the time he got the money.&nbsp; In some cases light-headed
people did not stop with planning to spend, they really spent&mdash;on
credit.&nbsp; They bought land, mortgages, farms, speculative stocks,
fine clothes, horses, and various other things, paid down the bonus,
and made themselves liable for the rest&mdash;at ten days.&nbsp; Presently
the sober second thought came, and Halliday noticed that a ghastly anxiety
was beginning to show up in a good many faces.&nbsp; Again he was puzzled,
and didn&rsquo;t know what to make of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Wilcox kittens
aren&rsquo;t dead, for they weren&rsquo;t born; nobody&rsquo;s broken
a leg; there&rsquo;s no shrinkage in mother-in-laws; <i>nothing</i>
has happened&mdash;it is an insolvable mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another puzzled man, too&mdash;the Rev. Mr. Burgess.&nbsp;
For days, wherever he went, people seemed to follow him or to be watching
out for him; and if he ever found himself in a retired spot, a member
of the nineteen would be sure to appear, thrust an envelope privately
into his hand, whisper &ldquo;To be opened at the town-hall Friday evening,&rdquo;
then vanish away like a guilty thing.&nbsp; He was expecting that there
might be one claimant for the sack&mdash;doubtful, however, Goodson
being dead&mdash;but it never occurred to him that all this crowd might
be claimants.&nbsp; When the great Friday came at last, he found that
he had nineteen envelopes.</p>
<h2>III.</h2>
<p>The town-hall had never looked finer.&nbsp; The platform at the end
of it was backed by a showy draping of flags; at intervals along the
walls were festoons of flags; the gallery fronts were clothed in flags;
the supporting columns were swathed in flags; all this was to impress
the stranger, for he would be there in considerable force, and in a
large degree he would be connected with the press.&nbsp; The house was
full.&nbsp; The 412 fixed seats were occupied; also the 68 extra chairs
which had been packed into the aisles; the steps of the platform were
occupied; some distinguished strangers were given seats on the platform;
at the horseshoe of tables which fenced the front and sides of the platform
sat a strong force of special correspondents who had come from everywhere.&nbsp;
It was the best-dressed house the town had ever produced.&nbsp; There
were some tolerably expensive toilets there, and in several cases the
ladies who wore them had the look of being unfamiliar with that kind
of clothes.&nbsp; At least the town thought they had that look, but
the notion could have arisen from the town&rsquo;s knowledge of the
fact that these ladies had never inhabited such clothes before.</p>
<p>The gold-sack stood on a little table at the front of the platform
where all the house could see it.&nbsp; The bulk of the house gazed
at it with a burning interest, a mouth-watering interest, a wistful
and pathetic interest; a minority of nineteen couples gazed at it tenderly,
lovingly, proprietarily, and the male half of this minority kept saying
over to themselves the moving little impromptu speeches of thankfulness
for the audience&rsquo;s applause and congratulations which they were
presently going to get up and deliver.&nbsp; Every now and then one
of these got a piece of paper out of his vest pocket and privately glanced
at it to refresh his memory.</p>
<p>Of course there was a buzz of conversation going on&mdash;there always
is; but at last, when the Rev. Mr. Burgess rose and laid his hand on
the sack, he could hear his microbes gnaw, the place was so still.&nbsp;
He related the curious history of the sack, then went on to speak in
warm terms of Hadleyburg&rsquo;s old and well-earned reputation for
spotless honesty, and of the town&rsquo;s just pride in this reputation.&nbsp;
He said that this reputation was a treasure of priceless value; that
under Providence its value had now become inestimably enhanced, for
the recent episode had spread this fame far and wide, and thus had focussed
the eyes of the American world upon this village, and made its name
for all time, as he hoped and believed, a synonym for commercial incorruptibility.&nbsp;
[Applause.]&nbsp; &ldquo;And who is to be the guardian of this noble
fame&mdash;the community as a whole?&nbsp; No!&nbsp; The responsibility
is individual, not communal.&nbsp; From this day forth each and every
one of you is in his own person its special guardian, and individually
responsible that no harm shall come to it.&nbsp; Do you&mdash;does each
of you&mdash;accept this great trust?&nbsp; [Tumultuous assent.]&nbsp;
Then all is well.&nbsp; Transmit it to your children and to your children&rsquo;s
children.&nbsp; To-day your purity is beyond reproach&mdash;see to it
that it shall remain so.&nbsp; To-day there is not a person in your
community who could be beguiled to touch a penny not his own&mdash;see
to it that you abide in this grace.&nbsp; [&ldquo;We will! we will!&rdquo;]&nbsp;
This is not the place to make comparisons between ourselves and other
communities&mdash;some of them ungracious towards us; they have their
ways, we have ours; let us be content.&nbsp; [Applause.]&nbsp; I am
done.&nbsp; Under my hand, my friends, rests a stranger&rsquo;s eloquent
recognition of what we are; through him the world will always henceforth
know what we are.&nbsp; We do not know who he is, but in your name I
utter your gratitude, and ask you to raise your voices in indorsement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house rose in a body and made the walls quake with the thunders
of its thankfulness for the space of a long minute.&nbsp; Then it sat
down, and Mr. Burgess took an envelope out of his pocket.&nbsp; The
house held its breath while he slit the envelope open and took from
it a slip of paper.&nbsp; He read its contents&mdash;slowly and impressively&mdash;the
audience listening with tranced attention to this magic document, each
of whose words stood for an ingot of gold:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The remark which I made to the distressed stranger
was this: &ldquo;You are very far from being a bad man; go, and reform.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he continued:&mdash;&ldquo;We shall know in a moment now whether
the remark here quoted corresponds with the one concealed in the sack;
and if that shall prove to be so&mdash;and it undoubtedly will&mdash;this
sack of gold belongs to a fellow-citizen who will henceforth stand before
the nation as the symbol of the special virtue which has made our town
famous throughout the land&mdash;Mr. Billson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house had gotten itself all ready to burst into the proper tornado
of applause; but instead of doing it, it seemed stricken with a paralysis;
there was a deep hush for a moment or two, then a wave of whispered
murmurs swept the place&mdash;of about this tenor: &ldquo;<i>Billson</i>!
oh, come, this is <i>too</i> thin!&nbsp; Twenty dollars to a stranger&mdash;or
<i>anybody</i>&mdash;<i>Billson</i>!&nbsp; Tell it to the marines!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And now at this point the house caught its breath all of a sudden in
a new access of astonishment, for it discovered that whereas in one
part of the hall Deacon Billson was standing up with his head weekly
bowed, in another part of it Lawyer Wilson was doing the same.&nbsp;
There was a wondering silence now for a while.&nbsp; Everybody was puzzled,
and nineteen couples were surprised and indignant.</p>
<p>Billson and Wilson turned and stared at each other.&nbsp; Billson
asked, bitingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do <i>you</i> rise, Mr. Wilson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have a right to.&nbsp; Perhaps you will be good
enough to explain to the house why <i>you</i> rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With great pleasure.&nbsp; Because I wrote that paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an impudent falsity!&nbsp; I wrote it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Burgess&rsquo;s turn to be paralysed.&nbsp; He stood looking
vacantly at first one of the men and then the other, and did not seem
to know what to do.&nbsp; The house was stupefied.&nbsp; Lawyer Wilson
spoke up now, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask the Chair to read the name signed to that paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That brought the Chair to itself, and it read out the name:</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Wharton <i>Billson</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; shouted Billson, &ldquo;what have you got to
say for yourself now?&nbsp; And what kind of apology are you going to
make to me and to this insulted house for the imposture which you have
attempted to play here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No apologies are due, sir; and as for the rest of it, I publicly
charge you with pilfering my note from Mr. Burgess and substituting
a copy of it signed with your own name.&nbsp; There is no other way
by which you could have gotten hold of the test-remark; I alone, of
living men, possessed the secret of its wording.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was likely to be a scandalous state of things if this went
on; everybody noticed with distress that the shorthand scribes were
scribbling like mad; many people were crying &ldquo;Chair, chair!&nbsp;
Order! order!&rdquo;&nbsp; Burgess rapped with his gavel, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us not forget the proprieties due.&nbsp; There has evidently
been a mistake somewhere, but surely that is all.&nbsp; If Mr. Wilson
gave me an envelope&mdash;and I remember now that he did&mdash;I still
have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took one out of his pocket, opened it, glanced at it, looked surprised
and worried, and stood silent a few moments.&nbsp; Then he waved his
hand in a wandering and mechanical way, and made an effort or two to
say something, then gave it up, despondently.&nbsp; Several voices cried
out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it! read it!&nbsp; What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he began, in a dazed and sleep-walker fashion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The remark which I made to the unhappy stranger was
this: &ldquo;You are far from being a bad man.&nbsp; [The house gazed
at him marvelling.]&nbsp; Go, and reform.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; [Murmurs:
&ldquo;Amazing! what can this mean?&rdquo;]&nbsp; This one,&rdquo; said
the Chair, &ldquo;is signed Thurlow G. Wilson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried Wilson, &ldquo;I reckon that settles it!&nbsp;
I knew perfectly well my note was purloined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purloined!&rdquo; retorted Billson.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
let you know that neither you nor any man of your kidney must venture
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chair: &ldquo;Order, gentlemen, order!&nbsp; Take your seats,
both of you, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They obeyed, shaking their heads and grumbling angrily.&nbsp; The
house was profoundly puzzled; it did not know what to do with this curious
emergency.&nbsp; Presently Thompson got up.&nbsp; Thompson was the hatter.&nbsp;
He would have liked to be a Nineteener; but such was not for him; his
stock of hats was not considerable enough for the position.&nbsp; He
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, if I may be permitted to make a suggestion,
can both of these gentlemen be right?&nbsp; I put it to you, sir, can
both have happened to say the very same words to the stranger?&nbsp;
It seems to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tanner got up and interrupted him.&nbsp; The tanner was a disgruntled
man; he believed himself entitled to be a Nineteener, but he couldn&rsquo;t
get recognition.&nbsp; It made him a little unpleasant in his ways and
speech.&nbsp; Said he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sho, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> not the point!&nbsp; <i>That</i>
could happen&mdash;twice in a hundred years&mdash;but not the other
thing.&nbsp; <i>Neither</i> of them gave the twenty dollars!&rdquo;&nbsp;
[A ripple of applause.]</p>
<p>Billson.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilson.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then each accused the other of pilfering.</p>
<p>The Chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Order!&nbsp; Sit down, if you please&mdash;both
of you.&nbsp; Neither of the notes has been out of my possession at
any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Good&mdash;that settles <i>that</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tanner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Chairman, one thing is now plain: one
of these men has been eavesdropping under the other one&rsquo;s bed,
and filching family secrets.&nbsp; If it is not unparliamentary to suggest
it, I will remark that both are equal to it.&nbsp; [The Chair.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Order! order!&rdquo;]&nbsp; I withdraw the remark, sir, and will
confine myself to suggesting that <i>if</i> one of them has overheard
the other reveal the test-remark to his wife, we shall catch him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tanner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Easily.&nbsp; The two have not quoted the
remark in exactly the same words.&nbsp; You would have noticed that,
if there hadn&rsquo;t been a considerable stretch of time and an exciting
quarrel inserted between the two readings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Name the difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tanner.&nbsp; &ldquo;The word <i>very</i> is in Billson&rsquo;s
note, and not in the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many Voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so&mdash;he&rsquo;s right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tanner.&nbsp; &ldquo;And so, if the Chair will examine the test-remark
in the sack, we shall know which of these two frauds&mdash;[The Chair.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Order!&rdquo;]&mdash;which of these two adventurers&mdash;[The
Chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Order! order!&rdquo;]&mdash;which of these two gentlemen&mdash;[laughter
and applause]&mdash;is entitled to wear the belt as being the first
dishonest blatherskite ever bred in this town&mdash;which he has dishonoured,
and which will be a sultry place for him from now out!&rdquo;&nbsp;
[Vigorous applause.]</p>
<p>Many Voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;Open it!&mdash;open the sack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess made a slit in the sack, slid his hand in, and brought
out an envelope.&nbsp; In it were a couple of folded notes.&nbsp; He
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of these is marked, &lsquo;Not to be examined until all
written communications which have been addressed to the Chair&mdash;if
any&mdash;shall have been read.&rsquo;&nbsp; The other is marked &lsquo;<i>The
Test</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Allow me.&nbsp; It is worded&mdash;to wit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I do not require that the first half of the remark
which was made to me by my benefactor shall be quoted with exactness,
for it was not striking, and could be forgotten; but its closing fifteen
words are quite striking, and I think easily rememberable; unless <i>these</i>
shall be accurately reproduced, let the applicant be regarded as an
impostor.&nbsp; My benefactor began by saying he seldom gave advice
to anyone, but that it always bore the hall-mark of high value when
he did give it.&nbsp; Then he said this&mdash;and it has never faded
from my memory: &lsquo;<i>You are far from being a bad man</i>&mdash;&rsquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifty Voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;That settles it&mdash;the money&rsquo;s
Wilson&rsquo;s!&nbsp; Wilson!&nbsp; Wilson!&nbsp; Speech!&nbsp; Speech!&rdquo;</p>
<p>People jumped up and crowded around Wilson, wringing his hand and
congratulating fervently&mdash;meantime the Chair was hammering with
the gavel and shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order, gentlemen!&nbsp; Order!&nbsp; Order!&nbsp; Let me finish
reading, please.&rdquo;&nbsp; When quiet was restored, the reading was
resumed&mdash;as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Go, and reform&mdash;or, mark my words&mdash;some
day, for your sins you will die and go to hell or Hadleyburg</i>&mdash;TRY
AND MAKE IT THE FORMER.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A ghastly silence followed.&nbsp; First an angry cloud began to settle
darkly upon the faces of the citizenship; after a pause the cloud began
to rise, and a tickled expression tried to take its place; tried so
hard that it was only kept under with great and painful difficulty;
the reporters, the Brixtonites, and other strangers bent their heads
down and shielded their faces with their hands, and managed to hold
in by main strength and heroic courtesy.&nbsp; At this most inopportune
time burst upon the stillness the roar of a solitary voice&mdash;Jack
Halliday&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>That&rsquo;s</i> got the hall-mark on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the house let go, strangers and all.&nbsp; Even Mr. Burgess&rsquo;s
gravity broke down presently, then the audience considered itself officially
absolved from all restraint, and it made the most of its privilege.&nbsp;
It was a good long laugh, and a tempestuously wholehearted one, but
it ceased at last&mdash;long enough for Mr. Burgess to try to resume,
and for the people to get their eyes partially wiped; then it broke
out again, and afterward yet again; then at last Burgess was able to
get out these serious words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless to try to disguise the fact&mdash;we find ourselves
in the presence of a matter of grave import.&nbsp; It involves the honour
of your town&mdash;it strikes at the town&rsquo;s good name.&nbsp; The
difference of a single word between the test-remarks offered by Mr.
Wilson and Mr. Billson was itself a serious thing, since it indicated
that one or the other of these gentlemen had committed a theft&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men were sitting limp, nerveless, crushed; but at these words
both were electrified into movement, and started to get up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo; said the Chair, sharply, and they obeyed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That, as I have said, was a serious thing.&nbsp; And it was&mdash;but
for only one of them.&nbsp; But the matter has become graver; for the
honour of <i>both</i> is now in formidable peril.&nbsp; Shall I go even
further, and say in inextricable peril?&nbsp; <i>Both</i> left out the
crucial fifteen words.&rdquo;&nbsp; He paused.&nbsp; During several
moments he allowed the pervading stillness to gather and deepen its
impressive effects, then added: &ldquo;There would seem to be but one
way whereby this could happen.&nbsp; I ask these gentlemen&mdash;Was
there <i>collusion</i>?&mdash;<i>agreement</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low murmur sifted through the house; its import was, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
got them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billson was not used to emergencies; he sat in a helpless collapse.&nbsp;
But Wilson was a lawyer.&nbsp; He struggled to his feet, pale and worried,
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask the indulgence of the house while I explain this most
painful matter.&nbsp; I am sorry to say what I am about to say, since
it must inflict irreparable injury upon Mr. Billson, whom I have always
esteemed and respected until now, and in whose invulnerability to temptation
I entirely believed&mdash;as did you all.&nbsp; But for the preservation
of my own honour I must speak&mdash;and with frankness.&nbsp; I confess
with shame&mdash;and I now beseech your pardon for it&mdash;that I said
to the ruined stranger all of the words contained in the test-remark,
including the disparaging fifteen.&nbsp; [Sensation.]&nbsp; When the
late publication was made I recalled them, and I resolved to claim the
sack of coin, for by every right I was entitled to it.&nbsp; Now I will
ask you to consider this point, and weigh it well; that stranger&rsquo;s
gratitude to me that night knew no bounds; he said himself that he could
find no words for it that were adequate, and that if he should ever
be able he would repay me a thousandfold.&nbsp; Now, then, I ask you
this; could I expect&mdash;could I believe&mdash;could I even remotely
imagine&mdash;that, feeling as he did, he would do so ungrateful a thing
as to add those quite unnecessary fifteen words to his test?&mdash;set
a trap for me?&mdash;expose me as a slanderer of my own town before
my own people assembled in a public hall?&nbsp; It was preposterous;
it was impossible.&nbsp; His test would contain only the kindly opening
clause of my remark.&nbsp; Of that I had no shadow of doubt.&nbsp; You
would have thought as I did.&nbsp; You would not have expected a base
betrayal from one whom you had befriended and against whom you had committed
no offence.&nbsp; And so with perfect confidence, perfect trust, I wrote
on a piece of paper the opening words&mdash;ending with &ldquo;Go, and
reform,&rdquo;&mdash;and signed it.&nbsp; When I was about to put it
in an envelope I was called into my back office, and without thinking
I left the paper lying open on my desk.&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped, turned
his head slowly toward Billson, waited a moment, then added: &ldquo;I
ask you to note this; when I returned, a little latter, Mr. Billson
was retiring by my street door.&rdquo;&nbsp; [Sensation.]</p>
<p>In a moment Billson was on his feet and shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an infamous lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be seated, sir!&nbsp; Mr. Wilson has the
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billson&rsquo;s friends pulled him into his seat and quieted him,
and Wilson went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are the simple facts.&nbsp; My note was now lying in
a different place on the table from where I had left it.&nbsp; I noticed
that, but attached no importance to it, thinking a draught had blown
it there.&nbsp; That Mr. Billson would read a private paper was a thing
which could not occur to me; he was an honourable man, and he would
be above that.&nbsp; If you will allow me to say it, I think his extra
word &lsquo;<i>very</i>&rsquo; stands explained: it is attributable
to a defect of memory.&nbsp; I was the only man in the world who could
furnish here any detail of the test-mark&mdash;by <i>honourable</i>
means.&nbsp; I have finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is nothing in the world like a persuasive speech to fuddle
the mental apparatus and upset the convictions and debauch the emotions
of an audience not practised in the tricks and delusions of oratory.&nbsp;
Wilson sat down victorious.&nbsp; The house submerged him in tides of
approving applause; friends swarmed to him and shook him by the hand
and congratulated him, and Billson was shouted down and not allowed
to say a word.&nbsp; The Chair hammered and hammered with its gavel,
and kept shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let us proceed, gentlemen, let us proceed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last there was a measurable degree of quiet, and the hatter said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is there to proceed with, sir, but to deliver the
money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s it!&nbsp;
Come forward, Wilson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Hatter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I move three cheers for Mr. Wilson, Symbol
of the special virtue which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cheers burst forth before he could finish; and in the midst of
them&mdash;and in the midst of the clamour of the gavel also&mdash;some
enthusiasts mounted Wilson on a big friend&rsquo;s shoulder and were
going to fetch him in triumph to the platform.&nbsp; The Chair&rsquo;s
voice now rose above the noise:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order!&nbsp; To your places!&nbsp; You forget that there is
still a document to be read.&rdquo;&nbsp; When quiet had been restored
he took up the document, and was going to read it, but laid it down
again saying &ldquo;I forgot; this is not to be read until all written
communications received by me have first been read.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
took an envelope out of his pocket, removed its enclosure, glanced at
it&mdash;seemed astonished&mdash;held it out and gazed at it&mdash;stared
at it.</p>
<p>Twenty or thirty voices cried out</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; Read it! read it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he did&mdash;slowly, and wondering:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The remark which I made to the stranger&mdash;[Voices.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hello! how&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;]&mdash;was this: &lsquo;You are
far from being a bad man.&nbsp; [Voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo;]&nbsp;
Go, and reform.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; [Voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, saw my
leg off!&rdquo;]&nbsp; Signed by Mr. Pinkerton the banker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pandemonium of delight which turned itself loose now was of a
sort to make the judicious weep.&nbsp; Those whose withers were unwrung
laughed till the tears ran down; the reporters, in throes of laughter,
set down disordered pot-hooks which would never in the world be decipherable;
and a sleeping dog jumped up scared out of its wits, and barked itself
crazy at the turmoil.&nbsp; All manner of cries were scattered through
the din: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting rich&mdash;<i>two</i> Symbols of
Incorruptibility!&mdash;without counting Billson!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Three</i>!&mdash;count
Shadbelly in&mdash;we can&rsquo;t have too many!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;All
right&mdash;Billson&rsquo;s elected!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Alas, poor
Wilson! victim of <i>two</i> thieves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Powerful Voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Silence!&nbsp; The Chair&rsquo;s fished
up something more out of its pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurrah!&nbsp; Is it something fresh?&nbsp; Read
it! read! read!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chair [reading].&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;The remark which I made,&rsquo;
etc.&nbsp; &lsquo;You are far from being a bad man.&nbsp; Go,&rsquo;
etc.&nbsp; Signed, &lsquo;Gregory Yates.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tornado of Voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;Four Symbols!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;Rah
for Yates!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Fish again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house was in a roaring humour now, and ready to get all the fun
out of the occasion that might be in it.&nbsp; Several Nineteeners,
looking pale and distressed, got up and began to work their way towards
the aisles, but a score of shouts went up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doors, the doors&mdash;close the doors; no Incorruptible
shall leave this place!&nbsp; Sit down, everybody!&rdquo;&nbsp; The
mandate was obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fish again!&nbsp; Read! read!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chair fished again, and once more the familiar words began to
fall from its lips&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;You are far from being a bad
man&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name! name!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;L. Ingoldsby Sargent.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five elected!&nbsp; Pile up the Symbols!&nbsp; Go on, go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are far from being a bad&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name! name!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nicholas Whitworth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hooray! hooray! it&rsquo;s a symbolical day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somebody wailed in, and began to sing this rhyme (leaving out &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&rdquo;)
to the lovely &ldquo;Mikado&rdquo; tune of &ldquo;When a man&rsquo;s
afraid of a beautiful maid;&rdquo; the audience joined in, with joy;
then, just in time, somebody contributed another line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you this forget&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The house roared it out.&nbsp; A third line was at once furnished&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Corruptibles far from Hadleyburg are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The house roared that one too.&nbsp; As the last note died, Jack
Halliday&rsquo;s voice rose high and clear, freighted with a final line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But the Symbols are here, you bet!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was sung, with booming enthusiasm.&nbsp; Then the happy house
started in at the beginning and sang the four lines through twice, with
immense swing and dash, and finished up with a crashing three-times-three
and a tiger for &ldquo;Hadleyburg the Incorruptible and all Symbols
of it which we shall find worthy to receive the hall-mark to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the shoutings at the Chair began again, all over the place:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! go on!&nbsp; Read! read some more!&nbsp; Read all you&rsquo;ve
got!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;go on!&nbsp; We are winning eternal
celebrity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dozen men got up now and began to protest.&nbsp; They said that
this farce was the work of some abandoned joker, and was an insult to
the whole community.&nbsp; Without a doubt these signatures were all
forgeries&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down! sit down!&nbsp; Shut up!&nbsp; You are confessing.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll find your names in the lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Chairman, how many of those envelopes have you got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chair counted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Together with those that have been already examined, there
are nineteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A storm of derisive applause broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they all contain the secret.&nbsp; I move that you
open them all and read every signature that is attached to a note of
that sort&mdash;and read also the first eight words of the note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second the motion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was put and carried&mdash;uproariously.&nbsp; Then poor old Richards
got up, and his wife rose and stood at his side.&nbsp; Her head was
bent down, so that none might see that she was crying.&nbsp; Her husband
gave her his arm, and so supporting her, he began to speak in a quavering
voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends, you have known us two&mdash;Mary and me&mdash;all
our lives, and I think you have liked us and respected us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chair interrupted him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me.&nbsp; It is quite true&mdash;that which you are
saying, Mr. Richards; this town <i>does</i> know you two; it <i>does</i>
like you; it <i>does</i> respect you; more&mdash;it honours you and
<i>loves</i> you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Halliday&rsquo;s voice rang out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the hall-marked truth, too!&nbsp; If the Chair
is right, let the house speak up and say it.&nbsp; Rise!&nbsp; Now,
then&mdash;hip! hip! hip!&mdash;all together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house rose in mass, faced toward the old couple eagerly, filled
the air with a snow-storm of waving handkerchiefs, and delivered the
cheers with all its affectionate heart.</p>
<p>The Chair then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I was going to say is this: We know your good heart,
Mr. Richards, but this is not a time for the exercise of charity toward
offenders.&nbsp; [Shouts of &ldquo;Right! right!&rdquo;]&nbsp; I see
your generous purpose in your face, but I cannot allow you to plead
for these men&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was going to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please take your seat, Mr. Richards.&nbsp; We must examine
the rest of these notes&mdash;simple fairness to the men who have already
been exposed requires this.&nbsp; As soon as that has been done&mdash;I
give you my word for this&mdash;you shall he heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;Right!&mdash;the Chair is right&mdash;no
interruption can be permitted at this stage!&nbsp; Go on!&mdash;the
names! the names!&mdash;according to the terms of the motion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old couple sat reluctantly down, and the husband whispered to
the wife, &ldquo;It is pitifully hard to have to wait; the shame will
be greater than ever when they find we were only going to plead for
<i>ourselves</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straightway the jollity broke loose again with the reading of the
names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are far from being a bad man&mdash;&rsquo; Signature,
&lsquo;Robert J. Titmarsh.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You are far from being a bad man&mdash;&rsquo; Signature,
&lsquo;Eliphalet Weeks.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are far from being a bad man&mdash;&rsquo; Signature,
&lsquo;Oscar B. Wilder.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point the house lit upon the idea of taking the eight words
out of the Chairman&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; He was not unthankful for that.&nbsp;
Thenceforward he held up each note in its turn and waited.&nbsp; The
house droned out the eight words in a massed and measured and musical
deep volume of sound (with a daringly close resemblance to a well-known
church chant)&mdash;&ldquo;You are f-a-r from being a b-a-a-a-d man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then the Chair said, &ldquo;Signature, &lsquo;Archibald Wilcox.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
And so on, and so on, name after name, and everybody had an increasingly
and gloriously good time except the wretched Nineteen.&nbsp; Now and
then, when a particularly shining name was called, the house made the
Chair wait while it chanted the whole of the test-remark from the beginning
to the closing words, &ldquo;And go to hell or Hadleyburg&mdash;try
and make it the for-or-m-e-r!&rdquo; and in these special cases they
added a grand and agonised and imposing &ldquo;A-a-a-a-<i>men</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The list dwindled, dwindled, dwindled, poor old Richards keeping
tally of the count, wincing when a name resembling his own was pronounced,
and waiting in miserable suspense for the time to come when it would
be his humiliating privilege to rise with Mary and finish his plea,
which he was intending to word thus: &ldquo;. . . for until now we have
never done any wrong thing, but have gone our humble way unreproached.&nbsp;
We are very poor, we are old, and, have no chick nor child to help us;
we were sorely tempted, and we fell.&nbsp; It was my purpose when I
got up before to make confession and beg that my name might not be read
out in this public place, for it seemed to us that we could not bear
it; but I was prevented.&nbsp; It was just; it was our place to suffer
with the rest.&nbsp; It has been hard for us.&nbsp; It is the first
time we have ever heard our name fall from any one&rsquo;s lips&mdash;sullied.&nbsp;
Be merciful&mdash;for the sake or the better days; make our shame as
light to bear as in your charity you can.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this point
in his reverie Mary nudged him, perceiving that his mind was absent.&nbsp;
The house was chanting, &ldquo;You are f-a-r,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be ready,&rdquo; Mary whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your name comes
now; he has read eighteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chant ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next! next! next!&rdquo; came volleying from all over the
house.</p>
<p>Burgess put his hand into his pocket.&nbsp; The old couple, trembling,
began to rise.&nbsp; Burgess fumbled a moment, then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find I have read them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faint with joy and surprise, the couple sank into their seats, and
Mary whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bless God, we are saved!&mdash;he has lost ours&mdash;I
wouldn&rsquo;t give this for a hundred of those sacks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The house burst out with its &ldquo;Mikado&rdquo; travesty, and sang
it three times with ever-increasing enthusiasm, rising to its feet when
it reached for the third time the closing line&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But the Symbols are here, you bet!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and finishing up with cheers and a tiger for &ldquo;Hadleyburg purity
and our eighteen immortal representatives of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Wingate, the saddler, got up and proposed cheers &ldquo;for
the cleanest man in town, the one solitary important citizen in it who
didn&rsquo;t try to steal that money&mdash;Edward Richards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were given with great and moving heartiness; then somebody proposed
that &ldquo;Richards be elected sole Guardian and Symbol of the now
Sacred Hadleyburg Tradition, with power and right to stand up and look
the whole sarcastic world in the face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passed, by acclamation; then they sang the &ldquo;Mikado&rdquo; again,
and ended it with&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s <i>one</i> Symbol left, you
bet!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a pause; then&mdash;</p>
<p>A Voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, then, who&rsquo;s to get the sack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tanner (with bitter sarcasm).&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy.&nbsp;
The money has to be divided among the eighteen Incorruptibles.&nbsp;
They gave the suffering stranger twenty dollars apiece&mdash;and that
remark&mdash;each in his turn&mdash;it took twenty-two minutes for the
procession to move past.&nbsp; Staked the stranger&mdash;total contribution,
$360.&nbsp; All they want is just the loan back&mdash;and interest&mdash;forty
thousand dollars altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many Voices [derisively.]&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&nbsp; Divvy!
divvy!&nbsp; Be kind to the poor&mdash;don&rsquo;t keep them waiting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Order!&nbsp; I now offer the stranger&rsquo;s
remaining document.&nbsp; It says: &lsquo;If no claimant shall appear
[grand chorus of groans], I desire that you open the sack and count
out the money to the principal citizens of your town, they to take it
in trust [Cries of &ldquo;Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo;], and use it in such ways
as to them shall seem best for the propagation and preservation of your
community&rsquo;s noble reputation for incorruptible honesty [more cries]&mdash;a
reputation to which their names and their efforts will add a new and
far-reaching lustre.&rdquo;&nbsp; [Enthusiastic outburst of sarcastic
applause.]&nbsp; That seems to be all.&nbsp; No&mdash;here is a postscript:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;P.S.&mdash;CITIZENS OF HADLEYBURG: There <i>is</i>
no test-remark&mdash;nobody made one.&nbsp; [Great sensation.]&nbsp;
There wasn&rsquo;t any pauper stranger, nor any twenty-dollar contribution,
nor any accompanying benediction and compliment&mdash;these are all
inventions.&nbsp; [General buzz and hum of astonishment and delight.]&nbsp;
Allow me to tell my story&mdash;it will take but a word or two.&nbsp;
I passed through your town at a certain time, and received a deep offence
which I had not earned.&nbsp; Any other man would have been content
to kill one or two of you and call it square, but to me that would have
been a trivial revenge, and inadequate; for the dead do not <i>suffer</i>.
Besides I could not kill you all&mdash;and, anyway, made as I am, even
that would not have satisfied me.&nbsp; I wanted to damage every man
in the place, and every woman&mdash;and not in their bodies or in their
estate, but in their vanity&mdash;the place where feeble and foolish
people are most vulnerable.&nbsp; So I disguised myself and came back
and studied you.&nbsp; You were easy game.&nbsp; You had an old and
lofty reputation for honesty, and naturally you were proud of it&mdash;it
was your treasure of treasures, the very apple of your eye.&nbsp; As
soon as I found out that you carefully and vigilantly kept yourselves
and your children <i>out of temptation</i>, I knew how to proceed.&nbsp;
Why, you simple creatures, the weakest of all weak things is a virtue
which has not been tested in the fire.&nbsp; I laid a plan, and gathered
a list of names.&nbsp; My project was to corrupt Hadleyburg the Incorruptible.&nbsp;
My idea was to make liars and thieves of nearly half a hundred smirchless
men and women who had never in their lives uttered a lie or stolen a
penny.&nbsp; I was afraid of Goodson.&nbsp; He was neither born nor
reared in Hadleyburg.&nbsp; I was afraid that if I started to operate
my scheme by getting my letter laid before you, you would say to yourselves,
&lsquo;Goodson is the only man among us who would give away twenty dollars
to a poor devil&rsquo;&mdash;and then you might not bite at my bait.&nbsp;
But heaven took Goodson; then I knew I was safe, and I set my trap and
baited it.&nbsp; It may be that I shall not catch all the men to whom
I mailed the pretended test-secret, but I shall catch the most of them,
if I know Hadleyburg nature.&nbsp; [Voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;Right&mdash;he
got every last one of them.&rdquo;]&nbsp; I believe they will even steal
ostensible <i>gamble</i>-money, rather than miss, poor, tempted, and
mistrained fellows.&nbsp; I am hoping to eternally and everlastingly
squelch your vanity and give Hadleyburg a new renown&mdash;one that
will <i>stick</i>&mdash;and spread far.&nbsp; If I have succeeded, open
the sack and summon the Committee on Propagation and Preservation of
the Hadleyburg Reputation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Cyclone of Voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;Open it!&nbsp; Open it!&nbsp; The
Eighteen to the front!&nbsp; Committee on Propagation of the Tradition!&nbsp;
Forward&mdash;the Incorruptibles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chair ripped the sack wide, and gathered up a handful of bright,
broad, yellow coins, shook them together, then examined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends, they are only gilded disks of lead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a crashing outbreak of delight over this news, and when
the noise had subsided, the tanner called out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By right of apparent seniority in this business, Mr. Wilson
is Chairman of the Committee on Propagation of the Tradition.&nbsp;
I suggest that he step forward on behalf of his pals, and receive in
trust the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Hundred Voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wilson!&nbsp; Wilson!&nbsp; Wilson!&nbsp;
Speech!&nbsp; Speech!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilson [in a voice trembling with anger].&nbsp; &ldquo;You will allow
me to say, and without apologies for my language, <i>damn</i> the money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, and him a Baptist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seventeen Symbols left!&nbsp; Step up, gentlemen,
and assume your trust!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause&mdash;no response.</p>
<p>The Saddler.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Chairman, we&rsquo;ve got <i>one</i>
clean man left, anyway, out of the late aristocracy; and he needs money,
and deserves it.&nbsp; I move that you appoint Jack Halliday to get
up there and auction off that sack of gilt twenty-dollar pieces, and
give the result to the right man&mdash;the man whom Hadleyburg delights
to honour&mdash;Edward Richards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was received with great enthusiasm, the dog taking a hand again;
the saddler started the bids at a dollar, the Brixton folk and Barnum&rsquo;s
representative fought hard for it, the people cheered every jump that
the bids made, the excitement climbed moment by moment higher and higher,
the bidders got on their mettle and grew steadily more and more daring,
more and more determined, the jumps went from a dollar up to five, then
to ten, then to twenty, then fifty, then to a hundred, then&mdash;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the auction Richards whispered in distress to
his wife: &ldquo;Oh, Mary, can we allow it?&nbsp; It&mdash;it&mdash;you
see, it is an honour&mdash;reward, a testimonial to purity of character,
and&mdash;and&mdash;can we allow it?&nbsp; Hadn&rsquo;t I better get
up and&mdash;Oh, Mary, what ought we to do?&mdash;what do you think
we&mdash;&rdquo; [Halliday&rsquo;s voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fifteen I&rsquo;m
bid!&mdash;fifteen for the sack!&mdash;twenty!&mdash;ah, thanks!&mdash;thirty&mdash;thanks
again!&nbsp; Thirty, thirty, thirty!&mdash;do I hear forty?&mdash;forty
it is!&nbsp; Keep the ball rolling, gentlemen, keep it rolling!&mdash;fifty!&mdash;thanks,
noble Roman!&mdash;going at fifty, fifty, fifty!&mdash;seventy!&mdash;ninety!&mdash;splendid!&mdash;a
hundred!&mdash;pile it up, pile it up!&mdash;hundred and twenty&mdash;forty!&mdash;just
in time!&mdash;hundred and fifty!&mdash;Two hundred!&mdash;superb!&nbsp;
Do I hear two h&mdash;thanks!&mdash;two hundred and fifty!&mdash;&rdquo;]</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is another temptation, Edward&mdash;I&rsquo;m all in a
tremble&mdash;but, oh, we&rsquo;ve escaped one temptation, and that
ought to warn us, to&mdash;[&ldquo;Six did I hear?&mdash;thanks!&mdash;six
fifty, six f&mdash;SEVEN hundred!&rdquo;]&nbsp; And yet, Edward, when
you think&mdash;nobody susp&mdash;[&ldquo;Eight hundred dollars!&mdash;hurrah!&mdash;make
it nine!&mdash;Mr. Parsons, did I hear you say&mdash;thanks!&mdash;nine!&mdash;this
noble sack of virgin lead going at only nine hundred dollars, gilding
and all&mdash;come! do I hear&mdash;a thousand!&mdash;gratefully yours!&mdash;did
some one say eleven?&mdash;a sack which is going to be the most celebrated
in the whole Uni&mdash;&rdquo;]&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Edward&rdquo; (beginning
to sob), &ldquo;we are so poor!&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;do as you
think best&mdash;do as you think best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward fell&mdash;that is, he sat still; sat with a conscience which
was not satisfied, but which was overpowered by circumstances.</p>
<p>Meantime a stranger, who looked like an amateur detective gotten
up as an impossible English earl, had been watching the evening&rsquo;s
proceedings with manifest interest, and with a contented expression
in his face; and he had been privately commenting to himself.&nbsp;
He was now soliloquising somewhat like this: &ldquo;None of the Eighteen
are bidding; that is not satisfactory; I must change that&mdash;the
dramatic unities require it; they must buy the sack they tried to steal;
they must pay a heavy price, too&mdash;some of them are rich.&nbsp;
And another thing, when I make a mistake in Hadleyburg nature the man
that puts that error upon me is entitled to a high honorarium, and some
one must pay.&nbsp; This poor old Richards has brought my judgment to
shame; he is an honest man:&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand it, but I
acknowledge it.&nbsp; Yes, he saw my deuces&mdash;<i>and</i> with a
straight flush, and by rights the pot is his.&nbsp; And it shall be
a jack-pot, too, if I can manage it.&nbsp; He disappointed me, but let
that pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was watching the bidding.&nbsp; At a thousand, the market broke:
the prices tumbled swiftly.&nbsp; He waited&mdash;and still watched.&nbsp;
One competitor dropped out; then another, and another.&nbsp; He put
in a bid or two now.&nbsp; When the bids had sunk to ten dollars, he
added a five; some one raised him a three; he waited a moment, then
flung in a fifty-dollar jump, and the sack was his&mdash;at $1,282.&nbsp;
The house broke out in cheers&mdash;then stopped; for he was on his
feet, and had lifted his hand.&nbsp; He began to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire to say a word, and ask a favour.&nbsp; I am a speculator
in rarities, and I have dealings with persons interested in numismatics
all over the world.&nbsp; I can make a profit on this purchase, just
as it stands; but there is a way, if I can get your approval, whereby
I can make every one of these leaden twenty-dollar pieces worth its
face in gold, and perhaps more.&nbsp; Grant me that approval, and I
will give part of my gains to your Mr. Richards, whose invulnerable
probity you have so justly and so cordially recognised to-night; his
share shall be ten thousand dollars, and I will hand him the money to-morrow.&nbsp;
[Great applause from the house.&nbsp; But the &ldquo;invulnerable probity&rdquo;
made the Richardses blush prettily; however, it went for modesty, and
did no harm.]&nbsp; If you will pass my proposition by a good majority&mdash;I
would like a two-thirds vote&mdash;I will regard that as the town&rsquo;s
consent, and that is all I ask.&nbsp; Rarities are always helped by
any device which will rouse curiosity and compel remark.&nbsp; Now if
I may have your permission to stamp upon the faces of each of these
ostensible coins the names of the eighteen gentlemen who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nine-tenths of the audience were on their feet in a moment&mdash;dog
and all&mdash;and the proposition was carried with a whirlwind of approving
applause and laughter.</p>
<p>They sat down, and all the Symbols except &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; Clay
Harkness got up, violently protesting against the proposed outrage,
and threatening to&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg you not to threaten me,&rdquo; said the stranger calmly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know my legal rights, and am not accustomed to being frightened
at bluster.&rdquo;&nbsp; [Applause.]&nbsp; He sat down.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo;
Harkness saw an opportunity here.&nbsp; He was one of the two very rich
men of the place, and Pinkerton was the other.&nbsp; Harkness was proprietor
of a mint; that is to say, a popular patent medicine.&nbsp; He was running
for the Legislature on one ticket, and Pinkerton on the other.&nbsp;
It was a close race and a hot one, and getting hotter every day.&nbsp;
Both had strong appetites for money; each had bought a great tract of
land, with a purpose; there was going to be a new railway, and each
wanted to be in the Legislature and help locate the route to his own
advantage; a single vote might make the decision, and with it two or
three fortunes.&nbsp; The stake was large, and Harkness was a daring
speculator.&nbsp; He was sitting close to the stranger.&nbsp; He leaned
over while one or another of the other Symbols was entertaining the
house with protests and appeals, and asked, in a whisper,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your price for the sack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty thousand dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The price is forty thousand dollars; not a penny less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll give it.&nbsp; I will come to the hotel
at ten in the morning.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want it known; will see you
privately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the stranger got up and said
to the house:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find it late.&nbsp; The speeches of these gentlemen are
not without merit, not without interest, not without grace; yet if I
may he excused I will take my leave.&nbsp; I thank you for the great
favour which you have shown me in granting my petition.&nbsp; I ask
the Chair to keep the sack for me until to-morrow, and to hand these
three five-hundred-dollar notes to Mr. Richards.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were
passed up to the Chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At nine I will call for the sack, and at eleven will deliver
the rest of the ten thousand to Mr. Richards in person at his home.&nbsp;
Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he slipped out, and left the audience making a vast noise, which
was composed of a mixture of cheers, the &ldquo;Mikado&rdquo; song,
dog-disapproval, and the chant, &ldquo;You are f-a-r from being a b-a-a-d
man&mdash;a-a-a a-men!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>IV.</h2>
<p>At home the Richardses had to endure congratulations and compliments
until midnight.&nbsp; Then they were left to themselves.&nbsp; They
looked a little sad, and they sat silent and thinking.&nbsp; Finally
Mary sighed and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we are to blame, Edward&mdash;<i>much</i> to
blame?&rdquo; and her eyes wandered to the accusing triplet of big bank-notes
lying on the table, where the congratulators had been gloating over
them and reverently fingering them.&nbsp; Edward did not answer at once;
then he brought out a sigh and said, hesitatingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t help it, Mary.&nbsp; It&mdash;well
it was ordered.&nbsp; <i>All</i> things are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary glanced up and looked at him steadily, but he didn&rsquo;t return
the look.&nbsp; Presently she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought congratulations and praises always tasted good.&nbsp;
But&mdash;it seems to me, now&mdash;Edward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to stay in the bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning&mdash;by note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Richards bowed his head in his hands and muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before I was not afraid to let oceans of people&rsquo;s money
pour through my hands, but&mdash;Mary, I am so tired, so tired&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will go to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At nine in the morning the stranger called for the sack and took
it to the hotel in a cab.&nbsp; At ten Harkness had a talk with him
privately.&nbsp; The stranger asked for and got five cheques on a metropolitan
bank&mdash;drawn to &ldquo;Bearer,&rdquo;&mdash;four for $1,500 each,
and one for $34,000.&nbsp; He put one of the former in his pocket-book,
and the remainder, representing $38,500, he put in an envelope, and
with these he added a note which he wrote after Harkness was gone.&nbsp;
At eleven he called at the Richards&rsquo; house and knocked.&nbsp;
Mrs. Richards peeped through the shutters, then went and received the
envelope, and the stranger disappeared without a word.&nbsp; She came
back flushed and a little unsteady on her legs, and gasped out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I recognised him!&nbsp; Last night it seemed to
me that maybe I had seen him somewhere before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the man that brought the sack here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am almost sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is the ostensible Stephenson too, and sold every important
citizen in this town with his bogus secret.&nbsp; Now if he has sent
cheques instead of money, we are sold too, after we thought we had escaped.&nbsp;
I was beginning to feel fairly comfortable once more, after my night&rsquo;s
rest, but the look of that envelope makes me sick.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t
fat enough; $8,500 in even the largest bank-notes makes more bulk than
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward, why do you object to cheques?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheques signed by Stephenson!&nbsp; I am resigned to take
the $8,500 if it could come in bank-notes&mdash;for it does seem that
it was so ordered, Mary&mdash;but I have never had much courage, and
I have not the pluck to try to market a cheque signed with that disastrous
name.&nbsp; It would be a trap.&nbsp; That man tried to catch me; we
escaped somehow or other; and now he is trying a new way.&nbsp; If it
is cheques&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Edward, it is <i>too</i> bad!&rdquo;&nbsp; And she held
up the cheques and began to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put them in the fire! quick! we mustn&rsquo;t be tempted.&nbsp;
It is a trick to make the world laugh at <i>us</i>, along with the rest,
and&mdash;Give them to <i>me</i>, since you can&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He snatched them and tried to hold his grip till he could get to the
stove; but he was human, he was a cashier, and he stopped a moment to
make sure of the signature.&nbsp; Then he came near to fainting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fan me, Mary, fan me!&nbsp; They are the same as gold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely, Edward!&nbsp; Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signed by Harkness.&nbsp; What can the mystery of that be,
Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward, do you think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here&mdash;look at this!&nbsp; Fifteen&mdash;fifteen&mdash;fifteen&mdash;thirty-four.&nbsp;
Thirty-eight thousand five hundred!&nbsp; Mary, the sack isn&rsquo;t
worth twelve dollars, and Harkness&mdash;apparently&mdash;has paid about
par for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does it all come to us, do you think&mdash;instead of
the ten thousand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it looks like it.&nbsp; And the cheques are made to &lsquo;Bearer,&rsquo;
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that good, Edward?&nbsp; What is it for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hint to collect them at some distant bank, I reckon.&nbsp;
Perhaps Harkness doesn&rsquo;t want the matter known.&nbsp; What is
that&mdash;a note?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; It was with the cheques.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in the &ldquo;Stephenson&rdquo; handwriting, but there was
no signature.&nbsp; It said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am a disappointed man.&nbsp; Your honesty is
beyond the reach of temptation.&nbsp; I had a different idea about it,
but I wronged you in that, and I beg pardon, and do it sincerely.&nbsp;
I honour you&mdash;and that is sincere too.&nbsp; This town is not worthy
to kiss the hem of your garment.&nbsp; Dear sir, I made a square bet
with myself that there were nineteen debauchable men in your self-righteous
community.&nbsp; I have lost.&nbsp; Take the whole pot, you are entitled
to it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richards drew a deep sigh, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems written with fire&mdash;it burns so.&nbsp; Mary&mdash;I
am miserable again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, too.&nbsp; Ah, dear, I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think, Mary&mdash;he <i>believes</i> in me.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, Edward&mdash;I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If those beautiful words were deserved, Mary&mdash;and God
knows I believed I deserved them once&mdash;I think I could give the
forty thousand dollars for them.&nbsp; And I would put that paper away,
as representing more than gold and jewels, and keep it always.&nbsp;
But now&mdash;We could not live in the shadow of its accusing presence,
Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put it in the fire.</p>
<p>A messenger arrived and delivered an envelope.&nbsp; Richards took
from it a note and read it; it was from Burgess:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You saved me, in a difficult time.&nbsp; I saved
you last night.&nbsp; It was at cost of a lie, but I made the sacrifice
freely, and out of a grateful heart.&nbsp; None in this village knows
so well as I know how brave and good and noble you are.&nbsp; At bottom
you cannot respect me, knowing as you do of that matter of which I am
accused, and by the general voice condemned; but I beg that you will
at least believe that I am a grateful man; it will help me to bear my
burden.&nbsp; [Signed]&nbsp; &lsquo;BURGESS.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Saved, once more.&nbsp; And on such terms!&rdquo;&nbsp; He
put the note in the lire.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;I wish I were dead, Mary,
I wish I were out of it all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, these are bitter, bitter days, Edward.&nbsp; The stabs,
through their very generosity, are so deep&mdash;and they come so fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three days before the election each of two thousand voters suddenly
found himself in possession of a prized memento&mdash;one of the renowned
bogus double-eagles.&nbsp; Around one of its faces was stamped these
words: &ldquo;THE REMARK I MADE TO THE POOR STRANGER WAS&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
Around the other face was stamped these: &ldquo;GO, AND REFORM.&nbsp;
[SIGNED] PINKERTON.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the entire remaining refuse of
the renowned joke was emptied upon a single head, and with calamitous
effect.&nbsp; It revived the recent vast laugh and concentrated it upon
Pinkerton; and Harkness&rsquo;s election was a walk-over.</p>
<p>Within twenty-four hours after the Richardses had received their
cheques their consciences were quieting down, discouraged; the old couple
were learning to reconcile themselves to the sin which they had committed.&nbsp;
But they were to learn, now, that a sin takes on new and real terrors
when there seems a chance that it is going to be found out.&nbsp; This
gives it a fresh and most substantial and important aspect.&nbsp; At
church the morning sermon was of the usual pattern; it was the same
old things said in the same old way; they had heard them a thousand
times and found them innocuous, next to meaningless, and easy to sleep
under; but now it was different: the sermon seemed to bristle with accusations;
it seemed aimed straight and specially at people who were concealing
deadly sins.&nbsp; After church they got away from the mob of congratulators
as soon as they could, and hurried homeward, chilled to the bone at
they did not know what&mdash;vague, shadowy, indefinite fears.&nbsp;
And by chance they caught a glimpse of Mr. Burgess as he turned a corner.&nbsp;
He paid no attention to their nod of recognition!&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t
seen it; but they did not know that.&nbsp; What could his conduct mean?&nbsp;
It might mean&mdash;it might&mdash;mean&mdash;oh, a dozen dreadful things.&nbsp;
Was it possible that he knew that Richards could have cleared him of
guilt in that bygone time, and had been silently waiting for a chance
to even up accounts?&nbsp; At home, in their distress they got to imagining
that their servant might have been in the next room listening when Richards
revealed the secret to his wife that he knew of Burgess&rsquo;s innocence;
next Richards began to imagine that he had heard the swish of a gown
in there at that time; next, he was sure he <i>had</i> heard it.&nbsp;
They would call Sarah in, on a pretext, and watch her face; if she had
been betraying them to Mr. Burgess, it would show in her manner.&nbsp;
They asked her some questions&mdash;questions which were so random and
incoherent and seemingly purposeless that the girl felt sure that the
old people&rsquo;s minds had been affected by their sudden good fortune;
the sharp and watchful gaze which they bent upon her frightened her,
and that completed the business.&nbsp; She blushed, she became nervous
and confused, and to the old people these were plain signs of guilt&mdash;guilt
of some fearful sort or other&mdash;without doubt she was a spy and
a traitor.&nbsp; When they were alone again they began to piece many
unrelated things together and get horrible results out of the combination.&nbsp;
When things had got about to the worst Richards was delivered of a sudden
gasp and his wife asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what is it?&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The note&mdash;Burgess&rsquo;s note!&nbsp; Its language was
sarcastic, I see it now.&rdquo;&nbsp; He quoted: &ldquo;&lsquo;At bottom
you cannot respect me, <i>knowing</i>, as you do, of <i>that matter
of</i> which I am accused&rsquo;&mdash;oh, it is perfectly plain, now,
God help me!&nbsp; He knows that I know!&nbsp; You see the ingenuity
of the phrasing.&nbsp; It was a trap&mdash;and like a fool, I walked
into it.&nbsp; And Mary&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is dreadful&mdash;I know what you are going to say&mdash;he
didn&rsquo;t return your transcript of the pretended test-remark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;kept it to destroy us with.&nbsp; Mary, he has exposed
us to some already.&nbsp; I know it&mdash;I know it well.&nbsp; I saw
it in a dozen faces after church.&nbsp; Ah, he wouldn&rsquo;t answer
our nod of recognition&mdash;he knew what he had been doing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the night the doctor was called.&nbsp; The news went around in
the morning that the old couple were rather seriously ill&mdash;prostrated
by the exhausting excitement growing out of their great windfall, the
congratulations, and the late hours, the doctor said.&nbsp; The town
was sincerely distressed; for these old people were about all it had
left to be proud of, now.</p>
<p>Two days later the news was worse.&nbsp; The old couple were delirious,
and were doing strange things.&nbsp; By witness of the nurses, Richards
had exhibited cheques&mdash;for $8,500?&nbsp; No&mdash;for an amazing
sum&mdash;$38,500!&nbsp; What could be the explanation of this gigantic
piece of luck?</p>
<p>The following day the nurses had more news&mdash;and wonderful.&nbsp;
They had concluded to hide the cheques, lest harm come to them; but
when they searched they were gone from under the patient&rsquo;s pillow&mdash;vanished
away.&nbsp; The patient said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the pillow alone; what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought it best that the cheques&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will never see them again&mdash;they are destroyed.&nbsp;
They came from Satan.&nbsp; I saw the hell-brand on them, and I knew
they were sent to betray me to sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he fell to gabbling
strange and dreadful things which were not clearly understandable, and
which the doctor admonished them to keep to themselves.</p>
<p>Richards was right; the cheques were never seen again.</p>
<p>A nurse must have talked in her sleep, for within two days the forbidden
gabblings were the property of the town; and they were of a surprising
sort.&nbsp; They seemed to indicate that Richards had been a claimant
for the sack himself, and that Burgess had concealed that fact and then
maliciously betrayed it.</p>
<p>Burgess was taxed with this and stoutly denied it.&nbsp; And he said
it was not fair to attach weight to the chatter of a sick old man who
was out of his mind.&nbsp; Still, suspicion was in the air, and there
was much talk.</p>
<p>After a day or two it was reported that Mrs. Richards&rsquo;s delirious
deliveries were getting to be duplicates of her husband&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Suspicion flamed up into conviction, now, and the town&rsquo;s pride
in the purity of its one undiscredited important citizen began to dim
down and flicker toward extinction.</p>
<p>Six days passed, then came more news.&nbsp; The old couple were dying.&nbsp;
Richards&rsquo;s mind cleared in his latest hour, and he sent for Burgess.&nbsp;
Burgess said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the room be cleared.&nbsp; I think he wishes to say something
in privacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Richards; &ldquo;I want witnesses.&nbsp; I
want you all to hear my confession, so that I may die a man, and not
a dog.&nbsp; I was clean&mdash;artificially&mdash;like the rest; and
like the rest I fell when temptation came.&nbsp; I signed a lie, and
claimed the miserable sack.&nbsp; Mr. Burgess remembered that I had
done him a service, and in gratitude (and ignorance) he suppressed my
claim and saved me.&nbsp; You know the thing that was charged against
Burgess years ago.&nbsp; My testimony, and mine alone, could have cleared
him, and I was a coward and left him to suffer disgrace&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;Mr. Richards, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My servant betrayed my secret to him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one has betrayed anything to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;&ldquo;And then he did a natural and justifiable thing; he
repented of the saving kindness which he had done me, and he <i>exposed</i>
me&mdash;as I deserved&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&mdash;I make oath&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of my heart I forgive him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burgess&rsquo;s impassioned protestations fell upon deaf ears; the
dying man passed away without knowing that once more he had done poor
Burgess a wrong.&nbsp; The old wife died that night.</p>
<p>The last of the sacred Nineteen had fallen a prey to the fiendish
sack; the town was stripped of the last rag of its ancient glory.&nbsp;
Its mourning was not showy, but it was deep.</p>
<p>By act of the Legislature&mdash;upon prayer and petition&mdash;Hadleyburg
was allowed to change its name to (never mind what&mdash;I will not
give it away), and leave one word out of the motto that for many generations
had graced the town&rsquo;s official seal.</p>
<p>It is an honest town once more, and the man will have to rise early
that catches it napping again.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
