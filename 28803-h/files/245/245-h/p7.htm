<h3>A Thumb-print and What Came of It</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>WE were approaching Napoleon, Arkansas. So I began to think
about my errand there. Time, noonday; and bright and sunny. This
was bad&mdash;not best, anyway; for mine was not (preferably) a
noonday kind of errand. The more I thought, the more that fact
pushed itself upon me&mdash;now in one form, now in another. Finally,
it took the form of a distinct question: is it good common sense
to do the errand in daytime, when, by a little sacrifice of
comfort and inclination, you can have night for it, and no
inquisitive eyes around. This settled it. Plain question and
plain answer make the shortest road out of most perplexities.</p>

<p>I got my friends into my stateroom, and said I was sorry to
create annoyance and disappointment, but that upon reflection it
really seemed best that we put our luggage ashore and stop over
at Napoleon. Their disapproval was prompt and loud; their
language mutinous. Their main argument was one which has always
been the first to come to the surface, in such cases, since the
beginning of time: 'But you decided and AGREED to stick to this
boat, etc.; as if, having determined to do an unwise thing, one
is thereby bound to go ahead and make TWO unwise things of it, by
carrying out that determination.</p>

<p>I tried various mollifying tactics upon them, with reasonably
good success: under which encouragement, I increased my efforts;
and, to show them that I had not created this annoying errand,
and was in no way to blame for it, I presently drifted into its
history&mdash;substantially as follows:</p>

<p>Toward the end of last year, I spent a few months in Munich,
Bavaria. In November I was living in Fraulein Dahlweiner's
PENSION, 1a, Karlstrasse; but my working quarters were a mile
from there, in the house of a widow who supported herself by
taking lodgers. She and her two young children used to drop in
every morning and talk German to me&mdash;by request. One day, during
a ramble about the city, I visited one of the two establishments
where the Government keeps and watches corpses until the doctors
decide that they are permanently dead, and not in a trance state.
It was a grisly place, that spacious room. There were thirty-six
corpses of adults in sight, stretched on their backs on slightly
slanted boards, in three long rows&mdash;all of them with wax-white,
rigid faces, and all of them wrapped in white shrouds. Along the
sides of the room were deep alcoves, like bay windows; and in
each of these lay several marble-visaged babes, utterly hidden
and buried under banks of fresh flowers, all but their faces and
crossed hands. Around a finger of each of these fifty still
forms, both great and small, was a ring; and from the ring a wire
led to the ceiling, and thence to a bell in a watch-room yonder,
where, day and night, a watchman sits always alert and ready to
spring to the aid of any of that pallid company who, waking out
of death, shall make a movement&mdash;for any, even the slightest,
movement will twitch the wire and ring that fearful bell. I
imagined myself a death-sentinel drowsing there alone, far in the
dragging watches of some wailing, gusty night, and having in a
twinkling all my body stricken to quivering jelly by the sudden
clamor of that awful summons! So I inquired about this thing;
asked what resulted usually? if the watchman died, and the
restored corpse came and did what it could to make his last
moments easy. But I was rebuked for trying to feed an idle and
frivolous curiosity in so solemn and so mournful a place; and
went my way with a humbled crest.</p>

<p>Next morning I was telling the widow my adventure, when she
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'Come with me! I have a lodger who shall tell you all you want
to know. He has been a night-watchman there.'</p>

<p>He was a living man, but he did not look it. He was abed, and
had his head propped high on pillows; his face was wasted and
colorless, his deep-sunken eyes were shut; his hand, lying on his
breast, was talon-like, it was so bony and long-fingered. The
widow began her introduction of me. The man's eyes opened slowly,
and glittered wickedly out from the twilight of their caverns; he
frowned a black frown; he lifted his lean hand and waved us
peremptorily away. But the widow kept straight on, till she had
got out the fact that I was a stranger and an American. The man's
face changed at once; brightened, became even eager&mdash;and the next
moment he and I were alone together.</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>I opened up in cast-iron German; he responded in quite
flexible English; thereafter we gave the German language a
permanent rest.</p>

<p>This consumptive and I became good friends. I visited him
every day, and we talked about everything. At least, about
everything but wives and children. Let anybody's wife or
anybody's child be mentioned, and three things always followed:
the most gracious and loving and tender light glimmered in the
man's eyes for a moment; faded out the next, and in its place
came that deadly look which had flamed there the first time I
ever saw his lids unclose; thirdly, he ceased from speech, there
and then for that day; lay silent, abstracted, and absorbed;
apparently heard nothing that I said; took no notice of my
good-byes, and plainly did not know, by either sight or hearing,
when I left the room.</p>

<p>When I had been this Karl Ritter's daily and sole intimate
during two months, he one day said, abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>'I will tell you my story.'</p>

<p>A DYING MAN S CONFESSION</p>

<p>Then he went on as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>I have never given up, until now. But now I have given up. I
am going to die. I made up my mind last night that it must be,
and very soon, too. You say you are going to revisit your river,
by-and-bye, when you find opportunity. Very well; that, together
with a certain strange experience which fell to my lot last
night, determines me to tell you my history&mdash;for you will see
Napoleon, Arkansas; and for my sake you will stop there, and do a
certain thing for me&mdash;a thing which you will willingly undertake
after you shall have heard my narrative.</p>

<p>Let us shorten the story wherever we can, for it will need it,
being long. You already know how I came to go to America, and how
I came to settle in that lonely region in the South. But you do
not know that I had a wife. My wife was young, beautiful, loving,
and oh, so divinely good and blameless and gentle! And our little
girl was her mother in miniature. It was the happiest of happy
households.</p>

<p>One night&mdash;it was toward the close of the war&mdash;I woke up out
of a sodden lethargy, and found myself bound and gagged, and the
air tainted with chloroform! I saw two men in the room, and one
was saying to the other, in a hoarse whisper, 'I told her I
would, if she made a noise, and as for the child&mdash;'</p>

<p>The other man interrupted in a low, half-crying voice&mdash;</p>

<p>'You said we'd only gag them and rob them, not hurt them; or I
wouldn't have come.'</p>

<p>'Shut up your whining; had to change the plan when they waked
up; you done all you could to protect them, now let that satisfy
you; come, help rummage.'</p>

<a name="342"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="342.jpg (96K)" src="images/342.jpg" height="547" width="597">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Both men were masked, and wore coarse, ragged 'nigger'
clothes; they had a bull's-eye lantern, and by its light I
noticed that the gentler robber had no thumb on his right hand.
They rummaged around my poor cabin for a moment; the head bandit
then said, in his stage whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>'It's a waste of time&mdash;he shall tell where it's hid. Undo his
gag, and revive him up.'</p>

<p>The other said&mdash;</p>

<p>'All right&mdash;provided no clubbing.'</p>

<p>'No clubbing it is, then&mdash;provided he keeps still.'</p>

<p>They approached me; just then there was a sound outside; a
sound of voices and trampling hoofs; the robbers held their
breath and listened; the sounds came slowly nearer and nearer;
then came a shout&mdash;</p>

<p>'HELLO, the house! Show a light, we want water.'</p>

<p>'The captain's voice, by G&mdash;!' said the stage-whispering
ruffian, and both robbers fled by the way of the back door,
shutting off their bull's-eye as they ran.</p>

<p>The strangers shouted several times more, then rode by&mdash;there
seemed to be a dozen of the horses&mdash;and I heard nothing more.</p>

<p>I struggled, but could not free myself from my bonds. I tried
to speak, but the gag was effective; I could not make a sound. I
listened for my wife's voice and my child's&mdash;listened long and
intently, but no sound came from the other end of the room where
their bed was. This silence became more and more awful, more and
more ominous, every moment. Could you have endured an hour of it,
do you think? Pity me, then, who had to endure three. Three
hours&mdash;? it was three ages! Whenever the clock struck, it seemed
as if years had gone by since I had heard it last. All this time
I was struggling in my bonds; and at last, about dawn, I got
myself free, and rose up and stretched my stiff limbs. I was able
to distinguish details pretty well. The floor was littered with
things thrown there by the robbers during their search for my
savings. The first object that caught my particular attention was
a document of mine which I had seen the rougher of the two
ruffians glance at and then cast away. It had blood on it! I
staggered to the other end of the room. Oh, poor unoffending,
helpless ones, there they lay, their troubles ended, mine
begun!</p>

<p>Did I appeal to the law&mdash;I? Does it quench the pauper's thirst
if the King drink for him? Oh, no, no, no&mdash;I wanted no
impertinent interference of the law. Laws and the gallows could
not pay the debt that was owing to me! Let the laws leave the
matter in my hands, and have no fears: I would find the debtor
and collect the debt. How accomplish this, do you say? How
accomplish it, and feel so sure about it, when I had neither seen
the robbers' faces, nor heard their natural voices, nor had any
idea who they might be? Nevertheless, I WAS sure&mdash;quite sure,
quite confident. I had a clue&mdash;a clue which you would not have
valued&mdash;a clue which would not have greatly helped even a
detective, since he would lack the secret of how to apply it. I
shall come to that, presently&mdash;you shall see. Let us go on, now,
taking things in their due order. There was one circumstance
which gave me a slant in a definite direction to begin with:
Those two robbers were manifestly soldiers in tramp disguise; and
not new to military service, but old in it&mdash;regulars, perhaps;
they did not acquire their soldierly attitude, gestures,
carriage, in a day, nor a month, nor yet in a year. So I thought,
but said nothing. And one of them had said, 'the captain's voice,
by G&mdash;!'&mdash;the one whose life I would have. Two miles away,
several regiments were in camp, and two companies of U.S.
cavalry. When I learned that Captain Blakely, of Company C had
passed our way, that night, with an escort, I said nothing, but
in that company I resolved to seek my man. In conversation I
studiously and persistently described the robbers as tramps, camp
followers; and among this class the people made useless search,
none suspecting the soldiers but me.</p>

<p>Working patiently, by night, in my desolated home, I made a
disguise for myself out of various odds and ends of clothing; in
the nearest village I bought a pair of blue goggles. By-and-bye,
when the military camp broke up, and Company C was ordered a
hundred miles north, to Napoleon, I secreted my small hoard of
money in my belt, and took my departure in the night. When
Company C arrived in Napoleon, I was already there. Yes, I was
there, with a new trade&mdash;fortune-teller. Not to seem partial, I
made friends and told fortunes among all the companies garrisoned
there; but I gave Company C the great bulk of my attentions. I
made myself limitlessly obliging to these particular men; they
could ask me no favor, put upon me no risk, which I would
decline. I became the willing butt of their jokes; this perfected
my popularity; I became a favorite.</p>

<p>I early found a private who lacked a thumb&mdash;what joy it was to
me! And when I found that he alone, of all the company, had lost
a thumb, my last misgiving vanished; I was SURE I was on the
right track. This man's name was Kruger, a German. There were
nine Germans in the company. I watched, to see who might be his
intimates; but he seemed to have no especial intimates. But I was
his intimate; and I took care to make the intimacy grow.
Sometimes I so hungered for my revenge that I could hardly
restrain myself from going on my knees and begging him to point
out the man who had murdered my wife and child; but I managed to
bridle my tongue. I bided my time, and went on telling fortunes,
as opportunity offered.</p>

<img alt="345.jpg (145K)" src="images/345.jpg" height="919" width="588">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>My apparatus was simple: a little red paint and a bit of white
paper. I painted the ball of the client's thumb, took a print of
it on the paper, studied it that night, and revealed his fortune
to him next day. What was my idea in this nonsense? It was this:
When I was a youth, I knew an old Frenchman who had been a
prison-keeper for thirty years, and he told me that there was one
thing about a person which never changed, from the cradle to the
grave&mdash;the lines in the ball of the thumb; and he said that these
lines were never exactly alike in the thumbs of any two human
beings. In these days, we photograph the new criminal, and hang
his picture in the Rogues' Gallery for future reference; but that
Frenchman, in his day, used to take a print of the ball of a new
prisoner's thumb and put that away for future reference. He
always said that pictures were no good&mdash;future disguises could
make them useless; 'The thumb's the only sure thing,' said he;
'you can't disguise that.' And he used to prove his theory, too,
on my friends and acquaintances; it always succeeded.</p>

<a name="346"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="346.jpg (16K)" src="images/346.jpg" height="254" width="264">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>I went on telling fortunes. Every night I shut myself in, all
alone, and studied the day's thumb-prints with a
magnifying-glass. Imagine the devouring eagerness with which I
pored over those mazy red spirals, with that document by my side
which bore the right-hand thumb-and-finger-marks of that unknown
murderer, printed with the dearest blood&mdash;to me&mdash;that was ever
shed on this earth! And many and many a time I had to repeat the
same old disappointed remark, 'will they NEVER correspond!'</p>

<p>But my reward came at last. It was the print of the thumb of
the forty-third man of Company C whom I had experimented
on&mdash;Private Franz Adler. An hour before, I did not know the
murderer's name, or voice, or figure, or face, or nationality;
but now I knew all these things! I believed I might feel sure;
the Frenchman's repeated demonstrations being so good a warranty.
Still, there was a way to MAKE sure. I had an impression of
Kruger's left thumb. In the morning I took him aside when he was
off duty; and when we were out of sight and hearing of witnesses,
I said, impressively&mdash;</p>

<p>'A part of your fortune is so grave, that I thought it would
be better for you if I did not tell it in public. You and another
man, whose fortune I was studying last night,&mdash;Private
Adler,&mdash;have been murdering a woman and a child! You are being
dogged: within five days both of you will be assassinated.'</p>

<p>He dropped on his knees, frightened out of his wits; and for
five minutes he kept pouring out the same set of words, like a
demented person, and in the same half-crying way which was one of
my memories of that murderous night in my cabin&mdash;</p>

<a name="347"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="347.jpg (109K)" src="images/347.jpg" height="741" width="595">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>'I didn't do it; upon my soul I didn't do it; and I tried to
keep HIM from doing it; I did, as God is my witness. He did it
alone.'</p>

<p>This was all I wanted. And I tried to get rid of the fool; but
no, he clung to me, imploring me to save him from the assassin.
He said&mdash;</p>

<p>'I have money&mdash;ten thousand dollars&mdash;hid away, the fruit of
loot and thievery; save me&mdash;tell me what to do, and you shall
have it, every penny. Two-thirds of it is my cousin Adler's; but
you can take it all. We hid it when we first came here. But I hid
it in a new place yesterday, and have not told him&mdash;shall not
tell him. I was going to desert, and get away with it all. It is
gold, and too heavy to carry when one is running and dodging; but
a woman who has been gone over the river two days to prepare my
way for me is going to follow me with it; and if I got no chance
to describe the hiding-place to her I was going to slip my silver
watch into her hand, or send it to her, and she would understand.
There's a piece of paper in the back of the case, which tells it
all. Here, take the watch&mdash;tell me what to do!'</p>

<p>He was trying to press his watch upon me, and was exposing the
paper and explaining it to me, when Adler appeared on the scene,
about a dozen yards away. I said to poor Kruger&mdash;</p>

<p>'Put up your watch, I don't want it. You shan't come to any
harm. Go, now; I must tell Adler his fortune. Presently I will
tell you how to escape the assassin; meantime I shall have to
examine your thumbmark again. Say nothing to Adler about this
thing&mdash;say nothing to anybody.'</p>

<p>He went away filled with fright and gratitude, poor devil. I
told Adler a long fortune&mdash;purposely so long that I could not
finish it; promised to come to him on guard, that night, and tell
him the really important part of it&mdash;the tragical part of it, I
said&mdash;so must be out of reach of eavesdroppers. They always kept
a picket-watch outside the town&mdash;mere discipline and ceremony&mdash;no
occasion for it, no enemy around.</p>

<a name="349"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="349.jpg (118K)" src="images/349.jpg" height="652" width="640">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Toward midnight I set out, equipped with the countersign, and
picked my way toward the lonely region where Adler was to keep
his watch. It was so dark that I stumbled right on a dim figure
almost before I could get out a protecting word. The sentinel
hailed and I answered, both at the same moment. I added, 'It's
only me&mdash;the fortune-teller.' Then I slipped to the poor devil's
side, and without a word I drove my dirk into his heart! YA WOHL,
laughed I, it WAS the tragedy part of his fortune, indeed! As he
fell from his horse, he clutched at me, and my blue goggles
remained in his hand; and away plunged the beast dragging him,
with his foot in the stirrup.</p>

<p>I fled through the woods, and made good my escape, leaving the
accusing goggles behind me in that dead man's hand.</p>

<p>This was fifteen or sixteen years ago. Since then I have
wandered aimlessly about the earth, sometimes at work, sometimes
idle; sometimes with money, sometimes with none; but always tired
of life, and wishing it was done, for my mission here was
finished, with the act of that night; and the only pleasure,
solace, satisfaction I had, in all those tedious years, was in
the daily reflection, 'I have killed him!'</p>

<p>Four years ago, my health began to fail. I had wandered into
Munich, in my purposeless way. Being out of money, I sought work,
and got it; did my duty faithfully about a year, and was then
given the berth of night watchman yonder in that dead-house which
you visited lately. The place suited my mood. I liked it. I liked
being with the dead&mdash;liked being alone with them. I used to
wander among those rigid corpses, and peer into their austere
faces, by the hour. The later the time, the more impressive it
was; I preferred the late time. Sometimes I turned the lights
low: this gave perspective, you see; and the imagination could
play; always, the dim receding ranks of the dead inspired one
with weird and fascinating fancies. Two years ago&mdash;I had been
there a year then&mdash;I was sitting all alone in the watch-room, one
gusty winter's night, chilled, numb, comfortless; drowsing
gradually into unconsciousness; the sobbing of the wind and the
slamming of distant shutters falling fainter and fainter upon my
dulling ear each moment, when sharp and suddenly that dead-bell
rang out a blood-curdling alarum over my head! The shock of it
nearly paralyzed me; for it was the first time I had ever heard
it.</p>

<p>I gathered myself together and flew to the corpse-room. About
midway down the outside rank, a shrouded figure was sitting
upright, wagging its head slowly from one side to the other&mdash;a
grisly spectacle! Its side was toward me. I hurried to it and
peered into its face. Heavens, it was Adler!</p>

<a name="350"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="350.jpg (74K)" src="images/350.jpg" height="543" width="437">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Can you divine what my first thought was? Put into words, it
was this: 'It seems, then, you escaped me once: there will be a
different result this time!'</p>

<p>Evidently this creature was suffering unimaginable terrors.
Think what it must have been to wake up in the midst of that
voiceless hush, and, look out over that grim congregation of the
dead! What gratitude shone in his skinny white face when he saw a
living form before him! And how the fervency of this mute
gratitude was augmented when his eyes fell upon the life-giving
cordials which I carried in my hands! Then imagine the horror
which came into this pinched face when I put the cordials behind
me, and said mockingly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Speak up, Franz Adler&mdash;call upon these dead. Doubtless they
will listen and have pity; but here there is none else that
will.'</p>

<p>He tried to speak, but that part of the shroud which bound his
jaws, held firm and would not let him. He tried to lift imploring
hands, but they were crossed upon his breast and tied. I
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Shout, Franz Adler; make the sleepers in the distant streets
hear you and bring help. Shout&mdash;and lose no time, for there is
little to lose. What, you cannot? That is a pity; but it is no
matter&mdash;it does not always bring help. When you and your cousin
murdered a helpless woman and child in a cabin in Arkansas&mdash;my
wife, it was, and my child!&mdash;they shrieked for help, you
remember; but it did no good; you remember that it did no good,
is it not so? Your teeth chatter&mdash;then why cannot you shout?
Loosen the bandages with your hands&mdash;then you can. Ah, I
see&mdash;your hands are tied, they cannot aid you. How strangely things
repeat themselves, after long years; for MY hands were tied, that
night, you remember? Yes, tied much as yours are now&mdash;how odd
that is. I could not pull free. It did not occur to you to untie
me; it does not occur to me to untie you. Sh&mdash;! there's a late
footstep. It is coming this way. Hark, how near it is! One can
count the footfalls&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three. There&mdash;it is just outside.
Now is the time! Shout, man, shout!&mdash;it is the one sole chance
between you and eternity! Ah, you see you have delayed too
long&mdash;it is gone by. There&mdash;it is dying out. It is gone! Think of
it&mdash;reflect upon it&mdash;you have heard a human footstep for the last
time. How curious it must be, to listen to so common a sound as
that, and know that one will never hear the fellow to it
again.'</p>

<p>Oh, my friend, the agony in that shrouded face was ecstasy to
see! I thought of a new torture, and applied it&mdash;assisting myself
with a trifle of lying invention&mdash;</p>

<p>'That poor Kruger tried to save my wife and child, and I did
him a grateful good turn for it when the time came. I persuaded
him to rob you; and I and a woman helped him to desert, and got
him away in safety.' A look as of surprise and triumph shone out
dimly through the anguish in my victim's face. I was disturbed,
disquieted. I said&mdash;</p>

<p>'What, then&mdash;didn't he escape?'</p>

<p>A negative shake of the head.</p>

<p>'No? What happened, then?'</p>

<p>The satisfaction in the shrouded face was still plainer. The
man tried to mumble out some words&mdash;could not succeed; tried to
express something with his obstructed hands&mdash;failed; paused a
moment, then feebly tilted his head, in a meaning way, toward the
corpse that lay nearest him.</p>

<p>'Dead?' I asked. 'Failed to escape?&mdash;caught in the act and
shot?'</p>

<p>Negative shake of the head.</p>

<p>'How, then?'</p>

<p>Again the man tried to do something with his hands. I watched
closely, but could not guess the intent. I bent over and watched
still more intently. He had twisted a thumb around and was weakly
punching at his breast with it. 'Ah&mdash;stabbed, do you mean?'</p>

<p>Affirmative nod, accompanied by a spectral smile of such
peculiar devilishness, that it struck an awakening light through
my dull brain, and I cried&mdash;</p>

<p>'Did I stab him, mistaking him for you?&mdash;for that stroke was
meant for none but you.'</p>

<p>The affirmative nod of the re-dying rascal was as joyous as
his failing strength was able to put into its expression.</p>

<p>'O, miserable, miserable me, to slaughter the pitying soul
that, stood a friend to my darlings when they were helpless, and
would have saved them if he could! miserable, oh, miserable,
miserable me!'</p>

<p>I fancied I heard the muffled gurgle of a mocking laugh. I
took my face out of my hands, and saw my enemy sinking back upon
his inclined board.</p>

<p>He was a satisfactory long time dying. He had a wonderful
vitality, an astonishing constitution. Yes, he was a pleasant
long time at it. I got a chair and a newspaper, and sat down by
him and read. Occasionally I took a sip of brandy. This was
necessary, on account of the cold. But I did it partly because I
saw, that along at first, whenever I reached for the bottle, he
thought I was going to give him some. I read aloud: mainly
imaginary accounts of people snatched from the grave's threshold
and restored to life and vigor by a few spoonsful of liquor and a
warm bath. Yes, he had a long, hard death of it&mdash;three hours and
six minutes, from the time he rang his bell.</p>

<p>It is believed that in all these eighteen years that have
elapsed since the institution of the corpse-watch, no shrouded
occupant of the Bavarian dead-houses has ever rung its bell.
Well, it is a harmless belief. Let it stand at that.</p>

<p>The chill of that death-room had penetrated my bones. It
revived and fastened upon me the disease which had been
afflicting me, but which, up to that night, had been steadily
disappearing. That man murdered my wife and my child; and in
three days hence he will have added me to his list. No
matter&mdash;God! how delicious the memory of it!&mdash;I caught him
escaping from his grave, and thrust him back into it.</p>

<p>After that night, I was confined to my bed for a week; but as
soon as I could get about, I went to the dead-house books and got
the number of the house which Adler had died in. A wretched
lodging-house, it was. It was my idea that he would naturally
have gotten hold of Kruger's effects, being his cousin; and I
wanted to get Kruger's watch, if I could. But while I was sick,
Adler's things had been sold and scattered, all except a few old
letters, and some odds and ends of no value. However, through
those letters, I traced out a son of Kruger's, the only relative
left. He is a man of thirty now, a shoemaker by trade, and living
at No. 14 Konigstrasse, Mannheim&mdash;widower, with several small
children. Without explaining to him why, I have furnished
two-thirds of his support, ever since.</p>

<p>Now, as to that watch&mdash;see how strangely things happen! I
traced it around and about Germany for more than a year, at
considerable cost in money and vexation; and at last I got it.
Got it, and was unspeakably glad; opened it, and found nothing in
it! Why, I might have known that that bit of paper was not going
to stay there all this time. Of course I gave up that ten
thousand dollars then; gave it up, and dropped it out of my mind:
and most sorrowfully, for I had wanted it for Kruger's son.</p>

<p>Last night, when I consented at last that I must die, I began
to make ready. I proceeded to burn all useless papers; and sure
enough, from a batch of Adler's, not previously examined with
thoroughness, out dropped that long-desired scrap! I recognized
it in a moment. Here it is&mdash;I will translate it:</p>

<p>'Brick livery stable, stone foundation, middle of town, corner
of Orleans and Market. Corner toward Court-house. Third stone,
fourth row. Stick notice there, saying how many are to come.'</p>

<p>There&mdash;take it, and preserve it. Kruger explained that that
stone was removable; and that it was in the north wall of the
foundation, fourth row from the top, and third stone from the
west. The money is secreted behind it. He said the closing
sentence was a blind, to mislead in case the paper should fall
into wrong hands. It probably performed that office for
Adler.</p>

<p>Now I want to beg that when you make your intended journey
down the river, you will hunt out that hidden money, and send it
to Adam Kruger, care of the Mannheim address which I have
mentioned. It will make a rich man of him, and I shall sleep the
sounder in my grave for knowing that I have done what I could for
the son of the man who tried to save my wife and child&mdash;albeit my
hand ignorantly struck him down, whereas the impulse of my heart
would have been to shield and serve him.</p>

<h3>The Disposal of a Bonanza</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>'SUCH was Ritter's narrative,' said I to my two friends. There
was a profound and impressive silence, which lasted a
considerable time; then both men broke into a fusillade of
exciting and admiring ejaculations over the strange incidents of
the tale; and this, along with a rattling fire of questions, was
kept up until all hands were about out of breath. Then my friends
began to cool down, and draw off, under shelter of occasional
volleys, into silence and abysmal reverie. For ten minutes now,
there was stillness. Then Rogers said dreamily&mdash;</p>

<p>'Ten thousand dollars.'</p>

<p>Adding, after a considerable pause&mdash;</p>

<p>'Ten thousand. It is a heap of money.'</p>

<p>Presently the poet inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>'Are you going to send it to him right away?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said. 'It is a queer question.'</p>

<p>No reply. After a little, Rogers asked, hesitatingly:</p>

<p>'ALL of it?&mdash;That is&mdash;I mean&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Certainly, all of it.'</p>

<p>I was going to say more, but stopped&mdash;was stopped by a train
of thought which started up in me. Thompson spoke, but my mind
was absent, and I did not catch what he said. But I heard Rogers
answer&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes, it seems so to me. It ought to be quite sufficient; for
I don't see that he has done anything.'</p>

<p>Presently the poet said&mdash;</p>

<p>'When you come to look at it, it is more than sufficient. Just
look at it&mdash;five thousand dollars! Why, he couldn't spend it in a
lifetime! And it would injure him, too; perhaps ruin him&mdash;you
want to look at that. In a little while he would throw his last
away, shut up his shop, maybe take to drinking, maltreat his
motherless children, drift into other evil courses, go steadily
from bad to worse&mdash;'</p>

<a name="358"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="358.jpg (98K)" src="images/358.jpg" height="652" width="597">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>'Yes, that's it,' interrupted Rogers, fervently, 'I've seen it
a hundred times&mdash;yes, more than a hundred. You put money into the
hands of a man like that, if you want to destroy him, that's all;
just put money into his hands, it's all you've got to do; and if
it don't pull him down, and take all the usefulness out of him,
and all the self-respect and everything, then I don't know human
nature&mdash;ain't that so, Thompson? And even if we were to give him
a THIRD of it; why, in less than six months&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Less than six WEEKS, you'd better say!' said I, warming up
and breaking in. 'Unless he had that three thousand dollars in
safe hands where he couldn't touch it, he would no more last you
six weeks than&mdash;'</p>

<a name="359"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="359.jpg (55K)" src="images/359.jpg" height="515" width="416">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>'Of COURSE he wouldn't,' said Thompson; 'I've edited books for
that kind of people; and the moment they get their hands on the
royalty&mdash;maybe it's three thousand, maybe it's two
thousand&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What business has that shoemaker with two thousand dollars, I
should like to know?' broke in Rogers, earnestly. 'A man perhaps
perfectly contented now, there in Mannheim, surrounded by his own
class, eating his bread with the appetite which laborious
industry alone can give, enjoying his humble life, honest,
upright, pure in heart; and BLEST!&mdash;yes, I say blest! blest
above all the myriads that go in silk attire and walk the empty
artificial round of social folly&mdash;but just you put that
temptation before him once! just you lay fifteen hundred dollars
before a man like that, and say&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Fifteen hundred devils!' cried I, 'FIVE hundred would rot his
principles, paralyze his industry, drag him to the rumshop,
thence to the gutter, thence to the almshouse, thence to
&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'WHY put upon ourselves this crime, gentlemen?' interrupted
the poet earnestly and appealingly. 'He is happy where he is, and
AS he is. Every sentiment of honor, every sentiment of charity,
every sentiment of high and sacred benevolence warns us,
beseeches us, commands us to leave him undisturbed. That is real
friendship, that is true friendship. We could follow other
courses that would be more showy; but none that would be so truly
kind and wise, depend upon it.'</p>

<br><br>

<p>After some further talk, it became evident that each of us,
down in his heart, felt some misgivings over this settlement of
the matter. It was manifest that we all felt that we ought to
send the poor shoemaker SOMETHING. There was long and thoughtful
discussion of this point; and we finally decided to send him a
chromo.</p>

<p>Well, now that everything seemed to be arranged satisfactorily
to everybody concerned, a new trouble broke out: it transpired
that these two men were expecting to share equally in the money
with me. That was not my idea. I said that if they got half of it
between them they might consider themselves lucky. Rogers
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Who would have had ANY if it hadn't been for me? I flung out
the first hint&mdash;but for that it would all have gone to the
shoemaker.'</p>

<p>Thompson said that he was thinking of the thing himself at the
very moment that Rogers had originally spoken.</p>

<p>I retorted that the idea would have occurred to me plenty soon
enough, and without anybody's help. I was slow about thinking,
maybe, but I was sure.</p>

<p>This matter warmed up into a quarrel; then into a fight; and
each man got pretty badly battered. As soon as I had got myself
mended up after a fashion, I ascended to the hurricane deck in a
pretty sour humor. I found Captain McCord there, and said, as
pleasantly as my humor would permit&mdash;</p>

<p>'I have come to say good-bye, captain. I wish to go ashore at
Napoleon.'</p>

<p>'Go ashore where?'</p>

<p>'Napoleon.'</p>

<p>The captain laughed; but seeing that I was not in a jovial
mood, stopped that and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'But are you serious?'</p>

<p>'Serious? I certainly am.'</p>

<p>The captain glanced up at the pilot-house and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'He wants to get off at Napoleon!'</p>

<p>'Napoleon?'</p>

<p>'That's what he says.'</p>

<p>'Great Caesar's ghost!'</p>

<p>Uncle Mumford approached along the deck. The captain
said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Uncle, here's a friend of yours wants to get off at
Napoleon!'</p>

<p>'Well, by &mdash;?'</p>

<p>I said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Come, what is all this about? Can't a man go ashore at
Napoleon if he wants to?'</p>

<p>'Why, hang it, don't you know? There ISN'T any Napoleon any
more. Hasn't been for years and years. The Arkansas River burst
through it, tore it all to rags, and emptied it into the
Mississippi!'</p>

<p>'Carried the WHOLE town away?-banks, churches, jails,
newspaper-offices, court-house, theater, fire department, livery
stable EVERYTHING ?'</p>

<p>'Everything. just a fifteen-minute job.' or such a matter.
Didn't leave hide nor hair, shred nor shingle of it, except the
fag-end of a shanty and one brick chimney. This boat is paddling
along right now, where the dead-center of that town used to be;
yonder is the brick chimney-all that's left of Napoleon. These
dense woods on the right used to be a mile back of the town. Take
a look behind you&mdash;up-stream&mdash;now you begin to recognize this
country, don't you?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I do recognize it now. It is the most wonderful thing I
ever heard of; by a long shot the most wonderful&mdash;and
unexpected.'</p>

<p>Mr. Thompson and Mr. Rogers had arrived, meantime, with
satchels and umbrellas, and had silently listened to the
captain's news. Thompson put a half-dollar in my hand and said
softly&mdash;</p>

<p>'For my share of the chromo.'</p>

<p>Rogers followed suit.</p>

<p>Yes, it was an astonishing thing to see the Mississippi
rolling between unpeopled shores and straight over the spot where
I used to see a good big self-complacent town twenty years ago.
Town that was county-seat of a great and important county; town
with a big United States marine hospital; town of innumerable
fights&mdash;an inquest every day; town where I had used to know the
prettiest girl, and the most accomplished in the whole
Mississippi Valley; town where we were handed the first printed
news of the 'Pennsylvania's' mournful disaster a quarter of a
century ago; a town no more&mdash;swallowed up, vanished, gone to feed
the fishes; nothing left but a fragment of a shanty and a
crumbling brick chimney!</p>

<h3>Refreshments and Ethics</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>IN regard to Island 74, which is situated not far from the
former Napoleon, a freak of the river here has sorely perplexed
the laws of men and made them a vanity and a jest. When the State
of Arkansas was chartered, she controlled 'to the center of the
river'&mdash;a most unstable line. The State of Mississippi claimed
'to the channel'&mdash;another shifty and unstable line. No. 74
belonged to Arkansas. By and by a cut-off threw this big island
out of Arkansas, and yet not within Mississippi. 'Middle of the
river' on one side of it, 'channel' on the other. That is as I
understand the problem. Whether I have got the details right or
wrong, this FACT remains: that here is this big and exceedingly
valuable island of four thousand acres, thrust out in the cold,
and belonging to neither the one State nor the other; paying
taxes to neither, owing allegiance to neither. One man owns the
whole island, and of right is 'the man without a country.'</p>

<p>Island 92 belongs to Arkansas. The river moved it over and
joined it to Mississippi. A chap established a whiskey shop
there, without a Mississippi license, and enriched himself upon
Mississippi custom under Arkansas protection (where no license
was in those days required).</p>

<p>We glided steadily down the river in the usual
privacy&mdash;steamboat or other moving thing seldom seen. Scenery as
always: stretch upon stretch of almost unbroken forest, on both
sides of the river; soundless solitude. Here and there a cabin or
two, standing in small openings on the gray and grassless
banks&mdash;cabins which had formerly stood a quarter or half-mile
farther to the front, and gradually been pulled farther and
farther back as the shores caved in. As at Pilcher's Point, for
instance, where the cabins had been moved back three hundred
yards in three months, so we were told; but the caving banks had
already caught up with them, and they were being conveyed
rearward once more.</p>

<p>Napoleon had but small opinion of Greenville, Mississippi, in
the old times; but behold, Napoleon is gone to the cat-fishes,
and here is Greenville full of life and activity, and making a
considerable flourish in the Valley; having three thousand
inhabitants, it is said, and doing a gross trade of $2,500,000
annually. A growing town.</p>

<p>There was much talk on the boat about the Calhoun Land
Company, an enterprise which is expected to work wholesome
results. Colonel Calhoun, a grandson of the statesman, went to
Boston and formed a syndicate which purchased a large tract of
land on the river, in Chicot County, Arkansas&mdash;some ten thousand
acres&mdash;for cotton-growing. The purpose is to work on a cash
basis: buy at first hands, and handle their own product; supply
their negro laborers with provisions and necessaries at a
trifling profit, say 8 or 10 per cent.; furnish them comfortable
quarters, etc., and encourage them to save money and remain on
the place. If this proves a financial success, as seems quite
certain, they propose to establish a banking-house in Greenville,
and lend money at an unburdensome rate of interest&mdash;6 per cent.
is spoken of.</p>

<p>The trouble heretofore has been&mdash;I am quoting remarks of
planters and steamboatmen&mdash;that the planters, although owning the
land, were without cash capital; had to hypothecate both land and
crop to carry on the business. Consequently, the commission
dealer who furnishes the money takes some risk and demands big
interest&mdash;usually 10 per cent., and 2{half} per cent. for
negotiating the loan. The planter has also to buy his supplies
through the same dealer, paying commissions and profits. Then
when he ships his crop, the dealer adds his commissions,
insurance, etc. So, taking it by and large, and first and last,
the dealer's share of that crop is about 25 per cent.'{footnote
['But what can the State do where the people are under subjection
to rates of interest ranging from 18 to 30 per cent., and are
also under the necessity of purchasing their crops in advance
even of planting, at these rates, for the privilege of purchasing
all their supplies at 100 per cent. profit?'&mdash;EDWARD
ATKINSON.]}</p>

<p>A cotton-planter's estimate of the average margin of profit on
planting, in his section: One man and mule will raise ten acres
of cotton, giving ten bales cotton, worth, say, $500; cost of
producing, say $350; net profit, $150, or $15 per acre. There is
also a profit now from the cotton-seed, which formerly had little
value&mdash;none where much transportation was necessary. In sixteen
hundred pounds crude cotton four hundred are lint, worth, say,
ten cents a pound; and twelve hundred pounds of seed, worth $12
or $13 per ton. Maybe in future even the stems will not be thrown
away. Mr. Edward Atkinson says that for each bale of cotton there
are fifteen hundred pounds of stems, and that these are very rich
in phosphate of lime and potash; that when ground and mixed with
ensilage or cotton-seed meal (which is too rich for use as fodder
in large quantities), the stem mixture makes a superior food,
rich in all the elements needed for the production of milk, meat,
and bone. Heretofore the stems have been considered a
nuisance.</p>

<p>Complaint is made that the planter remains grouty toward the
former slave, since the war; will have nothing but a chill
business relation with him, no sentiment permitted to intrude,
will not keep a 'store' himself, and supply the negro's wants and
thus protect the negro's pocket and make him able and willing to
stay on the place and an advantage to him to do it, but lets that
privilege to some thrifty Israelite, who encourages the
thoughtless negro and wife to buy all sorts of things which they
could do without&mdash;buy on credit, at big prices, month after
month, credit based on the negro's share of the growing crop; and
at the end of the season, the negro's share belongs to the
Israelite,' the negro is in debt besides, is discouraged,
dissatisfied, restless, and both he and the planter are injured;
for he will take steamboat and migrate, and the planter must get
a stranger in his place who does not know him, does not care for
him, will fatten the Israelite a season, and follow his
predecessor per steamboat.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the Calhoun Company will show, by its humane
and protective treatment of its laborers, that its method is the
most profitable for both planter and negro; and it is believed

<p>And where so many are saying their say, shall not the
barkeeper testify? He is thoughtful, observant, never drinks;
endeavors to earn his salary, and WOULD earn it if there were
custom enough. He says the people along here in Mississippi and
Louisiana will send up the river to buy vegetables rather than
raise them, and they will come aboard at the landings and buy
fruits of the barkeeper. Thinks they 'don't know anything but
cotton;' believes they don't know how to raise vegetables and
fruit&mdash;'at least the most of them.' Says 'a nigger will go to H
for a watermelon' ('H' is all I find in the stenographer's
report&mdash;means Halifax probably, though that seems a good way to
go for a watermelon). Barkeeper buys watermelons for five cents
up the river, brings them down and sells them for fifty. 'Why
does he mix such elaborate and picturesque drinks for the nigger
hands on the boat?' Because they won't have any other. 'They want
a big drink; don't make any difference what you make it of, they
want the worth of their money. You give a nigger a plain gill of
half-a-dollar brandy for five cents&mdash;will he touch it? No. Ain't
size enough to it. But you put up a pint of all kinds of
worthless rubbish, and heave in some red stuff to make it

glass to go to a circus.'

All the bars on this Anchor Line are
rented and owned by one firm. They furnish the liquors from their
own establishment, and hire the barkeepers 'on salary.' Good
liquors? Yes, on some of the boats, where there are the kind of
passengers that want it and can pay for it. On the other boats?
No. Nobody but the deck hands and firemen to drink it. 'Brandy?
Yes, I've got brandy, plenty of it; but you don't want any of it
unless you've made your will.' It isn't as it used to be in the
old times. Then everybody traveled by steamboat, everybody drank,
and everybody treated everybody else. 'Now most everybody goes by
railroad, and the rest don't drink.' In the old times the
barkeeper owned the bar himself, 'and was gay and smarty and
talky and all jeweled up, and was the toniest aristocrat on the
boat; used to make $2,000 on a trip. A father who left his son a
steamboat bar, left him a fortune. Now he leaves him board and
lodging; yes, and washing, if a shirt a trip will do. Yes,
indeedy, times are changed. Why, do you know, on the principal
line of boats on the Upper Mississippi, they don't have any bar
at all! Sounds like poetry, but it's the petrified truth.'</p>

<p>STACK ISLAND. I remembered Stack Island; also Lake Providence,
Louisiana&mdash;which is the first distinctly Southern-looking town
you come to, downward-bound; lies level and low, shade-trees hung
with venerable gray beards of Spanish moss; 'restful, pensive,
Sunday aspect about the place,' comments Uncle Mumford, with
feeling&mdash;also with truth.</p>

<p>A Mr. H. furnished some minor details of fact concerning this
region which I would have hesitated to believe if I had not known
him to be a steamboat mate. He was a passenger of ours, a
resident of Arkansas City, and bound to Vicksburg to join his
boat, a little Sunflower packet. He was an austere man, and had
the reputation of being singularly unworldly, for a river man.
Among other things, he said that Arkansas had been injured and
kept back by generations of exaggerations concerning the
mosquitoes here. One may smile, said he, and turn the matter off
as being a small thing; but when you come to look at the effects
produced, in the way of discouragement of immigration, and
diminished values of property, it was quite the opposite of a
small thing, or thing in any wise to be coughed down or sneered
at. These mosquitoes had been persistently represented as being
formidable and lawless; whereas 'the truth is, they are feeble,
insignificant in size, diffident to a fault, sensitive'&mdash;and so
on, and so on; you would have supposed he was talking about his
family. But if he was soft on the Arkansas mosquitoes, he was
hard enough on the mosquitoes of Lake Providence to make up for
it&mdash;'those Lake Providence colossi,' as he finely called them. He
said that two of them could whip a dog, and that four of them
could hold a man down; and except help come, they would kill
him&mdash;'butcher him,' as he expressed it. Referred in a sort of
casual way&mdash;and yet significant way&mdash;to 'the fact that the life
policy in its simplest form is unknown in Lake Providence&mdash;they
take out a mosquito policy besides.' He told many remarkable
things about those lawless insects. Among others, said he had
seen them try to vote. Noticing that this statement seemed to be
a good deal of a strain on us, he modified it a little: said he
might have been mistaken, as to that particular, but knew he had
seen them around the polls 'canvassing.'</p>

<br><br>

<p>There was another passenger&mdash;friend of H.'s&mdash;who backed up the
harsh evidence against those mosquitoes, and detailed some
stirring adventures which he had had with them. The stories were
pretty sizable, merely pretty sizable; yet Mr. H. was continually
interrupting with a cold, inexorable 'Wait&mdash;knock off twenty-five
per cent. of that; now go on;' or, 'Wait&mdash;you are getting that
too strong; cut it down, cut it down&mdash;you get a leetle too much
costumery on to your statements: always dress a fact in tights,
never in an ulster;' or, 'Pardon, once more: if you are going to
load anything more on to that statement, you want to get a couple
of lighters and tow the rest, because it's drawing all the water
there is in the river already; stick to facts&mdash;just stick to the
cold facts; what these gentlemen want for a book is the frozen
truth&mdash;ain't that so, gentlemen?' He explained privately that it
was necessary to watch this man all the time, and keep him within
bounds; it would not do to neglect this precaution, as he, Mr.
H., 'knew to his sorrow.' Said he, 'I will not deceive you; he
told me such a monstrous lie once, that it swelled my left ear
up, and spread it so that I was actually not able to see out
around it; it remained so for months, and people came miles to
see me fan myself with it.'</p>

<p>WE used to plow past the lofty hill-city, Vicksburg,
down-stream; but we cannot do that now. A cut-off has made a
country town of it, like Osceola, St. Genevieve, and several
others. There is currentless water&mdash;also a big island&mdash;in front
of Vicksburg now. You come down the river the other side of the
island, then turn and come up to the town; that is, in high
water: in low water you can't come up, but must land some
distance below it.</p>

<p>Signs and scars still remain, as reminders of Vicksburg's
tremendous war experiences; earthworks, trees crippled by the
cannon balls, cave-refuges in the clay precipices, etc. The
caves did good service during the six weeks' bombardment of the
city&mdash;May 8 to July 4, 1863. They were used by the
non-combatants&mdash;mainly by the women and children; not to live in
constantly, but to fly to for safety on occasion. They were mere
holes, tunnels, driven into the perpendicular clay bank, then
branched Y shape, within the hill. Life in Vicksburg, during the
six weeks was perhaps&mdash;but wait; here are some materials out of
which to reproduce it:&mdash;</p>

<p>Population, twenty-seven thousand soldiers and three thousand
non-combatants; the city utterly cut off from the world&mdash;walled
solidly in, the frontage by gunboats, the rear by soldiers and
batteries; hence, no buying and selling with the outside; no
passing to and fro; no God-speeding a parting guest, no
welcoming a coming one; no printed acres of world-wide news to be
read at breakfast, mornings&mdash;a tedious dull absence of such
matter, instead; hence, also, no running to see steamboats
smoking into view in the distance up or down, and plowing toward
the town&mdash;for none came, the river lay vacant and undisturbed; no
rush and turmoil around the railway station, no struggling over
bewildered swarms of passengers by noisy mobs of hackmen&mdash;all
quiet there; flour two hundred dollars a barrel, sugar thirty,
corn ten dollars a bushel, bacon five dollars a pound, rum a
hundred dollars a gallon; other things in proportion:
consequently, no roar and racket of drays and carriages tearing
along the streets; nothing for them to do, among that handful of
non-combatants of exhausted means; at three o'clock in the
morning, silence; silence so dead that the measured tramp of a
sentinel can be heard a seemingly impossible distance; out of
hearing of this lonely sound, perhaps the stillness is absolute:
all in a moment come ground-shaking thunder-crashes of artillery,
the sky is cobwebbed with the crisscrossing red lines streaming
from soaring bomb-shells, and a rain of iron fragments descends
upon the city; descends upon the empty streets: streets which are
not empty a moment later, but mottled with dim figures of frantic
women and children scurrying from home and bed toward the cave
dungeons&mdash;encouraged by the humorous grim soldiery, who shout
'Rats, to your holes!' and laugh.</p>

<img alt="377.jpg (92K)" src="images/377.jpg" height="539" width="606">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The cannon-thunder rages, shells scream and crash overhead,
the iron rain pours down, one hour, two hours, three, possibly
six, then stops; silence follows, but the streets are still
empty; the silence continues; by-and-bye a head projects from a
cave here and there and yonder, and reconnoitres, cautiously; the
silence still continuing, bodies follow heads, and jaded, half
smothered creatures group themselves about, stretch their cramped
limbs, draw in deep draughts of the grateful fresh air, gossip
with the neighbors from the next cave; maybe straggle off home
presently, or take a lounge through the town, if the stillness
continues; and will scurry to the holes again, by-and-bye, when
the war-tempest breaks forth once more.</p>

<p>There being but three thousand of these cave-dwellers&mdash;merely
the population of a village&mdash;would they not come to know each
other, after a week or two, and familiarly; insomuch that the
fortunate or unfortunate experiences of one would be of interest
to all?</p>

<p>Those are the materials furnished by history. From them might
not almost anybody reproduce for himself the life of that time in
Vicksburg? Could you, who did not experience it, come nearer to
reproducing it to the imagination of another non-participant than
could a Vicksburger who did experience it? It seems impossible;
and yet there are reasons why it might not really be. When one
makes his first voyage in a ship, it is an experience which
multitudinously bristles with striking novelties; novelties which
are in such sharp contrast with all this person's former
experiences that they take a seemingly deathless grip upon his
imagination and memory. By tongue or pen he can make a landsman
live that strange and stirring voyage over with him; make him see
it all and feel it all. But if he wait? If he make ten voyages in
succession&mdash;what then? Why, the thing has lost color, snap,
surprise; and has become commonplace. The man would have nothing
to tell that would quicken a landsman's pulse.</p>

<p>Years ago, I talked with a couple of the Vicksburg
non-combatants&mdash;a man and his wife. Left to tell their story in
their own way, those people told it without fire, almost without
interest.</p>

<p>A week of their wonderful life there would have made their
tongues eloquent for ever perhaps; but they had six weeks of it,
and that wore the novelty all out; they got used to being
bomb-shelled out of home and into the ground; the matter became
commonplace. After that, the possibility of their ever being
startlingly interesting in their talks about it was gone. What
the man said was to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>'It got to be Sunday all the time. Seven Sundays in the
week&mdash;to us, anyway. We hadn't anything to do, and time hung
heavy. Seven Sundays, and all of them broken up at one time or
another, in the day or in the night, by a few hours of the awful
storm of fire and thunder and iron. At first we used to shin for
the holes a good deal faster than we did afterwards. The first
time, I forgot the children, and Maria fetched them both along.
When she was all safe in the cave she fainted. Two or three weeks
afterwards, when she was running for the holes, one morning,
through a shell-shower, a big shell burst near her, and covered
her all over with dirt, and a piece of the iron carried away her
game-bag of false hair from the back of her head. Well, she
stopped to get that game-bag before she shoved along again! Was
getting used to things already, you see. We all got so that we
could tell a good deal about shells; and after that we didn't
always go under shelter if it was a light shower. Us men would
loaf around and talk; and a man would say, 'There she goes!' and
name the kind of shell it was from the sound of it, and go on
talking&mdash;if there wasn't any danger from it. If a shell was
bursting close over us, we stopped talking and stood
still;&mdash;uncomfortable, yes, but it wasn't safe to move. When it let go,
we went on talking again, if nobody hurt&mdash;maybe saying, 'That was
a ripper!' or some such commonplace comment before we resumed;
or, maybe, we would see a shell poising itself away high in the
air overhead. In that case, every fellow just whipped out a
sudden, 'See you again, gents!' and shoved. Often and often I saw
gangs of ladies promenading the streets, looking as cheerful as
you please, and keeping an eye canted up watching the shells; and
I've seen them stop still when they were uncertain about what a
shell was going to do, and wait and make certain; and after that
they sa'ntered along again, or lit out for shelter, according to
the verdict. Streets in some towns have a litter of pieces of
paper, and odds and ends of one sort or another lying around.
Ours hadn't; they had IRON litter. Sometimes a man would gather
up all the iron fragments and unbursted shells in his
neighborhood, and pile them into a kind of monument in his front
yard&mdash;a ton of it, sometimes. No glass left; glass couldn't stand
such a bombardment; it was all shivered out. Windows of the
houses vacant&mdash;looked like eye-holes in a skull. WHOLE panes were
as scarce as news.</p>

<p>'We had church Sundays. Not many there, along at first; but
by-and-bye pretty good turnouts. I've seen service stop a minute,
and everybody sit quiet&mdash;no voice heard, pretty funeral-like
then&mdash;and all the more so on account of the awful boom and crash
going on outside and overhead; and pretty soon, when a body could
be heard, service would go on again. Organs and church-music
mixed up with a bombardment is a powerful queer
combination&mdash;along at first. Coming out of church, one morning,
we had an accident&mdash;the only one that happened around me on a
Sunday. I was just having a hearty handshake with a friend I
hadn't seen for a while, and saying, 'Drop into our cave
to-night, after bombardment; we've got hold of a pint of prime
wh&mdash;.' Whiskey, I was going to say, you know, but a shell
interrupted. A chunk of it cut the man's arm off, and left it
dangling in my hand. And do you know the thing that is going to
stick the longest in my memory, and outlast everything else,
little and big, I reckon, is the mean thought I had then? It was
'the whiskey IS SAVED.' And yet, don't you know, it was kind of
excusable; because it was as scarce as diamonds, and we had only
just that little; never had another taste during the siege.</p>

<p>'Sometimes the caves were desperately crowded, and always hot
and close. Sometimes a cave had twenty or twenty-five people
packed into it; no turning-room for anybody; air so foul,
sometimes, you couldn't have made a candle burn in it. A child
was born in one of those caves one night, Think of that; why, it
was like having it born in a trunk.</p>

<p>'Twice we had sixteen people in our cave; and a number of
times we had a dozen. Pretty suffocating in there. We always had
eight; eight belonged there. Hunger and misery and sickness and
fright and sorrow, and I don't know what all, got so loaded into
them that none of them were ever rightly their old selves after
the siege. They all died but three of us within a couple of
years. One night a shell burst in front of the hole and caved it
in and stopped it up. It was lively times, for a while, digging
out. Some of us came near smothering. After that we made two
openings&mdash;ought to have thought of it at first.</p>

<p>'Mule meat. No, we only got down to that the last day or two.
Of course it was good; anything is good when you are
starving.</p>

<p>This man had kept a diary during&mdash;six weeks? No, only the
first six days. The first day, eight close pages; the second,
five; the third, one&mdash;loosely written; the fourth, three or four
lines; a line or two the fifth and sixth days; seventh day, diary
abandoned; life in terrific Vicksburg having now become
commonplace and matter of course.</p>

<p>The war history of Vicksburg has more about it to interest the
general reader than that of any other of the river-towns. It is
full of variety, full of incident, full of the picturesque.
Vicksburg held out longer than any other important river-town,
and saw warfare in all its phases, both land and water&mdash;the
siege, the mine, the assault, the repulse, the bombardment,
sickness, captivity, famine.</p>

<p>The most beautiful of all the national cemeteries is here.
Over the great gateway is this inscription:&mdash;</p>

<p>"HERE REST IN PEACE 16,600 WHO DIED FOR THEIR COUNTRY IN THE
YEARS 1861 TO 1865."</p>

<p>The grounds are nobly situated; being very high and commanding
a wide prospect of land and river. They are tastefully laid out
in broad terraces, with winding roads and paths; and there is
profuse adornment in the way of semi-tropical shrubs and
flowers,' and in one part is a piece of native wild-wood, left
just as it grew, and, therefore, perfect in its charm. Everything
about this cemetery suggests the hand of the national Government.
The Government's work is always conspicuous for excellence,
solidity, thoroughness, neatness. The Government does its work
well in the first place, and then takes care of it.</p>

<p>By winding-roads&mdash;which were often cut to so great a depth
between perpendicular walls that they were mere roofless
tunnels&mdash;we drove out a mile or two and visited the monument
which stands upon the scene of the surrender of Vicksburg to
General Grant by General Pemberton. Its metal will preserve it
from the hackings and chippings which so defaced its predecessor,
which was of marble; but the brick foundations are crumbling, and
it will tumble down by-and-bye. It overlooks a picturesque region
of wooded hills and ravines; and is not unpicturesque itself,
being well smothered in flowering weeds. The battered remnant of
the marble monument has been removed to the National
Cemetery.</p>

<p>On the road, a quarter of a mile townward, an aged colored man
showed us, with pride, an unexploded bomb-shell which has lain in
his yard since the day it fell there during the siege.</p>

<p>'I was a-stannin' heah, an' de dog was a-stannin' heah; de dog
he went for de shell, gwine to pick a fuss wid it; but I didn't;
I says, "Jes' make you'seff at home heah; lay still whah you is,
or bust up de place, jes' as you's a mind to, but I's got
business out in de woods, I has!"'</p>

<p>Vicksburg is a town of substantial business streets and
pleasant residences; it commands the commerce of the Yazoo and
Sunflower Rivers; is pushing railways in several directions,
through rich agricultural regions, and has a promising future of
prosperity and importance.</p>

<p>Apparently, nearly all the river towns, big and little, have
made up their minds that they must look mainly to railroads for
wealth and upbuilding, henceforth. They are acting upon this
idea. The signs are, that the next twenty years will bring about
some noteworthy changes in the Valley, in the direction of
increased population and wealth, and in the intellectual
advancement and the liberalizing of opinion which go naturally
with these. And yet, if one may judge by the past, the river
towns will manage to find and use a chance, here and there, to
cripple and retard their progress. They kept themselves back in
the days of steamboating supremacy, by a system of wharfage-dues
so stupidly graded as to prohibit what may be called small RETAIL
traffic in freights and passengers. Boats were charged such heavy
wharfage that they could not afford to land for one or two
passengers or a light lot of freight. Instead of encouraging the
bringing of trade to their doors, the towns diligently and
effectively discouraged it. They could have had many boats and
low rates; but their policy rendered few boats and high rates
compulsory. It was a policy which extended&mdash;and extends&mdash;from New
Orleans to St. Paul.</p>

<p>We had a strong desire to make a trip up the Yazoo and the
Sunflower&mdash;an interesting region at any time, but additionally
interesting at this time, because up there the great inundation
was still to be seen in force&mdash;but we were nearly sure to have to
wait a day or more for a New Orleans boat on our return; so we
were obliged to give up the project.</p>

<p>Here is a story which I picked up on board the boat that
night. I insert it in this place merely because it is a good
story, not because it belongs here&mdash;for it doesn't. It was told
by a passenger&mdash;a college professor&mdash;and was called to the
surface in the course of a general conversation which began with
talk about horses, drifted into talk about astronomy, then into
talk about the lynching of the gamblers in Vicksburg half a
century ago, then into talk about dreams and superstitions; and
ended, after midnight, in a dispute over free trade and
protection.</p>
