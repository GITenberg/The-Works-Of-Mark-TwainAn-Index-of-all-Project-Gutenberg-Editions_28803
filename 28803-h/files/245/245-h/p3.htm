<h3>The River Rises</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>DURING this big rise these small-fry craft were an intolerable
nuisance. We were running chute after chute,&mdash;a new world to
me,&mdash;and if there was a particularly cramped place in a chute, we
would be pretty sure to meet a broad-horn there; and if he failed
to be there, we would find him in a still worse locality, namely,
the head of the chute, on the shoal water. And then there would
be no end of profane cordialities exchanged.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the big river, when we would be feeling our way
cautiously along through a fog, the deep hush would suddenly be
broken by yells and a clamor of tin pans, and all in instant a
log raft would appear vaguely through the webby veil, close upon
us; and then we did not wait to swap knives, but snatched our
engine bells out by the roots and piled on all the steam we had,
to scramble out of the way! One doesn't hit a rock or a solid log
craft with a steamboat when he can get excused.</p>

<p>You will hardly believe it, but many steamboat clerks always
carried a large assortment of religious tracts with them in those
old departed steamboating days. Indeed they did. Twenty times a
day we would be cramping up around a bar, while a string of these
small-fry rascals were drifting down into the head of the bend
away above and beyond us a couple of miles. Now a skiff would
dart away from one of them, and come fighting its laborious way
across the desert of water. It would 'ease all,' in the shadow of
our forecastle, and the panting oarsmen would shout, 'Gimme a
pa-a-per!' as the skiff drifted swiftly astern. The clerk would
throw over a file of New Orleans journals. If these were picked
up without comment, you might notice that now a dozen other
skiffs had been drifting down upon us without saying anything.
You understand, they had been waiting to see how No. 1 was going
to fare. No. 1 making no comment, all the rest would bend to
their oars and come on, now; and as fast as they came the clerk
would heave over neat bundles of religious tracts, tied to
shingles. The amount of hard swearing which twelve packages of
religious literature will command when impartially divided up
among twelve raftsmen's crews, who have pulled a heavy skiff two
miles on a hot day to get them, is simply incredible.</p>

<p>As I have said, the big rise brought a new world under my
vision. By the time the river was over its banks we had forsaken
our old paths and were hourly climbing over bars that had stood
ten feet out of water before; we were shaving stumpy shores, like
that at the foot of Madrid Bend, which I had always seen avoided
before; we were clattering through chutes like that of 82, where
the opening at the foot was an unbroken wall of timber till our
nose was almost at the very spot. Some of these chutes were utter
solitudes. The dense, untouched forest overhung both banks of the
crooked little crack, and one could believe that human creatures
had never intruded there before. The swinging grape-vines, the
grassy nooks and vistas glimpsed as we swept by, the flowering
creepers waving their red blossoms from the tops of dead trunks,
and all the spendthrift richness of the forest foliage, were
wasted and thrown away there. The chutes were lovely places to
steer in; they were deep, except at the head; the current was
gentle; under the 'points' the water was absolutely dead, and the
invisible banks so bluff that where the tender willow thickets
projected you could bury your boat's broadside in them as you
tore along, and then you seemed fairly to fly.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Behind other islands we found wretched little farms, and
wretcheder little log-cabins; there were crazy rail fences
sticking a foot or two above the water, with one or two
jeans-clad, chills-racked, yellow-faced male miserables roosting
on the top-rail, elbows on knees, jaws in hands, grinding tobacco
and discharging the result at floating chips through crevices
left by lost teeth; while the rest of the family and the few
farm-animals were huddled together in an empty wood-flat riding
at her moorings close at hand. In this flat-boat the family would
have to cook and eat and sleep for a lesser or greater number of
days (or possibly weeks), until the river should fall two or
three feet and let them get back to their log-cabin and their
chills again&mdash;chills being a merciful provision of an all-wise
Providence to enable them to take exercise without exertion. And
this sort of watery camping out was a thing which these people
were rather liable to be treated to a couple of times a year: by
the December rise out of the Ohio, and the June rise out of the
Mississippi. And yet these were kindly dispensations, for they at
least enabled the poor things to rise from the dead now and then,
and look upon life when a steamboat went by. They appreciated the
blessing, too, for they spread their mouths and eyes wide open
and made the most of these occasions. Now what COULD these
banished creatures find to do to keep from dying of the blues
during the low-water season!</p>

<p>Once, in one of these lovely island chutes, we found our
course completely bridged by a great fallen tree. This will serve
to show how narrow some of the chutes were. The passengers had an
hour's recreation in a virgin wilderness, while the boat-hands
chopped the bridge away; for there was no such thing as turning
back, you comprehend.</p>

<p>From Cairo to Baton Rouge, when the river is over its banks,
you have no particular trouble in the night, for the
thousand-mile wall of dense forest that guards the two banks all
the way is only gapped with a farm or wood-yard opening at
intervals, and so you can't 'get out of the river' much easier
than you could get out of a fenced lane; but from Baton Rouge to
New Orleans it is a different matter. The river is more than a
mile wide, and very deep&mdash;as much as two hundred feet, in places.
Both banks, for a good deal over a hundred miles, are shorn of
their timber and bordered by continuous sugar plantations, with
only here and there a scattering sapling or row of ornamental
China-trees. The timber is shorn off clear to the rear of the
plantations, from two to four miles. When the first frost
threatens to come, the planters snatch off their crops in a
hurry. When they have finished grinding the cane, they form the
refuse of the stalks (which they call BAGASSE) into great piles
and set fire to them, though in other sugar countries the bagasse
is used for fuel in the furnaces of the sugar mills. Now the
piles of damp bagasse burn slowly, and smoke like Satan's own
kitchen.</p>

<p>An embankment ten or fifteen feet high guards both banks of
the Mississippi all the way down that lower end of the river, and
this embankment is set back from the edge of the shore from ten
to perhaps a hundred feet, according to circumstances; say thirty
or forty feet, as a general thing. Fill that whole region with an
impenetrable gloom of smoke from a hundred miles of burning
bagasse piles, when the river is over the banks, and turn a
steamboat loose along there at midnight and see how she will
feel. And see how you will feel, too! You find yourself away out
in the midst of a vague dim sea that is shoreless, that fades out
and loses itself in the murky distances; for you cannot discern
the thin rib of embankment, and you are always imagining you see
a straggling tree when you don't. The plantations themselves are
transformed by the smoke, and look like a part of the sea. All
through your watch you are tortured with the exquisite misery of
uncertainty. You hope you are keeping in the river, but you do
not know. All that you are sure about is that you are likely to
be within six feet of the bank and destruction, when you think
you are a good half-mile from shore. And you are sure, also, that
if you chance suddenly to fetch up against the embankment and
topple your chimneys overboard, you will have the small comfort
of knowing that it is about what you were expecting to do. One of
the great Vicksburg packets darted out into a sugar plantation
one night, at such a time, and had to stay there a week. But
there was no novelty about it; it had often been done before.</p>

<p>I thought I had finished this chapter, but I wish to add a
curious thing, while it is in my mind. It is only relevant in
that it is connected with piloting. There used to be an excellent
pilot on the river, a Mr. X., who was a somnambulist. It was said
that if his mind was troubled about a bad piece of river, he was
pretty sure to get up and walk in his sleep and do strange
things. He was once fellow-pilot for a trip or two with George
Ealer, on a great New Orleans passenger packet. During a
considerable part of the first trip George was uneasy, but got
over it by and by, as X. seemed content to stay in his bed when
asleep. Late one night the boat was approaching Helena, Arkansas;
the water was low, and the crossing above the town in a very
blind and tangled condition. X. had seen the crossing since Ealer
had, and as the night was particularly drizzly, sullen, and dark,
Ealer was considering whether he had not better have X. called to
assist in running the place, when the door opened and X. walked
in. Now on very dark nights, light is a deadly enemy to piloting;
you are aware that if you stand in a lighted room, on such a
night, you cannot see things in the street to any purpose; but if
you put out the lights and stand in the gloom you can make out
objects in the street pretty well. So, on very dark nights,
pilots do not smoke; they allow no fire in the pilot-house stove
if there is a crack which can allow the least ray to escape; they
order the furnaces to be curtained with huge tarpaulins and the
sky-lights to be closely blinded. Then no light whatever issues
from the boat. The undefinable shape that now entered the
pilot-house had Mr. X.'s voice. This said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Let me take her, George; I've seen this place since you have,
and it is so crooked that I reckon I can run it myself easier
than I could tell you how to do it.'</p>

<a name="139"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="139.jpg (98K)" src="images/139.jpg" height="532" width="567">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>'It is kind of you, and I swear _I_ am willing. I haven't got
another drop of perspiration left in me. I have been spinning
around and around the wheel like a squirrel. It is so dark I
can't tell which way she is swinging till she is coming around
like a whirligig.'</p>

<p>So Ealer took a seat on the bench, panting and breathless. The
black phantom assumed the wheel without saying anything, steadied
the waltzing steamer with a turn or two, and then stood at ease,
coaxing her a little to this side and then to that, as gently and
as sweetly as if the time had been noonday. When Ealer observed
this marvel of steering, he wished he had not confessed! He
stared, and wondered, and finally said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, I thought I knew how to steer a steamboat, but that was
another mistake of mine.'</p>

<p>X. said nothing, but went serenely on with his work. He rang
for the leads; he rang to slow down the steam; he worked the boat
carefully and neatly into invisible marks, then stood at the
center of the wheel and peered blandly out into the blackness,
fore and aft, to verify his position; as the leads shoaled more
and more, he stopped the engines entirely, and the dead silence
and suspense of 'drifting' followed when the shoalest water was
struck, he cracked on the steam, carried her handsomely over, and
then began to work her warily into the next system of shoal
marks; the same patient, heedful use of leads and engines
followed, the boat slipped through without touching bottom, and
entered upon the third and last intricacy of the crossing;
imperceptibly she moved through the gloom, crept by inches into
her marks, drifted tediously till the shoalest water was cried,
and then, under a tremendous head of steam, went swinging over
the reef and away into deep water and safety!</p>

<p>Ealer let his long-pent breath pour out in a great, relieving
sigh, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'That's the sweetest piece of piloting that was ever done on
the Mississippi River! I wouldn't believed it could be done, if I
hadn't seen it.'</p>

<p>There was no reply, and he added&mdash;</p>

<p>'Just hold her five minutes longer, partner, and let me run
down and get a cup of coffee.'</p>

<p>A minute later Ealer was biting into a pie, down in the
'texas,' and comforting himself with coffee. Just then the night
watchman happened in, and was about to happen out again, when he
noticed Ealer and exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'Who is at the wheel, sir?'</p>

<p>'X.'</p>

<a name="140"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="140.jpg (86K)" src="images/140.jpg" height="697" width="324">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>'Dart for the pilot-house, quicker than lightning!'</p>

<p>The next moment both men were flying up the pilot-house
companion way, three steps at a jump! Nobody there! The great
steamer was whistling down the middle of the river at her own
sweet will! The watchman shot out of the place again; Ealer
seized the wheel, set an engine back with power, and held his
breath while the boat reluctantly swung away from a 'towhead'
which she was about to knock into the middle of the Gulf of
Mexico!</p>

<p>By and by the watchman came back and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Didn't that lunatic tell you he was asleep, when he first
came up here?'</p>

<p>'NO.'</p>

<p>'Well, he was. I found him walking along on top of the
railings just as unconcerned as another man would walk a
pavement; and I put him to bed; now just this minute there he was
again, away astern, going through that sort of tight-rope
deviltry the same as before.'</p>

<p>'Well, I think I'll stay by, next time he has one of those
fits. But I hope he'll have them often. You just ought to have
seen him take this boat through Helena crossing. I never saw
anything so gaudy before. And if he can do such gold-leaf,
kid-glove, diamond-breastpin piloting when he is sound asleep,
what COULDN'T he do if he was dead!'</p>

<center><h2>Chapter 12</h2>
<br>
<h3>Sounding</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>WHEN the river is very low, and one's steamboat is 'drawing
all the water' there is in the channel,&mdash;or a few inches more, as
was often the case in the old times,&mdash;one must be painfully
circumspect in his piloting. We used to have to 'sound' a number
of particularly bad places almost every trip when the river was
at a very low stage.</p>

<a name="143"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="143.jpg (63K)" src="images/143.jpg" height="475" width="554">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Sounding is done in this way. The boat ties up at the shore,
just above the shoal crossing; the pilot not on watch takes his
'cub' or steersman and a picked crew of men (sometimes an officer
also), and goes out in the yawl&mdash;provided the boat has not that
rare and sumptuous luxury, a regularly-devised
'sounding-boat'&mdash;and proceeds to hunt for the best water, the
pilot on duty watching his movements through a spy-glass,
meantime, and in some instances assisting by signals of the
boat's whistle, signifying 'try higher up' or 'try lower down;'
for the surface of the water, like an oil-painting, is more
expressive and intelligible when inspected from a little distance
than very close at hand. The whistle signals are seldom
necessary, however; never, perhaps, except when the wind confuses
the significant ripples upon the water's surface. When the yawl
has reached the shoal place, the speed is slackened, the pilot
begins to sound the depth with a pole ten or twelve feet long,
and the steersman at the tiller obeys the order to 'hold her up
to starboard;' or, 'let her fall off to larboard;'{footnote [The
term 'larboard' is never used at sea now, to signify the left
hand; but was always used on the river in my time]} or
'steady&mdash;steady as you go.'</p>

<p>When the measurements indicate that the yawl is approaching
the shoalest part of the reef, the command is given to 'ease
all!' Then the men stop rowing and the yawl drifts with the
current. The next order is, 'Stand by with the buoy!' The moment
the shallowest point is reached, the pilot delivers the order,
'Let go the buoy!' and over she goes. If the pilot is not
satisfied, he sounds the place again; if he finds better water
higher up or lower down, he removes the buoy to that place. Being
finally satisfied, he gives the order, and all the men stand
their oars straight up in the air, in line; a blast from the
boat's whistle indicates that the signal has been seen; then the
men 'give way' on their oars and lay the yawl alongside the buoy;
the steamer comes creeping carefully down, is pointed straight at
the buoy, husbands her power for the coming struggle, and
presently, at the critical moment, turns on all her steam and
goes grinding and wallowing over the buoy and the sand, and gains
the deep water beyond. Or maybe she doesn't; maybe she 'strikes
and swings.' Then she has to while away several hours (or days)
sparring herself off.</p>

<p>Sometimes a buoy is not laid at all, but the yawl goes ahead,
hunting the best water, and the steamer follows along in its
wake. Often there is a deal of fun and excitement about sounding,
especially if it is a glorious summer day, or a blustering night.
But in winter the cold and the peril take most of the fun out of
it.</p>

<p>A buoy is nothing but a board four or five feet long, with one
end turned up; it is a reversed school-house bench, with one of
the supports left and the other removed. It is anchored on the
shoalest part of the reef by a rope with a heavy stone made fast
to the end of it. But for the resistance of the turned-up end of
the reversed bench, the current would pull the buoy under water.
At night, a paper lantern with a candle in it is fastened on top
of the buoy, and this can be seen a mile or more, a little
glimmering spark in the waste of blackness.</p>

<p>Nothing delights a cub so much as an opportunity to go out
sounding. There is such an air of adventure about it; often there
is danger; it is so gaudy and man-of-war-like to sit up in the
stern-sheets and steer a swift yawl; there is something fine
about the exultant spring of the boat when an experienced old
sailor crew throw their souls into the oars; it is lovely to see
the white foam stream away from the bows; there is music in the
rush of the water; it is deliciously exhilarating, in summer, to
go speeding over the breezy expanses of the river when the world
of wavelets is dancing in the sun. It is such grandeur, too, to
the cub, to get a chance to give an order; for often the pilot
will simply say, 'Let her go about!' and leave the rest to the
cub, who instantly cries, in his sternest tone of command, 'Ease
starboard! Strong on the larboard! Starboard give way! With a
will, men!' The cub enjoys sounding for the further reason that
the eyes of the passengers are watching all the yawl's movements
with absorbing interest if the time be daylight; and if it be
night he knows that those same wondering eyes are fastened upon
the yawl's lantern as it glides out into the gloom and dims away
in the remote distance.</p>

<p>One trip a pretty girl of sixteen spent her time in our
pilot-house with her uncle and aunt, every day and all day long.
I fell in love with her. So did Mr. Thornburg's cub, Tom G&mdash;&mdash;.
Tom and I had been bosom friends until this time; but now a
coolness began to arise. I told the girl a good many of my river
adventures, and made myself out a good deal of a hero; Tom tried
to make himself appear to be a hero, too, and succeeded to some
extent, but then he always had a way of embroidering. However,
virtue is its own reward, so I was a barely perceptible trifle
ahead in the contest. About this time something happened which
promised handsomely for me: the pilots decided to sound the
crossing at the head of 21. This would occur about nine or ten
o'clock at night, when the passengers would be still up; it would
be Mr. Thornburg's watch, therefore my chief would have to do the
sounding. We had a perfect love of a sounding-boat&mdash;long, trim,
graceful, and as fleet as a greyhound; her thwarts were
cushioned; she carried twelve oarsmen; one of the mates was
always sent in her to transmit orders to her crew, for ours was a
steamer where no end of 'style' was put on.</p>

<p>We tied up at the shore above 21, and got ready. It was a foul
night, and the river was so wide, there, that a landsman's
uneducated eyes could discern no opposite shore through such a
gloom. The passengers were alert and interested; everything was
satisfactory. As I hurried through the engine-room, picturesquely
gotten up in storm toggery, I met Tom, and could not forbear
delivering myself of a mean speech&mdash;</p>

<p>'Ain't you glad YOU don't have to go out sounding?'</p>

<p>Tom was passing on, but he quickly turned, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Now just for that, you can go and get the sounding-pole
yourself. I was going after it, but I'd see you in Halifax, now,
before I'd do it.'</p>

<p>'Who wants you to get it? I don't. It's in the
sounding-boat.'</p>

<p>'It ain't, either. It's been new-painted; and it's been up on
the ladies' cabin guards two days, drying.'</p>

<p>I flew back, and shortly arrived among the crowd of watching
and wondering ladies just in time to hear the command:</p>

<p>'Give way, men!'</p>

<p>I looked over, and there was the gallant sounding-boat booming
away, the unprincipled Tom presiding at the tiller, and my chief
sitting by him with the sounding-pole which I had been sent on a
fool's errand to fetch. Then that young girl said to me&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, how awful to have to go out in that little boat on such a
night! Do you think there is any danger?'</p>

<p>I would rather have been stabbed. I went off, full of venom,
to help in the pilot-house. By and by the boat's lantern
disappeared, and after an interval a wee spark glimmered upon the
face of the water a mile away. Mr. Thornburg blew the whistle, in
acknowledgment, backed the steamer out, and made for it. We flew
along for a while, then slackened steam and went cautiously
gliding toward the spark. Presently Mr. Thornburg exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'Hello, the buoy-lantern's out!'</p>

<p>He stopped the engines. A moment or two later he said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Why, there it is again!'</p>

<p>So he came ahead on the engines once more, and rang for the
leads. Gradually the water shoaled up, and then began to deepen
again! Mr. Thornburg muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, I don't understand this. I believe that buoy has
drifted off the reef. Seems to be a little too far to the left.
No matter, it is safest to run over it anyhow.'</p>

<p>So, in that solid world of darkness we went creeping down on
the light. Just as our bows were in the act of plowing over it,
Mr. Thornburg seized the bell-ropes, rang a startling peal, and
exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'My soul, it's the sounding-boat!'</p>

<p>A sudden chorus of wild alarms burst out far below&mdash;a
pause&mdash;and then the sound of grinding and crashing followed. Mr.
Thornburg exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>'There! the paddle-wheel has ground the sounding-boat to
lucifer matches! Run! See who is killed!'</p>

<p>I was on the main deck in the twinkling of an eye. My chief
and the third mate and nearly all the men were safe. They had
discovered their danger when it was too late to pull out of the
way; then, when the great guards overshadowed them a moment
later, they were prepared and knew what to do; at my chiefs order
they sprang at the right instant, seized the guard, and were
hauled aboard. The next moment the sounding-yawl swept aft to the
wheel and was struck and splintered to atoms. Two of the men and
the cub Tom, were missing&mdash;a fact which spread like wildfire over
the boat. The passengers came flocking to the forward gangway,
ladies and all, anxious-eyed, white-faced, and talked in awed
voices of the dreadful thing. And often and again I heard them
say, 'Poor fellows! poor boy, poor boy!'</p>

<p>By this time the boat's yawl was manned and away, to search
for the missing. Now a faint call was heard, off to the left. The
yawl had disappeared in the other direction. Half the people
rushed to one side to encourage the swimmer with their shouts;
the other half rushed the other way to shriek to the yawl to turn
about. By the callings, the swimmer was approaching, but some
said the sound showed failing strength. The crowd massed
themselves against the boiler-deck railings, leaning over and
staring into the gloom; and every faint and fainter cry wrung
from them such words as, 'Ah, poor fellow, poor fellow! is there
no way to save him?'</p>

<p>But still the cries held out, and drew nearer, and presently
the voice said pluckily&mdash;</p>

<p>'I can make it! Stand by with a rope!'</p>

<p>What a rousing cheer they gave him! The chief mate took his
stand in the glare of a torch-basket, a coil of rope in his hand,
and his men grouped about him. The next moment the swimmer's face
appeared in the circle of light, and in another one the owner of
it was hauled aboard, limp and drenched, while cheer on cheer
went up. It was that devil Tom.</p>

<img alt="150.jpg (120K)" src="images/150.jpg" height="620" width="506">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The yawl crew searched everywhere, but found no sign of the
two men. They probably failed to catch the guard, tumbled back,
and were struck by the wheel and killed. Tom had never jumped for
the guard at all, but had plunged head-first into the river and
dived under the wheel. It was nothing; I could have done it easy
enough, and I said so; but everybody went on just the same,
making a wonderful to do over that ass, as if he had done
something great. That girl couldn't seem to have enough of that
pitiful 'hero' the rest of the trip; but little I cared; I
loathed her, any way.</p>

<p>The way we came to mistake the sounding-boat's lantern for the
buoy-light was this. My chief said that after laying the buoy he
fell away and watched it till it seemed to be secure; then he
took up a position a hundred yards below it and a little to one
side of the steamer's course, headed the sounding-boat up-stream,
and waited. Having to wait some time, he and the officer got to
talking; he looked up when he judged that the steamer was about
on the reef; saw that the buoy was gone, but supposed that the
steamer had already run over it; he went on with his talk; he
noticed that the steamer was getting very close on him, but that
was the correct thing; it was her business to shave him closely,
for convenience in taking him aboard; he was expecting her to
sheer off, until the last moment; then it flashed upon him that
she was trying to run him down, mistaking his lantern for the
buoy-light; so he sang out, 'Stand by to spring for the guard,
men!' and the next instant the jump was made.</p>

<br>
<h3>A Pilot's Needs</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>BUT I am wandering from what I was intending to do, that is,
make plainer than perhaps appears in the previous chapters, some
of the peculiar requirements of the science of piloting. First of
all, there is one faculty which a pilot must incessantly
cultivate until he has brought it to absolute perfection. Nothing
short of perfection will do. That faculty is memory. He cannot
stop with merely thinking a thing is so and so; he must know it;
for this is eminently one of the 'exact' sciences. With what
scorn a pilot was looked upon, in the old times, if he ever
ventured to deal in that feeble phrase 'I think,' instead of the
vigorous one 'I know!' One cannot easily realize what a
tremendous thing it is to know every trivial detail of twelve
hundred miles of river and know it with absolute exactness. If
you will take the longest street in New York, and travel up and
down it, conning its features patiently until you know every
house and window and door and lamp-post and big and little sign
by heart, and know them so accurately that you can instantly name
the one you are abreast of when you are set down at random in
that street in the middle of an inky black night, you will then
have a tolerable notion of the amount and the exactness of a
pilot's knowledge who carries the Mississippi River in his head.
And then if you will go on until you know every street crossing,
the character, size, and position of the crossing-stones, and the
varying depth of mud in each of those numberless places, you will
have some idea of what the pilot must know in order to keep a
Mississippi steamer out of trouble. Next, if you will take half
of the signs in that long street, and CHANGE THEIR PLACES once a
month, and still manage to know their new positions accurately on
dark nights, and keep up with these repeated changes without
making any mistakes, you will understand what is required of a
pilot's peerless memory by the fickle Mississippi.</p>

<a name="153"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="153.jpg (105K)" src="images/153.jpg" height="876" width="349">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>I think a pilot's memory is about the most wonderful thing in
the world. To know the Old and New Testaments by heart, and be
able to recite them glibly, forward or backward, or begin at
random anywhere in the book and recite both ways and never trip
or make a mistake, is no extravagant mass of knowledge, and no
marvelous facility, compared to a pilot's massed knowledge of the
Mississippi and his marvelous facility in the handling of it. I
make this comparison deliberately, and believe I am not expanding
the truth when I do it. Many will think my figure too strong, but
pilots will not.</p>

<p>And how easily and comfortably the pilot's memory does its
work; how placidly effortless is its way; how UNCONSCIOUSLY it
lays up its vast stores, hour by hour, day by day, and never
loses or mislays a single valuable package of them all! Take an
instance. Let a leadsman cry, 'Half twain! half twain! half
twain! half twain! half twain!' until it become as monotonous as
the ticking of a clock; let conversation be going on all the
time, and the pilot be doing his share of the talking, and no
longer consciously listening to the leadsman; and in the midst of
this endless string of half twains let a single 'quarter twain!'
be interjected, without emphasis, and then the half twain cry go
on again, just as before: two or three weeks later that pilot can
describe with precision the boat's position in the river when
that quarter twain was uttered, and give you such a lot of
head-marks, stern-marks, and side-marks to guide you, that you
ought to be able to take the boat there and put her in that same
spot again yourself! The cry of 'quarter twain' did not really
take his mind from his talk, but his trained faculties instantly
photographed the bearings, noted the change of depth, and laid up
the important details for future reference without requiring any
assistance from him in the matter. If you were walking and
talking with a friend, and another friend at your side kept up a
monotonous repetition of the vowel sound A, for a couple of
blocks, and then in the midst interjected an R, thus, A, A, A, A,
A, R, A, A, A, etc., and gave the R no emphasis, you would not be
able to state, two or three weeks afterward, that the R had been
put in, nor be able to tell what objects you were passing at the
moment it was done. But you could if your memory had been
patiently and laboriously trained to do that sort of thing
mechanically.</p>

<br><br>

<p>Give a man a tolerably fair memory to start with, and piloting
will develop it into a very colossus of capability. But ONLY IN
THE MATTERS IT IS DAILY DRILLED IN. A time would come when the
man's faculties could not help noticing landmarks and soundings,
and his memory could not help holding on to them with the grip of
a vise; but if you asked that same man at noon what he had had
for breakfast, it would be ten chances to one that he could not
tell you. Astonishing things can be done with the human memory if
you will devote it faithfully to one particular line of
business.</p>

<p>At the time that wages soared so high on the Missouri River,
my chief, Mr. Bixby, went up there and learned more than a
thousand miles of that stream with an ease and rapidity that were
astonishing. When he had seen each division once in the daytime
and once at night, his education was so nearly complete that he
took out a 'daylight' license; a few trips later he took out a
full license, and went to piloting day and night&mdash;and he ranked
A 1, too.</p>

<p>Mr. Bixby placed me as steersman for a while under a pilot
whose feats of memory were a constant marvel to me. However, his
memory was born in him, I think, not built. For instance,
somebody would mention a name. Instantly Mr. Brown would break
in&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, I knew HIM. Sallow-faced, red-headed fellow, with a
little scar on the side of his throat, like a splinter under the
flesh. He was only in the Southern trade six months. That was
thirteen years ago. I made a trip with him. There was five feet
in the upper river then; the "Henry Blake" grounded at the foot
of Tower Island drawing four and a half; the "George Elliott"
unshipped her rudder on the wreck of the "Sunflower"&mdash;'</p>

<a name="156"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="156.jpg (42K)" src="images/156.jpg" height="510" width="342">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>'Why, the "Sunflower" didn't sink until&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I know when she sunk; it was three years before that, on the
2nd of December; Asa Hardy was captain of her, and his brother
John was first clerk; and it was his first trip in her, too; Tom
Jones told me these things a week afterward in New Orleans; he
was first mate of the "Sunflower." Captain Hardy stuck a nail in
his foot the 6th of July of the next year, and died of the
lockjaw on the 15th. His brother died two years after 3rd of
March,&mdash;erysipelas. I never saw either of the Hardys,&mdash;they were
Alleghany River men,&mdash;but people who knew them told me all these
things. And they said Captain Hardy wore yarn socks winter and
summer just the same, and his first wife's name was Jane
Shook&mdash;she was from New England&mdash;and his second one died in a
lunatic asylum. It was in the blood. She was from Lexington,
Kentucky. Name was Horton before she was married.'</p>

<p>And so on, by the hour, the man's tongue would go. He could
NOT forget any thing. It was simply impossible. The most trivial
details remained as distinct and luminous in his head, after they
had lain there for years, as the most memorable events. His was
not simply a pilot's memory; its grasp was universal. If he were
talking about a trifling letter he had received seven years
before, he was pretty sure to deliver you the entire screed from
memory. And then without observing that he was departing from the
true line of his talk, he was more than likely to hurl in a
long-drawn parenthetical biography of the writer of that letter;
and you were lucky indeed if he did not take up that writer's
relatives, one by one, and give you their biographies, too.</p>

<p>Such a memory as that is a great misfortune. To it, all
occurrences are of the same size. Its possessor cannot
distinguish an interesting circumstance from an uninteresting
one. As a talker, he is bound to clog his narrative with tiresome
details and make himself an insufferable bore. Moreover, he
cannot stick to his subject. He picks up every little grain of
memory he discerns in his way, and so is led aside. Mr. Brown
would start out with the honest intention of telling you a vastly
funny anecdote about a dog. He would be 'so full of laugh' that
he could hardly begin; then his memory would start with the dog's
breed and personal appearance; drift into a history of his owner;
of his owner's family, with descriptions of weddings and burials
that had occurred in it, together with recitals of congratulatory
verses and obituary poetry provoked by the same: then this memory
would recollect that one of these events occurred during the
celebrated 'hard winter' of such and such a year, and a minute
description of that winter would follow, along with the names of
people who were frozen to death, and statistics showing the high
figures which pork and hay went up to. Pork and hay would suggest
corn and fodder; corn and fodder would suggest cows and horses;
cows and horses would suggest the circus and certain celebrated
bare-back riders; the transition from the circus to the menagerie
was easy and natural; from the elephant to equatorial Africa was
but a step; then of course the heathen savages would suggest
religion; and at the end of three or four hours' tedious jaw, the
watch would change, and Brown would go out of the pilot-house
muttering extracts from sermons he had heard years before about
the efficacy of prayer as a means of grace. And the original
first mention would be all you had learned about that dog, after
all this waiting and hungering.</p>

<br><br>

<p>A pilot must have a memory; but there are two higher qualities
which he must also have. He must have good and quick judgment and
decision, and a cool, calm courage that no peril can shake. Give
a man the merest trifle of pluck to start with, and by the time
he has become a pilot he cannot be unmanned by any danger a
steamboat can get into; but one cannot quite say the same for
judgment. Judgment is a matter of brains, and a man must START
with a good stock of that article or he will never succeed as a
pilot.</p>

<p>The growth of courage in the pilot-house is steady all the
time, but it does not reach a high and satisfactory condition
until some time after the young pilot has been 'standing his own
watch,' alone and under the staggering weight of all the
responsibilities connected with the position. When an apprentice
has become pretty thoroughly acquainted with the river, he goes
clattering along so fearlessly with his steamboat, night or day,
that he presently begins to imagine that it is HIS courage that
animates him; but the first time the pilot steps out and leaves
him to his own devices he finds out it was the other man's. He
discovers that the article has been left out of his own cargo
altogether. The whole river is bristling with exigencies in a
moment; he is not prepared for them; he does not know how to meet
them; all his knowledge forsakes him; and within fifteen minutes
he is as white as a sheet and scared almost to death. Therefore
pilots wisely train these cubs by various strategic tricks to
look danger in the face a little more calmly. A favorite way of
theirs is to play a friendly swindle upon the candidate.</p>

<p>Mr. Bixby served me in this fashion once, and for years
afterward I used to blush even in my sleep when I thought of it.
I had become a good steersman; so good, indeed, that I had all
the work to do on our watch, night and day; Mr. Bixby seldom made
a suggestion to me; all he ever did was to take the wheel on
particularly bad nights or in particularly bad crossings, land
the boat when she needed to be landed, play gentleman of leisure
nine-tenths of the watch, and collect the wages. The lower river
was about bank-full, and if anybody had questioned my ability to
run any crossing between Cairo and New Orleans without help or
instruction, I should have felt irreparably hurt. The idea of
being afraid of any crossing in the lot, in the DAY-TIME, was a
thing too preposterous for contemplation. Well, one matchless
summer's day I was bowling down the bend above island 66, brimful
of self-conceit and carrying my nose as high as a giraffe's, when
Mr. Bixby said&mdash;</p>

<p>'I am going below a while. I suppose you know the next
crossing?'</p>

<p>This was almost an affront. It was about the plainest and
simplest crossing in the whole river. One couldn't come to any
harm, whether he ran it right or not; and as for depth, there
never had been any bottom there. I knew all this, perfectly
well.</p>

<p>'Know how to RUN it? Why, I can run it with my eyes shut.'</p>

<p>'How much water is there in it?'</p>

<p>'Well, that is an odd question. I couldn't get bottom there
with a church steeple.'</p>

<p>'You think so, do you?'</p>

<p>The very tone of the question shook my confidence. That was
what Mr. Bixby was expecting. He left, without saying anything
more. I began to imagine all sorts of things. Mr. Bixby, unknown
to me, of course, sent somebody down to the forecastle with some
mysterious instructions to the leadsmen, another messenger was
sent to whisper among the officers, and then Mr. Bixby went into
hiding behind a smoke-stack where he could observe results.
Presently the captain stepped out on the hurricane deck; next the
chief mate appeared; then a clerk. Every moment or two a
straggler was added to my audience; and before I got to the head
of the island I had fifteen or twenty people assembled down there
under my nose. I began to wonder what the trouble was. As I
started across, the captain glanced aloft at me and said, with a
sham uneasiness in his voice&mdash;</p>

<p>'Where is Mr. Bixby?'</p>

<p>'Gone below, sir.'</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>But that did the business for me. My imagination began to
construct dangers out of nothing, and they multiplied faster than
I could keep the run of them. All at once I imagined I saw shoal
water ahead! The wave of coward agony that surged through me then
came near dislocating every joint in me. All my confidence in
that crossing vanished. I seized the bell-rope; dropped it,
ashamed; seized it again; dropped it once more; clutched it
tremblingly one again, and pulled it so feebly that I could
hardly hear the stroke myself. Captain and mate sang out
instantly, and both together&mdash;</p>

<p>'Starboard lead there! and quick about it!'</p>

<p>This was another shock. I began to climb the wheel like a
squirrel; but I would hardly get the boat started to port before
I would see new dangers on that side, and away I would spin to
the other; only to find perils accumulating to starboard, and be
crazy to get to port again. Then came the leadsman's sepulchral
cry&mdash;</p>

<p>'D-e-e-p four!'</p>

<p>Deep four in a bottomless crossing! The terror of it took my
breath away.</p>

<p>'M-a-r-k three!... M-a-r-k three... Quarter less three!...
Half twain!'</p>

<p>This was frightful! I seized the bell-ropes and stopped the
engines.</p>

<p>'Quarter twain! Quarter twain! MARK twain!'</p>

<p>I was helpless. I did not know what in the world to do. I was
quaking from head to foot, and I could have hung my hat on my
eyes, they stuck out so far.</p>

<p>'Quarter LESS twain! Nine and a HALF!'</p>

<p>We were DRAWING nine! My hands were in a nerveless flutter. I
could not ring a bell intelligibly with them. I flew to the
speaking-tube and shouted to the engineer&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh, Ben, if you love me, BACK her! Quick, Ben! Oh, back the
immortal SOUL out of her!'</p>

<a name="164"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="164.jpg (108K)" src="images/164.jpg" height="737" width="590">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>I heard the door close gently. I looked around, and there
stood Mr. Bixby, smiling a bland, sweet smile. Then the audience
on the hurricane deck sent up a thundergust of humiliating
laughter. I saw it all, now, and I felt meaner than the meanest
man in human history. I laid in the lead, set the boat in her
marks, came ahead on the engines, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'It was a fine trick to play on an orphan, WASN'T it? I
suppose I'll never hear the last of how I was ass enough to heave
the lead at the head of 66.'</p>

<p>'Well, no, you won't, maybe. In fact I hope you won't; for I
want you to learn something by that experience. Didn't you KNOW
there was no bottom in that crossing?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir, I did.'</p>

<p>'Very well, then. You shouldn't have allowed me or anybody
else to shake your confidence in that knowledge. Try to remember
that. And another thing: when you get into a dangerous place,
don't turn coward. That isn't going to help matters any.'</p>

<p>It was a good enough lesson, but pretty hardly learned. Yet
about the hardest part of it was that for months I so often had
to hear a phrase which I had conceived a particular distaste for.
It was, 'Oh, Ben, if you love me, back her!'</p>

<br>
<h3>Rank and Dignity of Piloting</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>IN my preceding chapters I have tried, by going into the
minutiae of the science of piloting, to carry the reader step by
step to a comprehension of what the science consists of; and at
the same time I have tried to show him that it is a very curious
and wonderful science, too, and very worthy of his attention. If
I have seemed to love my subject, it is no surprising thing, for
I loved the profession far better than any I have followed since,
and I took a measureless pride in it. The reason is plain: a
pilot, in those days, was the only unfettered and entirely
independent human being that lived in the earth. Kings are but
the hampered servants of parliament and people; parliaments sit
in chains forged by their constituency; the editor of a newspaper
cannot be independent, but must work with one hand tied behind
him by party and patrons, and be content to utter only half or
two-thirds of his mind; no clergyman is a free man and may speak
the whole truth, regardless of his parish's opinions; writers of
all kinds are manacled servants of the public. We write frankly
and fearlessly, but then we 'modify' before we print. In truth,
every man and woman and child has a master, and worries and frets
in servitude; but in the day I write of, the Mississippi pilot
had none. The captain could stand upon the hurricane deck, in the
pomp of a very brief authority, and give him five or six orders
while the vessel backed into the stream, and then that skipper's
reign was over.

<p>
The moment that the boat was under way in the
river, she was under the sole and unquestioned control of the
pilot. He could do with her exactly as he pleased, run her when
and whither he chose, and tie her up to the bank whenever his
judgment said that that course was best. His movements were
entirely free; he consulted no one, he received commands from
nobody, he promptly resented even the merest suggestions. Indeed,
the law of the United States forbade him to listen to commands or
suggestions, rightly considering that the pilot necessarily knew
better how to handle the boat than anybody could tell him. So
here was the novelty of a king without a keeper, an absolute
monarch who was absolute in sober truth and not by a fiction of
words. I have seen a boy of eighteen taking a great steamer
serenely into what seemed almost certain destruction, and the
aged captain standing mutely by, filled with apprehension but
powerless to interfere. His interference, in that particular
instance, might have been an excellent thing, but to permit it
would have been to establish a most pernicious precedent. It will
easily be guessed, considering the pilot's boundless authority,
that he was a great personage in the old steamboating days. He
was treated with marked courtesy by the captain and with marked
deference by all the officers and servants; and this deferential
spirit was quickly communicated to the passengers, too. I think
pilots were about the only people I ever knew who failed to show,
in some degree, embarrassment in the presence of traveling
foreign princes. But then, people in one's own grade of life are
not usually embarrassing objects.</p>

<p>By long habit, pilots came to put all their wishes in the form
of commands. It 'gravels' me, to this day, to put my will in the
weak shape of a request, instead of launching it in the crisp
language of an order. In those old days, to load a steamboat at
St. Louis, take her to New Orleans and back, and discharge cargo,
consumed about twenty-five days, on an average. Seven or eight of
these days the boat spent at the wharves of St. Louis and New
Orleans, and every soul on board was hard at work, except the two
pilots; they did nothing but play gentleman up town, and receive
the same wages for it as if they had been on duty. The moment the
boat touched the wharf at either city, they were ashore; and they
were not likely to be seen again till the last bell was ringing
and everything in readiness for another voyage.</p>

<p>When a captain got hold of a pilot of particularly high
reputation, he took pains to keep him. When wages were four
hundred dollars a month on the Upper Mississippi, I have known a
captain to keep such a pilot in idleness, under full pay, three
months at a time, while the river was frozen up. And one must
remember that in those cheap times four hundred dollars was a
salary of almost inconceivable splendor. Few men on shore got
such pay as that, and when they did they were mightily looked up
to. When pilots from either end of the river wandered into our
small Missouri village, they were sought by the best and the
fairest, and treated with exalted respect. Lying in port under
wages was a thing which many pilots greatly enjoyed and
appreciated; especially if they belonged in the Missouri River in
the heyday of that trade (Kansas times), and got nine hundred
dollars a trip, which was equivalent to about eighteen hundred
dollars a month. Here is a conversation of that day. A chap out
of the Illinois River, with a little stern-wheel tub, accosts a
couple of ornate and gilded Missouri River pilots&mdash;</p>

<p>'Gentlemen, I've got a pretty good trip for the upcountry, and
shall want you about a month. How much will it be?'</p>

<p>'Eighteen hundred dollars apiece.'</p>

<p>'Heavens and earth! You take my boat, let me have your wages,
and I'll divide!'</p>

<p>I will remark, in passing, that Mississippi steamboatmen were
important in landsmen's eyes (and in their own, too, in a degree)
according to the dignity of the boat they were on. For instance,
it was a proud thing to be of the crew of such stately craft as
the 'Aleck Scott' or the 'Grand Turk.' Negro firemen, deck hands,
and barbers belonging to those boats were distinguished
personages in their grade of life, and they were well aware of
that fact too. A stalwart darkey once gave offense at a negro
ball in New Orleans by putting on a good many airs. Finally one
of the managers bustled up to him and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Who IS you, any way? Who is you? dat's what I wants to
know!'</p>

<p>The offender was not disconcerted in the least, but swelled
himself up and threw that into his voice which showed that he
knew he was not putting on all those airs on a stinted
capital.</p>

<p>'Who IS I? Who IS I? I let you know mighty quick who I is! I
want you niggers to understan' dat I fires de middle do'{footnote
[Door]} on de "Aleck Scott!"'</p>

<p>That was sufficient.</p>

<p>The barber of the 'Grand Turk' was a spruce young negro, who
aired his importance with balmy complacency, and was greatly
courted by the circle in which he moved. The young colored
population of New Orleans were much given to flirting, at
twilight, on the banquettes of the back streets. Somebody saw and
heard something like the following, one evening, in one of those
localities. A middle-aged negro woman projected her head through
a broken pane and shouted (very willing that the neighbors should
hear and envy), 'You Mary Ann, come in de house dis minute!
Stannin' out dah foolin' 'long wid dat low trash, an' heah's de
barber offn de "Gran' Turk" wants to conwerse wid you!'</p>

<p>My reference, a moment ago, to the fact that a pilot's
peculiar official position placed him out of the reach of
criticism or command, brings Stephen W&mdash;&mdash; naturally to my mind.
He was a gifted pilot, a good fellow, a tireless talker, and had
both wit and humor in him. He had a most irreverent independence,
too, and was deliciously easy-going and comfortable in the
presence of age, official dignity, and even the most august
wealth. He always had work, he never saved a penny, he was a most
persuasive borrower, he was in debt to every pilot on the river,
and to the majority of the captains. He could throw a sort of
splendor around a bit of harum-scarum, devil-may-care piloting,
that made it almost fascinating&mdash;but not to everybody. He made a
trip with good old Captain Y&mdash;&mdash;once, and was 'relieved' from
duty when the boat got to New Orleans. Somebody expressed
surprise at the discharge. Captain Y&mdash;&mdash; shuddered at the mere
mention of Stephen. Then his poor, thin old voice piped out
something like this:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Why, bless me! I wouldn't have such a wild creature on my
boat for the world&mdash;not for the whole world! He swears, he sings,
he whistles, he yells&mdash;I never saw such an Injun to yell. All
times of the night&mdash;it never made any difference to him. He would
just yell that way, not for anything in particular, but merely on
account of a kind of devilish comfort he got out of it. I never
could get into a sound sleep but he would fetch me out of bed,
all in a cold sweat, with one of those dreadful war-whoops. A
queer being&mdash;very queer being; no respect for anything or
anybody. Sometimes he called me "Johnny." And he kept a fiddle,
and a cat. He played execrably. This seemed to distress the cat,
and so the cat would howl. Nobody could sleep where that man&mdash;and
his family&mdash;was. And reckless. There never was anything like it.
Now you may believe it or not, but as sure as I am sitting here,
he brought my boat a-tilting down through those awful snags at
Chicot under a rattling head of steam, and the wind a-blowing
like the very nation, at that! My officers will tell you so. They
saw it. And, sir, while he was a-tearing right down through those
snags, and I a-shaking in my shoes and praying, I wish I may
never speak again if he didn't pucker up his mouth and go to
WHISTLING! Yes, sir; whistling "Buffalo gals, can't you come out
tonight, can't you come out to-night, can't you come out
to-night;" and doing it as calmly as if we were attending a
funeral and weren't related to the corpse. And when I
remonstrated with him about it, he smiled down on me as if I was
his child, and told me to run in the house and try to be good,
and not be meddling with my superiors!'</p>

<p>Once a pretty mean captain caught Stephen in New Orleans out
of work and as usual out of money. He laid steady siege to
Stephen, who was in a very 'close place,' and finally persuaded
him to hire with him at one hundred and twenty-five dollars per
month, just half wages, the captain agreeing not to divulge the
secret and so bring down the contempt of all the guild upon the
poor fellow. But the boat was not more than a day out of New
Orleans before Stephen discovered that the captain was boasting
of his exploit, and that all the officers had been told. Stephen
winced, but said nothing. About the middle of the afternoon the
captain stepped out on the hurricane deck, cast his eye around,
and looked a good deal surprised. He glanced inquiringly aloft at
Stephen, but Stephen was whistling placidly, and attending to
business. The captain stood around a while in evident discomfort,
and once or twice seemed about to make a suggestion; but the
etiquette of the river taught him to avoid that sort of rashness,
and so he managed to hold his peace. He chafed and puzzled a few
minutes longer, then retired to his apartments. But soon he was
out again, and apparently more perplexed than ever. Presently he
ventured to remark, with deference&mdash;</p>

<p>'Pretty good stage of the river now, ain't it, sir?'</p>

<p>'Well, I should say so! Bank-full IS a pretty liberal
stage.'</p>

<p>'Seems to be a good deal of current here.'</p>

<p>'Good deal don't describe it! It's worse than a
mill-race.'</p>

<p>'Isn't it easier in toward shore than it is out here in the
middle?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I reckon it is; but a body can't be too careful with a
steamboat. It's pretty safe out here; can't strike any bottom
here, you can depend on that.'</p>

<p>The captain departed, looking rueful enough. At this rate, he
would probably die of old age before his boat got to St. Louis.
Next day he appeared on deck and again found Stephen faithfully
standing up the middle of the river, fighting the whole vast
force of the Mississippi, and whistling the same placid tune.
This thing was becoming serious. In by the shore was a slower
boat clipping along in the easy water and gaining steadily; she
began to make for an island chute; Stephen stuck to the middle of
the river. Speech was WRUNG from the captain. He said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, don't that chute cut off a good deal of
distance?'</p>

<p>'I think it does, but I don't know.'</p>

<p>'Don't know! Well, isn't there water enough in it now to go
through?'</p>

<p>'I expect there is, but I am not certain.'</p>

<p>'Upon my word this is odd! Why, those pilots on that boat
yonder are going to try it. Do you mean to say that you don't
know as much as they do?'</p>

<p>'THEY! Why, THEY are two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pilots! But
don't you be uneasy; I know as much as any man can afford to know
for a hundred and twenty-five!'</p>

<p>The captain surrendered.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Stephen was bowling through the chute and
showing the rival boat a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar pair of
heels.</p>

<h3>The Pilots' Monopoly</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>ONE day, on board the 'Aleck Scott,' my chief, Mr. Bixby, was
crawling carefully through a close place at Cat Island, both
leads going, and everybody holding his breath. The captain, a
nervous, apprehensive man, kept still as long as he could, but
finally broke down and shouted from the hurricane deck&mdash;</p>

<p>'For gracious' sake, give her steam, Mr. Bixby! give her
steam! She'll never raise the reef on this headway!'</p>

<p>For all the effect that was produced upon Mr. Bixby, one would
have supposed that no remark had been made. But five minutes
later, when the danger was past and the leads laid in, he burst
instantly into a consuming fury, and gave the captain the most
admirable cursing I ever listened to. No bloodshed ensued; but
that was because the captain's cause was weak; for ordinarily he
was not a man to take correction quietly.</p>

<p>Having now set forth in detail the nature of the science of
piloting, and likewise described the rank which the pilot held
among the fraternity of steamboatmen, this seems a fitting place
to say a few words about an organization which the pilots once
formed for the protection of their guild. It was curious and
noteworthy in this, that it was perhaps the compactest, the
completest, and the strongest commercial organization ever formed
among men.</p>

<p>For a long time wages had been two hundred and fifty dollars a
month; but curiously enough, as steamboats multiplied and
business increased, the wages began to fall little by little. It
was easy to discover the reason of this. Too many pilots were
being 'made.' It was nice to have a 'cub,' a steersman, to do all
the hard work for a couple of years, gratis, while his master sat
on a high bench and smoked; all pilots and captains had sons or
nephews who wanted to be pilots. By and by it came to pass that
nearly every pilot on the river had a steersman. When a steersman
had made an amount of progress that was satisfactory to any two
pilots in the trade, they could get a pilot's license for him by
signing an application directed to the United States Inspector.
Nothing further was needed; usually no questions were asked, no
proofs of capacity required.</p>

<p>Very well, this growing swarm of new pilots presently began to
undermine the wages, in order to get berths. Too
late&mdash;apparently&mdash;the knights of the tiller perceived their
mistake. Plainly, something had to be done, and quickly; but what
was to be the needful thing. A close organization. Nothing else
would answer. To compass this seemed an impossibility; so it was
talked, and talked, and then dropped. It was too likely to ruin
whoever ventured to move in the matter. But at last about a dozen
of the boldest&mdash;and some of them the best&mdash;pilots on the river
launched themselves into the enterprise and took all the chances.
They got a special charter from the legislature, with large
powers, under the name of the Pilots' Benevolent Association;
elected their officers, completed their organization, contributed
capital, put 'association' wages up to two hundred and fifty
dollars at once&mdash;and then retired to their homes, for they were
promptly discharged from employment. But there were two or three
unnoticed trifles in their by-laws which had the seeds of
propagation in them. For instance, all idle members of the
association, in good standing, were entitled to a pension of
twenty-five dollars per month. This began to bring in one
straggler after another from the ranks of the new-fledged pilots,
in the dull (summer) season. Better have twenty-five dollars than
starve; the initiation fee was only twelve dollars, and no dues
required from the unemployed.</p>

<p>Also, the widows of deceased members in good standing could
draw twenty-five dollars per month, and a certain sum for each
of their children. Also, the said deceased would be buried at the
association's expense. These things resurrected all the
superannuated and forgotten pilots in the Mississippi Valley.
They came from farms, they came from interior villages, they came
from everywhere. They came on crutches, on drays, in
ambulances,&mdash;any way, so they got there. They paid in their
twelve dollars, and straightway began to draw out twenty-five
dollars a month, and calculate their burial bills.</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>By and by, all the useless, helpless pilots, and a dozen
first-class ones, were in the association, and nine-tenths of the
best pilots out of it and laughing at it. It was the
laughing-stock of the whole river. Everybody joked about the
by-law requiring members to pay ten per cent. of their wages,
every month, into the treasury for the support of the
association, whereas all the members were outcast and tabooed,
and no one would employ them. Everybody was derisively grateful
to the association for taking all the worthless pilots out of the
way and leaving the whole field to the excellent and the
deserving; and everybody was not only jocularly grateful for
that, but for a result which naturally followed, namely, the
gradual advance of wages as the busy season approached. Wages had
gone up from the low figure of one hundred dollars a month to one
hundred and twenty-five, and in some cases to one hundred and
fifty; and it was great fun to enlarge upon the fact that this
charming thing had been accomplished by a body of men not one of
whom received a particle of benefit from it. Some of the jokers
used to call at the association rooms and have a good time
chaffing the members and offering them the charity of taking them
as steersmen for a trip, so that they could see what the
forgotten river looked like. However, the association was
content; or at least it gave no sign to the contrary. Now and
then it captured a pilot who was 'out of luck,' and added him to
its list; and these later additions were very valuable, for they
were good pilots; the incompetent ones had all been absorbed
before. As business freshened, wages climbed gradually up to two
hundred and fifty dollars&mdash;the association figure&mdash;and became
firmly fixed there; and still without benefiting a member of that
body, for no member was hired. The hilarity at the association's
expense burst all bounds, now. There was no end to the fun which
that poor martyr had to put up with.</p>

<p>However, it is a long lane that has no turning. Winter
approached, business doubled and trebled, and an avalanche of
Missouri, Illinois and Upper Mississippi River boats came pouring
down to take a chance in the New Orleans trade. All of a sudden
pilots were in great demand, and were correspondingly scarce. The
time for revenge was come. It was a bitter pill to have to accept
association pilots at last, yet captains and owners agreed that
there was no other way. But none of these outcasts offered! So
there was a still bitterer pill to be swallowed: they must be
sought out and asked for their services. Captain &mdash;&mdash; was the
first man who found it necessary to take the dose, and he had
been the loudest derider of the organization. He hunted up one of
the best of the association pilots and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, you boys have rather got the best of us for a little
while, so I'll give in with as good a grace as I can. I've come
to hire you; get your trunk aboard right away. I want to leave at
twelve o'clock.'</p>

<p>'I don't know about that. Who is your other pilot?'</p>

<p>'I've got I. S&mdash;&mdash;. Why?'</p>

<p>'I can't go with him. He don't belong to the association.'</p>

<p>'What!'</p>

<p>'It's so.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean to tell me that you won't turn a wheel with one
of the very best and oldest pilots on the river because he don't
belong to your association?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I do.'</p>

<p>'Well, if this isn't putting on airs! I supposed I was doing
you a benevolence; but I begin to think that I am the party that
wants a favor done. Are you acting under a law of the
concern?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Show it to me.'</p>

<p>So they stepped into the association rooms, and the secretary
soon satisfied the captain, who said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, what am I to do? I have hired Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; for the entire
season.'</p>

<p>'I will provide for you,' said the secretary. 'I will detail a
pilot to go with you, and he shall be on board at twelve
o'clock.'</p>

<p>'But if I discharge S&mdash;&mdash;, he will come on me for the whole
season's wages.'</p>

<p>'Of course that is a matter between you and Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;,
captain. We cannot meddle in your private affairs.'</p>

<a name="182"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="182.jpg (81K)" src="images/182.jpg" height="584" width="576">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The captain stormed, but to no purpose. In the end he had to
discharge S&mdash;&mdash;, pay him about a thousand dollars, and take an
association pilot in his place. The laugh was beginning to turn
the other way now. Every day, thenceforward, a new victim fell;
every day some outraged captain discharged a non-association pet,
with tears and profanity, and installed a hated association man
in his berth. In a very little while, idle non-associationists
began to be pretty plenty, brisk as business was, and much as
their services were desired. The laugh was shifting to the other
side of their mouths most palpably. These victims, together with
the captains and owners, presently ceased to laugh altogether,
and began to rage about the revenge they would take when the
passing business 'spurt' was over.</p>

<p>Soon all the laughers that were left were the owners and crews
of boats that had two non-association pilots. But their triumph
was not very long-lived. For this reason: It was a rigid rule of
the association that its members should never, under any
circumstances whatever, give information about the channel to any
'outsider.' By this time about half the boats had none but
association pilots, and the other half had none but outsiders. At
the first glance one would suppose that when it came to
forbidding information about the river these two parties could
play equally at that game; but this was not so. At every
good-sized town from one end of the river to the other, there was
a 'wharf-boat' to land at, instead of a wharf or a pier. Freight
was stored in it for transportation; waiting passengers slept in
its cabins. Upon each of these wharf-boats the association's
officers placed a strong box fastened with a peculiar lock which
was used in no other service but one&mdash;the United States mail
service. It was the letter-bag lock, a sacred governmental thing.
By dint of much beseeching the government had been persuaded to
allow the association to use this lock. Every association man
carried a key which would open these boxes. That key, or rather a
peculiar way of holding it in the hand when its owner was asked
for river information by a stranger&mdash;for the success of the St.
Louis and New Orleans association had now bred tolerably thriving
branches in a dozen neighboring steamboat trades&mdash;was the
association man's sign and diploma of membership; and if the
stranger did not respond by producing a similar key and holding
it in a certain manner duly prescribed, his question was politely
ignored.

</center>
<br><br>

<p>
From the association's secretary each member received a
package of more or less gorgeous blanks, printed like a billhead,
on handsome paper, properly ruled in columns; a bill-head worded
something like this&mdash;</p>

<a name="184"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="184.jpg (14K)" src="images/184.jpg" height="179" width="593">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>These blanks were filled up, day by day, as the voyage
progressed, and deposited in the several wharf-boat boxes. For
instance, as soon as the first crossing, out from St. Louis, was
completed, the items would be entered upon the blank, under the
appropriate headings, thus&mdash;</p>

<p>'St. Louis. Nine and a half (feet). Stern on court-house, head
on dead cottonwood above wood-yard, until you raise the first
reef, then pull up square.' Then under head of Remarks: 'Go just
outside the wrecks; this is important. New snag just where you
straighten down; go above it.'</p>

<p>The pilot who deposited that blank in the Cairo box (after
adding to it the details of every crossing all the way down from
St. Louis) took out and read half a dozen fresh reports (from
upward-bound steamers) concerning the river between Cairo and
Memphis, posted himself thoroughly, returned them to the box, and
went back aboard his boat again so armed against accident that he
could not possibly get his boat into trouble without bringing the
most ingenious carelessness to his aid.</p>

<p>Imagine the benefits of so admirable a system in a piece of
river twelve or thirteen hundred miles long, whose channel was
shifting every day! The pilot who had formerly been obliged to
put up with seeing a shoal place once or possibly twice a month,
had a hundred sharp eyes to watch it for him, now, and bushels of
intelligent brains to tell him how to run it. His information
about it was seldom twenty-four hours old. If the reports in the
last box chanced to leave any misgivings on his mind concerning a
treacherous crossing, he had his remedy; he blew his
steam-whistle in a peculiar way as soon as he saw a boat approaching;
the signal was answered in a peculiar way if that boat's pilots
were association men; and then the two steamers ranged alongside
and all uncertainties were swept away by fresh information
furnished to the inquirer by word of mouth and in minute
detail.</p>

<a name="186"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="186.jpg (78K)" src="images/186.jpg" height="478" width="552">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The first thing a pilot did when he reached New Orleans or St.
Louis was to take his final and elaborate report to the
association parlors and hang it up there,&mdash;after which he was
free to visit his family. In these parlors a crowd was always
gathered together, discussing changes in the channel, and the
moment there was a fresh arrival, everybody stopped talking till
this witness had told the newest news and settled the latest
uncertainty. Other craftsmen can 'sink the shop,' sometimes, and
interest themselves in other matters. Not so with a pilot; he
must devote himself wholly to his profession and talk of nothing
else; for it would be small gain to be perfect one day and
imperfect the next. He has no time or words to waste if he would
keep 'posted.'</p>

<p>But the outsiders had a hard time of it. No particular place
to meet and exchange information, no wharf-boat reports, none but
chance and unsatisfactory ways of getting news. The consequence
was that a man sometimes had to run five hundred miles of river
on information that was a week or ten days old. At a fair stage
of the river that might have answered; but when the dead low
water came it was destructive.</p>

<p>Now came another perfectly logical result. The outsiders began
to ground steamboats, sink them, and get into all sorts of
trouble, whereas accidents seemed to keep entirely away from the
association men. Wherefore even the owners and captains of boats
furnished exclusively with outsiders, and previously considered
to be wholly independent of the association and free to comfort
themselves with brag and laughter, began to feel pretty
uncomfortable. Still, they made a show of keeping up the brag,
until one black day when every captain of the lot was formally
ordered to immediately discharge his outsiders and take
association pilots in their stead. And who was it that had the
dashing presumption to do that? Alas, it came from a power behind
the throne that was greater than the throne itself. It was the
underwriters!</p>

<p>It was no time to 'swap knives.' Every outsider had to take
his trunk ashore at once. Of course it was supposed that there
was collusion between the association and the underwriters, but
this was not so. The latter had come to comprehend the excellence
of the 'report' system of the association and the safety it
secured, and so they had made their decision among themselves and
upon plain business principles.</p>

<p>There was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth in the
camp of the outsiders now. But no matter, there was but one
course for them to pursue, and they pursued it. They came forward
in couples and groups, and proffered their twelve dollars and
asked for membership. They were surprised to learn that several
new by-laws had been long ago added. For instance, the initiation
fee had been raised to fifty dollars; that sum must be tendered,
and also ten per cent. of the wages which the applicant had
received each and every month since the founding of the
association. In many cases this amounted to three or four hundred
dollars. Still, the association would not entertain the
application until the money was present. Even then a single
adverse vote killed the application. Every member had to vote
'Yes' or 'No' in person and before witnesses; so it took weeks to
decide a candidacy, because many pilots were so long absent on
voyages. However, the repentant sinners scraped their savings
together, and one by one, by our tedious voting process, they
were added to the fold. A time came, at last, when only about ten
remained outside. They said they would starve before they would
apply. They remained idle a long while, because of course nobody
could venture to employ them.</p>

<p>By and by the association published the fact that upon a
certain date the wages would be raised to five hundred dollars
per month. All the branch associations had grown strong, now, and
the Red River one had advanced wages to seven hundred dollars a
month. Reluctantly the ten outsiders yielded, in view of these
things, and made application. There was another new by-law, by
this time, which required them to pay dues not only on all the
wages they had received since the association was born, but also
on what they would have received if they had continued at work up
to the time of their application, instead of going off to pout in
idleness. It turned out to be a difficult matter to elect them,
but it was accomplished at last. The most virulent sinner of this
batch had stayed out and allowed 'dues' to accumulate against him
so long that he had to send in six hundred and twenty-five
dollars with his application.</p>

<p>The association had a good bank account now, and was very
strong. There was no longer an outsider. A by-law was added
forbidding the reception of any more cubs or apprentices for five
years; after which time a limited number would be taken, not by
individuals, but by the association, upon these terms: the
applicant must not be less than eighteen years old, and of
respectable family and good character; he must pass an
examination as to education, pay a thousand dollars in advance
for the privilege of becoming an apprentice, and must remain
under the commands of the association until a great part of the
membership (more than half, I think) should be willing to sign
his application for a pilot's license.</p>

<p>All previously-articled apprentices were now taken away from
their masters and adopted by the association. The president and
secretary detailed them for service on one boat or another, as
they chose, and changed them from boat to boat according to
certain rules. If a pilot could show that he was in infirm health
and needed assistance, one of the cubs would be ordered to go
with him.</p>

<p>The widow and orphan list grew, but so did the association's
financial resources. The association attended its own funerals in
state, and paid for them. When occasion demanded, it sent members
down the river upon searches for the bodies of brethren lost by
steamboat accidents; a search of this kind sometimes cost a
thousand dollars.</p>

<p>The association procured a charter and went into the insurance
business, also. It not only insured the lives of its members, but
took risks on steamboats.</p>

<p>The organization seemed indestructible. It was the tightest
monopoly in the world. By the United States law, no man could
become a pilot unless two duly licensed pilots signed his
application; and now there was nobody outside of the association
competent to sign. Consequently the making of pilots was at an
end. Every year some would die and others become incapacitated by
age and infirmity; there would be no new ones to take their
places. In time, the association could put wages up to any figure
it chose; and as long as it should be wise enough not to carry
the thing too far and provoke the national government into
amending the licensing system, steamboat owners would have to
submit, since there would be no help for it.</p>

<p>The owners and captains were the only obstruction that lay
between the association and absolute power; and at last this one
was removed. Incredible as it may seem, the owners and captains
deliberately did it themselves. When the pilots' association
announced, months beforehand, that on the first day of September,
1861, wages would be advanced to five hundred dollars per month,
the owners and captains instantly put freights up a few cents,
and explained to the farmers along the river the necessity of it,
by calling their attention to the burdensome rate of wages about
to be established. It was a rather slender argument, but the
farmers did not seem to detect it. It looked reasonable to them
that to add five cents freight on a bushel of corn was
justifiable under the circumstances, overlooking the fact that
this advance on a cargo of forty thousand sacks was a good deal
more than necessary to cover the new wages.</p>

<br><br>

<p>So, straightway the captains and owners got up an association
of their own, and proposed to put captains' wages up to five
hundred dollars, too, and move for another advance in freights.
It was a novel idea, but of course an effect which had been
produced once could be produced again. The new association
decreed (for this was before all the outsiders had been taken
into the pilots' association) that if any captain employed a
non-association pilot, he should be forced to discharge him, and
also pay a fine of five hundred dollars. Several of these heavy
fines were paid before the captains' organization grew strong
enough to exercise full authority over its membership; but that
all ceased, presently. The captains tried to get the pilots to
decree that no member of their corporation should serve under a
non-association captain; but this proposition was declined. The
pilots saw that they would be backed up by the captains and the
underwriters anyhow, and so they wisely refrained from entering
into entangling alliances.</p>

<p>As I have remarked, the pilots' association was now the
compactest monopoly in the world, perhaps, and seemed simply
indestructible. And yet the days of its glory were numbered.
First, the new railroad stretching up through Mississippi,
Tennessee, and Kentucky, to Northern railway centers, began to
divert the passenger travel from the steamers; next the war came
and almost entirely annihilated the steamboating industry during
several years, leaving most of the pilots idle, and the cost of
living advancing all the time; then the treasurer of the St.
Louis association put his hand into the till and walked off with
every dollar of the ample fund; and finally, the railroads
intruding everywhere, there was little for steamers to do, when
the war was over, but carry freights; so straightway some genius
from the Atlantic coast introduced the plan of towing a dozen
steamer cargoes down to New Orleans at the tail of a vulgar
little tug-boat; and behold, in the twinkling of an eye, as it
were, the association and the noble science of piloting were
things of the dead and pathetic past!</p>
