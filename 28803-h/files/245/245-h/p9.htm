<p>THE approaches to New Orleans were familiar; general aspects
were unchanged. When one goes flying through London along a
railway propped in the air on tall arches, he may inspect miles
of upper bedrooms through the open windows, but the lower half of
the houses is under his level and out of sight. Similarly, in
high-river stage, in the New Orleans region, the water is up to
the top of the enclosing levee-rim, the flat country behind it
lies low&mdash;representing the bottom of a dish&mdash;and as the boat
swims along, high on the flood, one looks down upon the houses
and into the upper windows. There is nothing but that frail
breastwork of earth between the people and destruction.</p>

<p>The old brick salt-warehouses clustered at the upper end of
the city looked as they had always looked; warehouses which had
had a kind of Aladdin's lamp experience, however, since I had
seen them; for when the war broke out the proprietor went to bed
one night leaving them packed with thousands of sacks of vulgar
salt, worth a couple of dollars a sack, and got up in the morning
and found his mountain of salt turned into a mountain of gold, so
to speak, so suddenly and to so dizzy a height had the war news
sent up the price of the article.</p>

<p>The vast reach of plank wharves remained unchanged, and there
were as many ships as ever: but the long array of steamboats had
vanished; not altogether, of course, but not much of it was
left.</p>

<p>The city itself had not changed&mdash;to the eye. It had greatly
increased in spread and population, but the look of the town was
not altered. The dust, waste-paper-littered, was still deep in
the streets; the deep, trough-like gutters alongside the
curbstones were still half full of reposeful water with a dusty
surface; the sidewalks were still&mdash;in the sugar and bacon
region&mdash;encumbered by casks and barrels and hogsheads; the great
blocks of austerely plain commercial houses were as
dusty-looking as ever.</p>

<p>Canal Street was finer, and more attractive and stirring than
formerly, with its drifting crowds of people, its several
processions of hurrying street-cars, and&mdash;toward evening&mdash;its
broad second-story verandas crowded with gentlemen and ladies
clothed according to the latest mode.</p>

<a name="425"></a>
<br><br>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>Not that there is any 'architecture' in Canal Street: to speak
in broad, general terms, there is no architecture in New Orleans,
except in the cemeteries. It seems a strange thing to say of a
wealthy, far-seeing, and energetic city of a quarter of a
million inhabitants, but it is true. There is a huge granite U.S.
Custom-house&mdash;costly enough, genuine enough, but as a decoration
it is inferior to a gasometer. It looks like a state prison. But
it was built before the war. Architecture in America may be said
to have been born since the war. New Orleans, I believe, has had
the good luck&mdash;and in a sense the bad luck&mdash;to have had no great
fire in late years. It must be so. If the opposite had been the
case, I think one would be able to tell the 'burnt district' by
the radical improvement in its architecture over the old forms.
One can do this in Boston and Chicago. The 'burnt district' of
Boston was commonplace before the fire; but now there is no
commercial district in any city in the world that can surpass
it&mdash;or perhaps even rival it&mdash;in beauty, elegance, and
tastefulness.</p>

<p>However, New Orleans has begun&mdash;just this moment, as one may
say. When completed, the new Cotton Exchange will be a stately
and beautiful building; massive, substantial, full of
architectural graces; no shams or false pretenses or uglinesses
about it anywhere. To the city, it will be worth many times its
cost, for it will breed its species. What has been lacking
hitherto, was a model to build toward; something to educate eye
and taste; a SUGGESTER, so to speak.</p>

<br><br>

<img alt="428.jpg (54K)" src="images/428.jpg" height="407" width="550">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The city is well outfitted with progressive men&mdash;thinking,
sagacious, long-headed men. The contrast between the spirit of
the city and the city's architecture is like the contrast between
waking and sleep. Apparently there is a 'boom' in everything but
that one dead feature. The water in the gutters used to be
stagnant and slimy, and a potent disease-breeder; but the gutters
are flushed now, two or three times a day, by powerful machinery;
in many of the gutters the water never stands still, but has a
steady current. Other sanitary improvements have been made; and
with such effect that New Orleans claims to be (during the long
intervals between the occasional yellow-fever assaults) one of
the healthiest cities in the Union. There's plenty of ice now for
everybody, manufactured in the town. It is a driving place
commercially, and has a great river, ocean, and railway business.
At the date of our visit, it was the best lighted city in the
Union, electrically speaking. The New Orleans electric lights
were more numerous than those of New York, and very much better.
One had this modified noonday not only in Canal and some
neighboring chief streets, but all along a stretch of five miles
of river frontage. There are good clubs in the city now&mdash;several
of them but recently organized&mdash;and inviting modern-style
pleasure resorts at West End and Spanish Fort. The telephone is
everywhere. One of the most notable advances is in journalism.
The newspapers, as I remember them, were not a striking feature.
Now they are. Money is spent upon them with a free hand. They get
the news, let it cost what it may. The editorial work is not
hack-grinding, but literature. As an example of New Orleans
journalistic achievement, it may be mentioned that the
'Times-Democrat' of August 26, 1882, contained a report of the
year's business of the towns of the Mississippi Valley, from New
Orleans all the way to St. Paul&mdash;two thousand miles. That issue
of the paper consisted of forty pages; seven columns to the page;
two hundred and eighty columns in all; fifteen hundred words to
the column; an aggregate of four hundred and twenty thousand
words. That is to say, not much short of three times as many
words as there are in this book. One may with sorrow contrast
this with the architecture of New Orleans.</p>

<p>I have been speaking of public architecture only. The domestic
article in New Orleans is reproachless, notwithstanding it
remains as it always was. All the dwellings are of wood&mdash;in the
American part of the town, I mean&mdash;and all have a comfortable
look. Those in the wealthy quarter are spacious; painted
snow-white usually, and generally have wide verandas, or
double-verandas, supported by ornamental columns. These mansions
stand in the center of large grounds, and rise, garlanded with
roses, out of the midst of swelling masses of shining green
foliage and many-colored blossoms. No houses could well be in
better harmony with their surroundings, or more pleasing to the
eye, or more home-like and comfortable-looking.</p>

<p>One even becomes reconciled to the cistern presently; this is
a mighty cask, painted green, and sometimes a couple of stories
high, which is propped against the house-corner on stilts. There
is a mansion-and-brewery suggestion about the combination which
seems very incongruous at first. But the people cannot have
wells, and so they take rain-water. Neither can they conveniently
have cellars, or graves,{footnote [The Israelites are buried in
graves&mdash;by permission, I take it, not requirement; but none else,
except the destitute, who are buried at public expense. The
graves are but three or four feet deep.]} the town being built
upon 'made' ground; so they do without both, and few of the
living complain, and none of the others.</p>

<p>THEY bury their dead in vaults, above the ground. These vaults
have a resemblance to houses&mdash;sometimes to temples; are built of
marble, generally; are architecturally graceful and shapely; they
face the walks and driveways of the cemetery; and when one moves
through the midst of a thousand or so of them and sees their
white roofs and gables stretching into the distance on every
hand, the phrase 'city of the dead' has all at once a meaning to
him. Many of the cemeteries are beautiful, and are kept in
perfect order. When one goes from the levee or the business
streets near it, to a cemetery, he observes to himself that if
those people down there would live as neatly while they are alive
as they do after they are dead, they would find many advantages
in it; and besides, their quarter would be the wonder and
admiration of the business world. Fresh flowers, in vases of
water, are to be seen at the portals of many of the vaults:
placed there by the pious hands of bereaved parents and children,
husbands and wives, and renewed daily. A milder form of sorrow
finds its inexpensive and lasting remembrancer in the coarse and
ugly but indestructible 'immortelle'&mdash;which is a wreath or cross
or some such emblem, made of rosettes of black linen, with
sometimes a yellow rosette at the conjunction of the cross's
bars&mdash;kind of sorrowful breast-pin, so to say. The immortelle
requires no attention: you just hang it up, and there you are;
just leave it alone, it will take care of your grief for you, and
keep it in mind better than you can; stands weather first-rate,
and lasts like boiler-iron.</p>

<p>On sunny days, pretty little chameleons&mdash;gracefullest of
legged reptiles&mdash;creep along the marble fronts of the vaults, and
catch flies. Their changes of color&mdash;as to variety&mdash;are not up to
the creature's reputation. They change color when a person comes
along and hangs up an immortelle; but that is nothing: any
right-feeling reptile would do that.</p>

<p>I will gradually drop this subject of graveyards. I have been
trying all I could to get down to the sentimental part of it, but
I cannot accomplish it. I think there is no genuinely sentimental
part to it. It is all grotesque, ghastly, horrible. Graveyards
may have been justifiable in the bygone ages, when nobody knew
that for every dead body put into the ground, to glut the earth
and the plant-roots, and the air with disease-germs, five or
fifty, or maybe a hundred persons must die before their proper
time; but they are hardly justifiable now, when even the children
know that a dead saint enters upon a century-long career of
assassination the moment the earth closes over his corpse. It is
a grim sort of a thought. The relics of St. Anne, up in Canada,
have now, after nineteen hundred years, gone to curing the sick
by the dozen. But it is merest matter-of-course that these same
relics, within a generation after St. Anne's death and burial,
MADE several thousand people sick. Therefore these
miracle-performances are simply compensation, nothing more. St.
Anne is somewhat slow pay, for a Saint, it is true; but better a
debt paid after nineteen hundred years, and outlawed by the
statute of limitations, than not paid at all; and most of the
knights of the halo do not pay at all. Where you find one that
pays&mdash;like St. Anne&mdash;you find a hundred and fifty that take the
benefit of the statute. And none of them pay any more than the
principal of what they owe&mdash;they pay none of the interest either
simple or compound. A Saint can never QUITE return the principal,
however; for his dead body KILLS people, whereas his relics HEAL
only&mdash;they never restore the dead to life. That part of the
account is always left unsettled.</p>

<p>'Dr. F. Julius Le Moyne, after fifty years of medical
practice, wrote: "The inhumation of human bodies, dead from
infectious diseases, results in constantly loading the
atmosphere, and polluting the waters, with not only the germs
that rise from simply putrefaction, but also with the SPECIFIC
germs of the diseases from which death resulted."</p>

<p>'The gases (from buried corpses) will rise to the surface
through eight or ten feet of gravel, just as coal-gas will do,
and there is practically no limit to their power of escape.</p>

<p>'During the epidemic in New Orleans in 1853, Dr. E. H. Barton
reported that in the Fourth District the mortality was four
hundred and fifty-two per thousand&mdash;more than double that of any
other. In this district were three large cemeteries, in which
during the previous year more than three thousand bodies had been
buried. In other districts the proximity of cemeteries seemed to
aggravate the disease.</p>

<p>'In 1828 Professor Bianchi demonstrated how the fearful
reappearance of the plague at Modena was caused by excavations in
ground where, THREE HUNDRED YEARS PREVIOUSLY, the victims of the
pestilence had been buried. Mr. Cooper, in explaining the causes
of some epidemics, remarks that the opening of the plague
burial-grounds at Eyam resulted in an immediate outbreak of
disease.'&mdash;NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW, NO. 3, VOL. 135.</p>

<p>In an address before the Chicago Medical Society, in advocacy
of cremation, Dr. Charles W. Purdy made some striking comparisons
to show what a burden is laid upon society by the burial of the
dead:&mdash;</p>

<p>'One and one-fourth times more money is expended annually in
funerals in the United States than the Government expends for
public-school purposes. Funerals cost this country in 1880 enough
money to pay the liabilities of all the commercial failures in
the United States during the same year, and give each bankrupt a
capital of $8,630 with which to resume business. Funerals cost
annually more money than the value of the combined gold and
silver yield of the United States in the year 1880! These figures
do not include the sums invested in burial-grounds and expended
in tombs and monuments, nor the loss from depreciation of
property in the vicinity of cemeteries.'</p>

<p>For the rich, cremation would answer as well as burial; for
the ceremonies connected with it could be made as costly and
ostentatious as a Hindu suttee; while for the poor, cremation
would be better than burial, because so cheap {footnote [Four or
five dollars is the minimum cost.]}&mdash;so cheap until the poor got
to imitating the rich, which they would do by-and-bye. The
adoption of cremation would relieve us of a muck of threadbare
burial-witticisms; but, on the other hand, it would resurrect a
lot of mildewed old cremation-jokes that have had a rest for two
thousand years.</p>

<p>I have a colored acquaintance who earns his living by odd jobs
and heavy manual labor. He never earns above four hundred dollars
in a year, and as he has a wife and several young children, the
closest scrimping is necessary to get him through to the end of
the twelve months debtless. To such a man a funeral is a colossal
financial disaster. While I was writing one of the preceding
chapters, this man lost a little child. He walked the town over
with a friend, trying to find a coffin that was within his means.
He bought the very cheapest one he could find, plain wood,
stained. It cost him twenty-six dollars. It would have cost less
than four, probably, if it had been built to put something useful
into. He and his family will feel that outlay a good many
months.</p>

<p>ABOUT the same time, I encountered a man in the street, whom I
had not seen for six or seven years; and something like this talk
followed. I said&mdash;</p>

<p>'But you used to look sad and oldish; you don't now. Where did
you get all this youth and bubbling cheerfulness? Give me the
address.'</p>

<p>He chuckled blithely, took off his shining tile, pointed to a
notched pink circlet of paper pasted into its crown, with
something lettered on it, and went on chuckling while I read, 'J.
B&mdash;&mdash;, UNDERTAKER.' Then he clapped his hat on, gave it an
irreverent tilt to leeward, and cried out&mdash;</p>

<p>'That's what's the matter! It used to be rough times with me
when you knew me&mdash;insurance-agency business, you know; mighty
irregular. Big fire, all right&mdash;brisk trade for ten days while
people scared; after that, dull policy-business till next fire.
Town like this don't have fires often enough&mdash;a fellow strikes so
many dull weeks in a row that he gets discouraged. But you bet
you, this is the business! People don't wait for examples to die.
No, sir, they drop off right along&mdash;there ain't any dull spots in
the undertaker line. I just started in with two or three little
old coffins and a hired hearse, and now look at the thing! I've
worked up a business here that would satisfy any man, don't care
who he is. Five years ago, lodged in an attic; live in a swell
house now, with a mansard roof, and all the modern
inconveniences.'</p>

<p>'Does a coffin pay so well. Is there much profit on a
coffin?'</p>

<p>'Go-way! How you talk!' Then, with a confidential wink, a
dropping of the voice, and an impressive laying of his hand on my
arm; 'Look here; there's one thing in this world which isn't ever
cheap. That's a coffin. There's one thing in this world which a
person don't ever try to jew you down on. That's a coffin.
There's one thing in this world which a person don't say&mdash;"I'll
look around a little, and if I find I can't do better I'll come
back and take it." That's a coffin. There's one thing in this
world which a person won't take in pine if he can go walnut; and
won't take in walnut if he can go mahogany; and won't take in
mahogany if he can go an iron casket with silver door-plate and
bronze handles. That's a coffin. And there's one thing in this
world which you don't have to worry around after a person to get
him to pay for. And that's a coffin. Undertaking?&mdash;why it's the
dead-surest business in Christendom, and the nobbiest.</p>

<img alt="437.jpg (47K)" src="images/437.jpg" height="494" width="397">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>'Why, just look at it. A rich man won't have anything but your
very best; and you can just pile it on, too&mdash;pile it on and sock
it to him&mdash;he won't ever holler. And you take in a poor man, and
if you work him right he'll bust himself on a single lay-out. Or
especially a woman. F'r instance: Mrs. O'Flaherty comes
in&mdash;widow&mdash;wiping her eyes and kind of moaning. Unhandkerchiefs
one eye, bats it around tearfully over the stock; says&mdash;</p>

<p>'"And fhat might ye ask for that wan?"</p>

<p>'"Thirty-nine dollars, madam," says I.</p>

<p>'"It 's a foine big price, sure, but Pat shall be buried like
a gintleman, as he was, if I have to work me fingers off for it.
I'll have that wan, sor."</p>

<p>'"Yes, madam," says I, "and it is a very good one, too; not
costly, to be sure, but in this life we must cut our garment to
our clothes, as the saying is." And as she starts out, I heave
in, kind of casually, "This one with the white satin lining is a
beauty, but I am afraid&mdash;well, sixty-five dollars is a
rather&mdash;rather&mdash;but no matter, I felt obliged to say to Mrs.
O'Shaughnessy&mdash;"</p>

<p>'"D'ye mane to soy that Bridget O'Shaughnessy bought the mate
to that joo-ul box to ship that dhrunken divil to Purgatory
in?"</p>

<p>'"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>'"Then Pat shall go to heaven in the twin to it, if it takes
the last rap the O'Flaherties can raise; and moind you, stick on
some extras, too, and I'll give ye another dollar."</p>

<br><br>

<p>'And as I lay-in with the livery stables, of course I don't
forget to mention that Mrs. O'Shaughnessy hired fifty-four
dollars' worth of hacks and flung as much style into Dennis's
funeral as if he had been a duke or an assassin. And of course
she sails in and goes the O'Shaughnessy about four hacks and an
omnibus better. That used to be, but that's all played now; that
is, in this particular town. The Irish got to piling up hacks so,
on their funerals, that a funeral left them ragged and hungry for
two years afterward; so the priest pitched in and broke it all
up. He don't allow them to have but two hacks now, and sometimes
only one.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said I, 'if you are so light-hearted and jolly in
ordinary times, what must you be in an epidemic?'</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>'No, you're off, there. We don't like to see an epidemic. An
epidemic don't pay. Well, of course I don't mean that, exactly;
but it don't pay in proportion to the regular thing. Don't it
occur to you, why?'</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>'Think.'</p>

<p>'I can't imagine. What is it?'</p>

<p>'It's just two things.'</p>

<p>'Well, what are they?'</p>

<p>'One's Embamming.'</p>

<p>'Well, in ordinary times, a person dies, and we lay him up in
ice; one day two days, maybe three, to wait for friends to come.
Takes a lot of it&mdash;melts fast. We charge jewelry rates for that
ice, and war-prices for attendance. Well, don't you know, when
there's an epidemic, they rush 'em to the cemetery the minute the
breath's out. No market for ice in an epidemic. Same with
Embamming. You take a family that's able to embam, and you've got
a soft thing. You can mention sixteen different ways to do
it&mdash;though there AIN'T only one or two ways, when you come down
to the bottom facts of it&mdash;and they'll take the highest-priced
way, every time. It's human nature&mdash;human nature in grief. It
don't reason, you see. Time being, it don't care a dam. All it
wants is physical immortality for deceased, and they're willing
to pay for it. All you've got to do is to just be ca'm and stack
it up&mdash;they'll stand the racket. Why, man, you can take a defunct
that you couldn't GIVE away; and get your embamming traps around
you and go to work; and in a couple of hours he is worth a cool
six hundred&mdash;that's what HE'S worth. There ain't anything equal
to it but trading rats for di'monds in time of famine. Well,
don't you see, when there's an epidemic, people don't wait to
embam. No, indeed they don't; and it hurts the business like
hell-th, as we say&mdash;hurts it like hell-th, HEALTH, see?&mdash;Our
little joke in the trade. Well, I must be going. Give me a call
whenever you need any&mdash;I mean, when you're going by,
sometime.'</p>

<p>In his joyful high spirits, he did the exaggerating himself,
if any has been done. I have not enlarged on him.</p>

<p>With the above brief references to inhumation, let us leave
the subject. As for me, I hope to be cremated. I made that remark
to my pastor once, who said, with what he seemed to think was an
impressive manner&mdash;</p>

<p>'I wouldn't worry about that, if I had your chances.' Much he
knew about it&mdash;the family all so opposed to it.</p>

<h3>City Sights</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>THE old French part of New Orleans&mdash;anciently the Spanish
part&mdash;bears no resemblance to the American end of the city: the
American end which lies beyond the intervening brick
business-center. The houses are massed in blocks; are austerely
plain and dignified; uniform of pattern, with here and there a
departure from it with pleasant effect; all are plastered on the
outside, and nearly all have long, iron-railed verandas running
along the several stories. Their chief beauty is the deep, warm,
varicolored stain with which time and the weather have enriched
the plaster. It harmonizes with all the surroundings, and has as
natural a look of belonging there as has the flush upon sunset
clouds. This charming decoration cannot be successfully imitated;
neither is it to be found elsewhere in America.</p>

<a name="443"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="443.jpg (95K)" src="images/443.jpg" height="672" width="642">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The iron railings are a specialty, also. The pattern is often
exceedingly light and dainty, and airy and graceful&mdash;with a large
cipher or monogram in the center, a delicate cobweb of baffling,
intricate forms, wrought in steel. The ancient railings are
hand-made, and are now comparatively rare and proportionately
valuable. They are become BRIC-A-BRAC.</p>

<p>The party had the privilege of idling through this ancient
quarter of New Orleans with the South's finest literary genius,
the author of 'the Grandissimes.' In him the South has found a
masterly delineator of its interior life and its history. In
truth, I find by experience, that the untrained eye and vacant
mind can inspect it, and learn of it, and judge of it, more
clearly and profitably in his books than by personal contact with
it.</p>

<p>With Mr. Cable along to see for you, and describe and explain
and illuminate, a jog through that old quarter is a vivid
pleasure. And you have a vivid sense as of unseen or dimly seen
things&mdash;vivid, and yet fitful and darkling; you glimpse salient
features, but lose the fine shades or catch them imperfectly
through the vision of the imagination: a case, as it were, of
ignorant near-sighted stranger traversing the rim of wide vague
horizons of Alps with an inspired and enlightened long-sighted
native.</p>

<p>We visited the old St. Louis Hotel, now occupied by municipal
offices. There is nothing strikingly remarkable about it; but one
can say of it as of the Academy of Music in New York, that if a
broom or a shovel has ever been used in it there is no
circumstantial evidence to back up the fact. It is curious that
cabbages and hay and things do not grow in the Academy of Music;
but no doubt it is on account of the interruption of the light by
the benches, and the impossibility of hoeing the crop except in
the aisles. The fact that the ushers grow their
buttonhole-bouquets on the premises shows what might be done if they had the
right kind of an agricultural head to the establishment.</p>

<p>We visited also the venerable Cathedral, and the pretty square
in front of it; the one dim with religious light, the other
brilliant with the worldly sort, and lovely with orange-trees and
blossomy shrubs; then we drove in the hot sun through the
wilderness of houses and out on to the wide dead level beyond,
where the villas are, and the water wheels to drain the town, and
the commons populous with cows and children; passing by an old
cemetery where we were told lie the ashes of an early pirate; but
we took him on trust, and did not visit him. He was a pirate with
a tremendous and sanguinary history; and as long as he preserved
unspotted, in retirement, the dignity of his name and the
grandeur of his ancient calling, homage and reverence were his
from high and low; but when at last he descended into politics
and became a paltry alderman, the public 'shook' him, and turned
aside and wept. When he died, they set up a monument over him;
and little by little he has come into respect again; but it is
respect for the pirate, not the alderman. To-day the loyal and
generous remember only what he was, and charitably forget what he
became.</p>

<br><br>

<img alt="445.jpg (74K)" src="images/445.jpg" height="360" width="554">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Thence, we drove a few miles across a swamp, along a raised
shell road, with a canal on one hand and a dense wood on the
other; and here and there, in the distance, a ragged and
angular-limbed and moss-bearded cypress, top standing out, clear
cut against the sky, and as quaint of form as the apple-trees in
Japanese pictures&mdash;such was our course and the surroundings of
it. There was an occasional alligator swimming comfortably along
in the canal, and an occasional picturesque colored person on the
bank, flinging his statue-rigid reflection upon the still water
and watching for a bite.</p>

<p>And by-and-bye we reached the West End, a collection of hotels
of the usual light summer-resort pattern, with broad verandas all
around, and the waves of the wide and blue Lake Pontchartrain
lapping the thresholds. We had dinner on a ground-veranda over
the water&mdash;the chief dish the renowned fish called the pompano,
delicious as the less criminal forms of sin.</p>

<a name="446"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="446.jpg (52K)" src="images/446.jpg" height="351" width="547">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Thousands of people come by rail and carriage to West End and
to Spanish Fort every evening, and dine, listen to the bands,
take strolls in the open air under the electric lights, go
sailing on the lake, and entertain themselves in various and
sundry other ways.</p>

<p>We had opportunities on other days and in other places to test
the pompano. Notably, at an editorial dinner at one of the clubs
in the city. He was in his last possible perfection there, and
justified his fame. In his suite was a tall pyramid of scarlet
cray-fish&mdash;large ones; as large as one's thumb&mdash;delicate,
palatable, appetizing. Also deviled whitebait; also shrimps of
choice quality; and a platter of small soft-shell crabs of a
most superior breed. The other dishes were what one might get at
Delmonico's, or Buckingham Palace; those I have spoken of can be
had in similar perfection in New Orleans only, I suppose.</p>

<p>In the West and South they have a new institution&mdash;the Broom
Brigade. It is composed of young ladies who dress in a uniform
costume, and go through the infantry drill, with broom in place
of musket. It is a very pretty sight, on private view. When they
perform on the stage of a theater, in the blaze of colored fires,
it must be a fine and fascinating spectacle. I saw them go
through their complex manual with grace, spirit, and admirable
precision. I saw them do everything which a human being can
possibly do with a broom, except sweep. I did not see them sweep.
But I know they could learn. What they have already learned
proves that. And if they ever should learn, and should go on the
war-path down Tchoupitoulas or some of those other streets
around there, those thoroughfares would bear a greatly improved
aspect in a very few minutes. But the girls themselves wouldn't;
so nothing would be really gained, after all.</p>

<a name="447"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="447.jpg (97K)" src="images/447.jpg" height="632" width="599">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The drill was in the Washington Artillery building. In this
building we saw many interesting relics of the war. Also a fine
oil-painting representing Stonewall Jackson's last interview with
General Lee. Both men are on horseback. Jackson has just ridden
up, and is accosting Lee. The picture is very valuable, on
account of the portraits, which are authentic. But, like many
another historical picture, it means nothing without its label.
And one label will fit it as well as another&mdash;</p>

<p>First Interview between Lee and Jackson.</p>

<p>Last Interview between Lee and Jackson.</p>

<p>Jackson Introducing Himself to Lee.</p>

<p>Jackson Accepting Lee's Invitation to Dinner.</p>

<p>Jackson Declining Lee's Invitation to Dinner&mdash;with Thanks.</p>

<p>Jackson Apologizing for a Heavy Defeat.</p>

<p>Jackson Reporting a Great Victory.</p>

<p>Jackson Asking Lee for a Match.</p>

<p>It tells ONE story, and a sufficient one; for it says quite
plainly and satisfactorily, 'Here are Lee and Jackson together.'
The artist would have made it tell that this is Lee and Jackson's
last interview if he could have done it. But he couldn't, for
there wasn't any way to do it. A good legible label is usually
worth, for information, a ton of significant attitude and
expression in a historical picture. In Rome, people with fine
sympathetic natures stand up and weep in front of the celebrated
'Beatrice Cenci the Day before her Execution.' It shows what a
label can do. If they did not know the picture, they would
inspect it unmoved, and say, 'Young girl with hay fever; young
girl with her head in a bag.'</p>

<p>I found the half-forgotten Southern intonations and elisions
as pleasing to my ear as they had formerly been. A Southerner
talks music. At least it is music to me, but then I was born in
the South. The educated Southerner has no use for an r, except at
the beginning of a word. He says 'honah,' and 'dinnah,' and
'Gove'nuh,' and 'befo' the waw,' and so on. The words may lack
charm to the eye, in print, but they have it to the ear. When did
the r disappear from Southern speech, and how did it come to
disappear? The custom of dropping it was not borrowed from the
North, nor inherited from England. Many Southerners&mdash;most
Southerners&mdash;put a y into occasional words that begin with the k
sound. For instance, they say Mr. K'yahtah (Carter) and speak of
playing k'yahds or of riding in the k'yahs. And they have the
pleasant custom&mdash;long ago fallen into decay in the North&mdash;of
frequently employing the respectful 'Sir.' Instead of the curt
Yes, and the abrupt No, they say 'Yes, Suh', 'No, Suh.'</p>

<a name="449"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="449.jpg (44K)" src="images/449.jpg" height="581" width="287">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>But there are some infelicities. Such as 'like' for 'as,' and
the addition of an 'at' where it isn't needed. I heard an
educated gentleman say, 'Like the flag-officer did.' His cook or
his butler would have said, 'Like the flag-officer done.' You
hear gentlemen say, 'Where have you been at?' And here is the
aggravated form&mdash;heard a ragged street Arab say it to a comrade:
'I was a-ask'n' Tom whah you was a-sett'n' at.' The very elect
carelessly say 'will' when they mean 'shall'; and many of them
say, 'I didn't go to do it,' meaning 'I didn't mean to do it.'
The Northern word 'guess'&mdash;imported from England, where it used
to be common, and now regarded by satirical Englishmen as a
Yankee original&mdash;is but little used among Southerners. They say
'reckon.' They haven't any 'doesn't' in their language; they say
'don't' instead. The unpolished often use 'went' for 'gone.' It
is nearly as bad as the Northern 'hadn't ought.' This reminds me
that a remark of a very peculiar nature was made here in my
neighborhood (in the North) a few days ago: 'He hadn't ought to
have went.' How is that? Isn't that a good deal of a triumph? One
knows the orders combined in this half-breed's architecture
without inquiring: one parent Northern, the other Southern.
To-day I heard a schoolmistress ask, 'Where is John gone?' This
form is so common&mdash;so nearly universal, in fact&mdash;that if she had
used 'whither' instead of 'where,' I think it would have sounded
like an affectation.</p>

<p>We picked up one excellent word&mdash;a word worth traveling to New
Orleans to get; a nice limber, expressive, handy
word&mdash;'lagniappe.' They pronounce it lanny-yap. It is Spanish&mdash;so
they said. We discovered it at the head of a column of odds and
ends in the Picayune, the first day; heard twenty people use it
the second; inquired what it meant the third; adopted it and got
facility in swinging it the fourth. It has a restricted meaning,
but I think the people spread it out a little when they choose.
It is the equivalent of the thirteenth roll in a 'baker's dozen.'
It is something thrown in, gratis, for good measure. The custom
originated in the Spanish quarter of the city. When a child or a
servant buys something in a shop&mdash;or even the mayor or the
governor, for aught I know&mdash;he finishes the operation by
saying&mdash;</p>

<p>'Give me something for lagniappe.'</p>

<a name="453"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="453.jpg (54K)" src="images/453.jpg" height="458" width="440">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>The shopman always responds; gives the child a bit of
licorice-root, gives the servant a cheap cigar or a spool of
thread, gives the governor&mdash;I don't know what he gives the
governor; support, likely.</p>

<p>When you are invited to drink, and this does occur now and
then in New Orleans&mdash;and you say, 'What, again?&mdash;no, I've had
enough;' the other party says, 'But just this one time more&mdash;this
is for lagniappe.' When the beau perceives that he is stacking
his compliments a trifle too high, and sees by the young lady's
countenance that the edifice would have been better with the top
compliment left off, he puts his 'I beg pardon&mdash;no harm
intended,' into the briefer form of 'Oh, that's for lagniappe.'
If the waiter in the restaurant stumbles and spills a gill of
coffee down the back of your neck, he says 'For lagniappe, sah,'
and gets you another cup without extra charge.</p>

<h3>Southern Sports</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>IN the North one hears the war mentioned, in social
conversation, once a month; sometimes as often as once a week;
but as a distinct subject for talk, it has long ago been relieved
of duty. There are sufficient reasons for this. Given a dinner
company of six gentlemen to-day, it can easily happen that four
of them&mdash;and possibly five&mdash;were not in the field at all. So the
chances are four to two, or five to one, that the war will at no
time during the evening become the topic of conversation; and the
chances are still greater that if it become the topic it will
remain so but a little while. If you add six ladies to the
company, you have added six people who saw so little of the dread
realities of the war that they ran out of talk concerning them
years ago, and now would soon weary of the war topic if you
brought it up.</p>

<p>The case is very different in the South. There, every man you
meet was in the war; and every lady you meet saw the war. The war
is the great chief topic of conversation. The interest in it is
vivid and constant; the interest in other topics is fleeting.
Mention of the war will wake up a dull company and set their
tongues going, when nearly any other topic would fail. In the
South, the war is what A.D. is elsewhere: they date from it. All
day long you hear things 'placed' as having happened since the
waw; or du'in' the waw; or befo' the waw; or right aftah the waw;
or 'bout two yeahs or five yeahs or ten yeahs befo' the waw or
aftah the waw. It shows how intimately every individual was
visited, in his own person, by that tremendous episode. It gives
the inexperienced stranger a better idea of what a vast and
comprehensive calamity invasion is than he can ever get by
reading books at the fireside.</p>

<a name="455"></a>
<br><br>

<img alt="455.jpg (54K)" src="images/455.jpg" height="621" width="331">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>At a club one evening, a gentleman turned to me and said, in
an aside&mdash;</p>

<p>'You notice, of course, that we are nearly always talking
about the war. It isn't because we haven't anything else to talk
about, but because nothing else has so strong an interest for us.
And there is another reason: In the war, each of us, in his own
person, seems to have sampled all the different varieties of
human experience; as a consequence, you can't mention an outside
matter of any sort but it will certainly remind some listener of
something that happened during the war&mdash;and out he comes with it.
Of course that brings the talk back to the war. You may try all
you want to, to keep other subjects before the house, and we may
all join in and help, but there can be but one result: the most
random topic would load every man up with war reminiscences, and
shut him up, too; and talk would be likely to stop presently,
because you can't talk pale inconsequentialities when you've got
a crimson fact or fancy in your head that you are burning to
fetch out.'</p>

<p>The poet was sitting some little distance away; and presently
he began to speak&mdash;about the moon.</p>

<p>The gentleman who had been talking to me remarked in an
'aside:' 'There, the moon is far enough from the seat of war, but
you will see that it will suggest something to somebody about the
war; in ten minutes from now the moon, as a topic, will be
shelved.'</p>

<p>The poet was saying he had noticed something which was a
surprise to him; had had the impression that down here, toward
the equator, the moonlight was much stronger and brighter than up
North; had had the impression that when he visited New Orleans,
many years ago, the moon&mdash;</p>

<p>Interruption from the other end of the room&mdash;</p>

<p>'Let me explain that. Reminds me of an anecdote. Everything is
changed since the war, for better or for worse; but you'll find
people down here born grumblers, who see no change except the
change for the worse. There was an old negro woman of this sort.
A young New-Yorker said in her presence, "What a wonderful moon
you have down here!" She sighed and said, "Ah, bless yo' heart,
honey, you ought to seen dat moon befo' de waw!"'</p>

<p>The new topic was dead already. But the poet resurrected it,
and gave it a new start.</p>

<p>A brief dispute followed, as to whether the difference between
Northern and Southern moonlight really existed or was only
imagined. Moonlight talk drifted easily into talk about
artificial methods of dispelling darkness. Then somebody
remembered that when Farragut advanced upon Port Hudson on a dark
night&mdash;and did not wish to assist the aim of the Confederate
gunners&mdash;he carried no battle-lanterns, but painted the decks of
his ships white, and thus created a dim but valuable light, which
enabled his own men to grope their way around with considerable
facility. At this point the war got the floor again&mdash;the ten
minutes not quite up yet.</p>

<p>I was not sorry, for war talk by men who have been in a war is
always interesting; whereas moon talk by a poet who has not been
in the moon is likely to be dull.</p>

<p>We went to a cockpit in New Orleans on a Saturday afternoon. I
had never seen a cock-fight before. There were men and boys there
of all ages and all colors, and of many languages and
nationalities. But I noticed one quite conspicuous and surprising
absence: the traditional brutal faces. There were no brutal
faces. With no cock-fighting going on, you could have played the
gathering on a stranger for a prayer-meeting; and after it began,
for a revival&mdash;provided you blindfolded your stranger&mdash;for the
shouting was something prodigious.</p>

<a name="457"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="457.jpg (89K)" src="images/457.jpg" height="527" width="554">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>A negro and a white man were in the ring; everybody else
outside. The cocks were brought in in sacks; and when time was
called, they were taken out by the two bottle-holders, stroked,
caressed, poked toward each other, and finally liberated. The big
black cock plunged instantly at the little gray one and struck
him on the head with his spur. The gray responded with spirit.
Then the Babel of many-tongued shoutings broke out, and ceased
not thenceforth. When the cocks had been fighting some little
time, I was expecting them momently to drop dead, for both were
blind, red with blood, and so exhausted that they frequently fell
down. Yet they would not give up, neither would they die. The
negro and the white man would pick them up every few seconds,
wipe them off, blow cold water on them in a fine spray, and take
their heads in their mouths and hold them there a moment&mdash;to warm
back the perishing life perhaps; I do not know. Then, being set
down again, the dying creatures would totter gropingly about,
with dragging wings, find each other, strike a guesswork blow or
two, and fall exhausted once more.</p>

<p>I did not see the end of the battle. I forced myself to endure
it as long as I could, but it was too pitiful a sight; so I made
frank confession to that effect, and we retired. We heard
afterward that the black cock died in the ring, and fighting to
the last.</p>

<p>Evidently there is abundant fascination about this 'sport' for
such as have had a degree of familiarity with it. I never saw
people enjoy anything more than this gathering enjoyed this
fight. The case was the same with old gray-heads and with boys of
ten. They lost themselves in frenzies of delight. The
'cocking-main' is an inhuman sort of entertainment, there is no
question about that; still, it seems a much more respectable and
far less cruel sport than fox-hunting&mdash;for the cocks like it;
they experience, as well as confer enjoyment; which is not the
fox's case.</p>

<p>We assisted&mdash;in the French sense&mdash;at a mule race, one day. I
believe I enjoyed this contest more than any other mule there. I
enjoyed it more than I remember having enjoyed any other animal
race I ever saw. The grand-stand was well filled with the beauty
and the chivalry of New Orleans. That phrase is not original with
me. It is the Southern reporter's. He has used it for two
generations. He uses it twenty times a day, or twenty thousand
times a day; or a million times a day&mdash;according to the
exigencies. He is obliged to use it a million times a day, if he
have occasion to speak of respectable men and women that often;
for he has no other phrase for such service except that single
one. He never tires of it; it always has a fine sound to him.
There is a kind of swell medieval bulliness and tinsel about it
that pleases his gaudy barbaric soul. If he had been in Palestine
in the early times, we should have had no references to 'much
people' out of him. No, he would have said 'the beauty and the
chivalry of Galilee' assembled to hear the Sermon on the Mount.
It is likely that the men and women of the South are sick enough
of that phrase by this time, and would like a change, but there
is no immediate prospect of their getting it.</p>

<p>The New Orleans editor has a strong, compact, direct,
unflowery style; wastes no words, and does not gush. Not so with
his average correspondent. In the Appendix I have quoted a good
letter, penned by a trained hand; but the average correspondent
hurls a style which differs from that. For instance&mdash;</p>

<p>The 'Times-Democrat' sent a relief-steamer up one of the
bayous, last April. This steamer landed at a village, up there
somewhere, and the Captain invited some of the ladies of the
village to make a short trip with him. They accepted and came
aboard, and the steamboat shoved out up the creek. That was all
there was 'to it.' And that is all that the editor of the
'Times-Democrat' would have got out of it. There was nothing in
the thing but statistics, and he would have got nothing else out
of it. He would probably have even tabulated them, partly to
secure perfect clearness of statement, and partly to save space.
But his special correspondent knows other methods of handling
statistics. He just throws off all restraint and wallows in
them&mdash;</p>

<p>'On Saturday, early in the morning, the beauty of the place
graced our cabin, and proud of her fair freight the gallant
little boat glided up the bayou.'</p>

<p>Twenty-two words to say the ladies came aboard and the boat
shoved out up the creek, is a clean waste of ten good words, and
is also destructive of compactness of statement.</p>

<p>The trouble with the Southern reporter is&mdash;Women. They
unsettle him; they throw him off his balance. He is plain, and
sensible, and satisfactory, until a woman heaves in sight. Then
he goes all to pieces; his mind totters, he becomes flowery and
idiotic. From reading the above extract, you would imagine that
this student of Sir Walter Scott is an apprentice, and knows next
to nothing about handling a pen. On the contrary, he furnishes
plenty of proofs, in his long letter, that he knows well enough
how to handle it when the women are not around to give him the
artificial-flower complaint. For instance&mdash;</p>

<p>'At 4 o'clock ominous clouds began to gather in the
south-east, and presently from the Gulf there came a blow which
increased in severity every moment. It was not safe to leave the
landing then, and there was a delay. The oaks shook off long
tresses of their mossy beards to the tugging of the wind, and the
bayou in its ambition put on miniature waves in mocking of much
larger bodies of water. A lull permitted a start, and homewards
we steamed, an inky sky overhead and a heavy wind blowing. As
darkness crept on, there were few on board who did not wish
themselves nearer home.'</p>

<p>There is nothing the matter with that. It is good description,
compactly put. Yet there was great temptation, there, to drop
into lurid writing.</p>

<p>But let us return to the mule. Since I left him, I have
rummaged around and found a full report of the race. In it I find
confirmation of the theory which I broached just now&mdash;namely,
that the trouble with the Southern reporter is Women: Women,
supplemented by Walter Scott and his knights and beauty and
chivalry, and so on. This is an excellent report, as long as the
women stay out of it. But when they intrude, we have this frantic
result&mdash;</p>

<p>'It will be probably a long time before the ladies' stand
presents such a sea of foam-like loveliness as it did yesterday.
The New Orleans women are always charming, but never so much so
as at this time of the year, when in their dainty spring
costumes they bring with them a breath of balmy freshness and an
odor of sanctity unspeakable. The stand was so crowded with them
that, walking at their feet and seeing no possibility of
approach, many a man appreciated as he never did before the
Peri's feeling at the Gates of Paradise, and wondered what was
the priceless boon that would admit him to their sacred presence.
Sparkling on their white-robed breasts or shoulders were the
colors of their favorite knights, and were it not for the fact
that the doughty heroes appeared on unromantic mules, it would
have been easy to imagine one of King Arthur's gala-days.'</p>

<p>There were thirteen mules in the first heat; all sorts of
mules, they were; all sorts of complexions, gaits, dispositions,
aspects. Some were handsome creatures, some were not; some were
sleek, some hadn't had their fur brushed lately; some were
innocently gay and frisky; some were full of malice and all
unrighteousness; guessing from looks, some of them thought the
matter on hand was war, some thought it was a lark, the rest took
it for a religious occasion. And each mule acted according to his
convictions. The result was an absence of harmony well
compensated by a conspicuous presence of variety&mdash;variety of a
picturesque and entertaining sort.</p>

<p>All the riders were young gentlemen in fashionable society. If
the reader has been wondering why it is that the ladies of New
Orleans attend so humble an orgy as a mule-race, the thing is
explained now. It is a fashion-freak; all connected with it are
people of fashion.</p>

<p>It is great fun, and cordially liked. The mule-race is one of
the marked occasions of the year. It has brought some pretty fast
mules to the front. One of these had to be ruled out, because he
was so fast that he turned the thing into a one-mule contest, and
robbed it of one of its best features&mdash;variety. But every now and
then somebody disguises him with a new name and a new complexion,
and rings him in again.</p>

<p>The riders dress in full jockey costumes of bright-colored
silks, satins, and velvets.</p>

<p>The thirteen mules got away in a body, after a couple of false
starts, and scampered off with prodigious spirit. As each mule
and each rider had a distinct opinion of his own as to how the
race ought to be run, and which side of the track was best in
certain circumstances, and how often the track ought to be
crossed, and when a collision ought to be accomplished, and when
it ought to be avoided, these twenty-six conflicting opinions
created a most fantastic and picturesque confusion, and the
resulting spectacle was killingly comical.</p>

<p>Mile heat; time 2:22. Eight of the thirteen mules distanced. I
had a bet on a mule which would have won if the procession had
been reversed. The second heat was good fun; and so was the
'consolation race for beaten mules,' which followed later; but
the first heat was the best in that respect.</p>

<p>I think that much the most enjoyable of all races is a
steamboat race; but, next to that, I prefer the gay and joyous
mule-rush. Two red-hot steamboats raging along, neck-and-neck,
straining every nerve&mdash;that is to say, every rivet in the
boilers&mdash;quaking and shaking and groaning from stem to stern,
spouting white steam from the pipes, pouring black smoke from the
chimneys, raining down sparks, parting the river into long breaks
of hissing foam&mdash;this is sport that makes a body's very liver
curl with enjoyment. A horse-race is pretty tame and colorless in
comparison. Still, a horse-race might be well enough, in its way,
perhaps, if it were not for the tiresome false starts. But then,
nobody is ever killed. At least, nobody was ever killed when I
was at a horse-race. They have been crippled, it is true; but
this is little to the purpose.</p>
