<br>
<h3>Racing Days</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>IT was always the custom for the boats to leave New Orleans
between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. From three
o'clock onward they would be burning rosin and pitch pine (the
sign of preparation), and so one had the picturesque spectacle of
a rank, some two or three miles long, of tall, ascending columns
of coal-black smoke; a colonnade which supported a sable roof of
the same smoke blended together and spreading abroad over the
city. Every outward-bound boat had its flag flying at the
jack-staff, and sometimes a duplicate on the verge staff astern.
Two or three miles of mates were commanding and swearing with
more than usual emphasis; countless processions of freight
barrels and boxes were spinning athwart the levee and flying
aboard the stage-planks, belated passengers were dodging and
skipping among these frantic things, hoping to reach the
forecastle companion way alive, but having their doubts about it;
women with reticules and bandboxes were trying to keep up with
husbands freighted with carpet-sacks and crying babies, and
making a failure of it by losing their heads in the whirl and
roar and general distraction; drays and baggage-vans were
clattering hither and thither in a wild hurry, every now and then
getting blocked and jammed together, and then during ten seconds
one could not see them for the profanity, except vaguely and
dimly; every windlass connected with every forehatch, from one
end of that long array of steamboats to the other, was keeping up
a deafening whiz and whir, lowering freight into the hold, and
the half-naked crews of perspiring negroes that worked them were
roaring such songs as 'De Las' Sack! De Las' Sack!'&mdash;inspired to
unimaginable exaltation by the chaos of turmoil and racket that
was driving everybody else mad.

<p>
By this time the hurricane and
boiler decks of the steamers would be packed and black with
passengers. The 'last bells' would begin to clang, all down the
line, and then the powwow seemed to double; in a moment or two
the final warning came,&mdash;a simultaneous din of Chinese gongs,
with the cry, 'All dat ain't goin', please to git asho'!'&mdash;and
behold, the powwow quadrupled! People came swarming ashore,
overturning excited stragglers that were trying to swarm aboard.
One more moment later a long array of stage-planks was being
hauled in, each with its customary latest passenger clinging to
the end of it with teeth, nails, and everything else, and the
customary latest procrastinator making a wild spring shoreward
over his head.</p>

<p>Now a number of the boats slide backward into the stream,
leaving wide gaps in the serried rank of steamers. Citizens crowd
the decks of boats that are not to go, in order to see the sight.
Steamer after steamer straightens herself up, gathers all her
strength, and presently comes swinging by, under a tremendous
head of steam, with flag flying, black smoke rolling, and her
entire crew of firemen and deck-hands (usually swarthy negroes)
massed together on the forecastle, the best 'voice' in the lot
towering from the midst (being mounted on the capstan), waving
his hat or a flag, and all roaring a mighty chorus, while the
parting cannons boom and the multitudinous spectators swing their
hats and huzza! Steamer after steamer falls into line, and the
stately procession goes winging its flight up the river.</p>

<p>In the old times, whenever two fast boats started out on a
race, with a big crowd of people looking on, it was inspiring to
hear the crews sing, especially if the time were night-fall, and
the forecastle lit up with the red glare of the torch-baskets.
Racing was royal fun. The public always had an idea that racing
was dangerous; whereas the opposite was the case&mdash;that is, after
the laws were passed which restricted each boat to just so many
pounds of steam to the square inch. No engineer was ever sleepy
or careless when his heart was in a race. He was constantly on
the alert, trying gauge-cocks and watching things. The dangerous
place was on slow, plodding boats, where the engineers drowsed
around and allowed chips to get into the 'doctor' and shut off
the water supply from the boilers.</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>In the 'flush times' of steamboating, a race between two
notoriously fleet steamers was an event of vast importance. The
date was set for it several weeks in advance, and from that time
forward, the whole Mississippi Valley was in a state of consuming
excitement. Politics and the weather were dropped, and people
talked only of the coming race. As the time approached, the two
steamers 'stripped' and got ready. Every encumbrance that added
weight, or exposed a resisting surface to wind or water, was
removed, if the boat could possibly do without it. The 'spars,'
and sometimes even their supporting derricks, were sent ashore,
and no means left to set the boat afloat in case she got aground.
When the 'Eclipse' and the 'A. L. Shotwell' ran their great race
many years ago, it was said that pains were taken to scrape the
gilding off the fanciful device which hung between the
'Eclipse's' chimneys, and that for that one trip the captain left
off his kid gloves and had his head shaved. But I always doubted
these things.</p>

<p>If the boat was known to make her best speed when drawing five
and a half feet forward and five feet aft, she was carefully
loaded to that exact figure&mdash;she wouldn't enter a dose of
homoeopathic pills on her manifest after that. Hardly any
passengers were taken, because they not only add weight but they
never will 'trim boat.' They always run to the side when there is
anything to see, whereas a conscientious and experienced
steamboatman would stick to the center of the boat and part his
hair in the middle with a spirit level.</p>

<p>No way-freights and no way-passengers were allowed, for the
racers would stop only at the largest towns, and then it would be
only 'touch and go.' Coal flats and wood flats were contracted
for beforehand, and these were kept ready to hitch on to the
flying steamers at a moment's warning. Double crews were carried,
so that all work could be quickly done.</p>

<p>The chosen date being come, and all things in readiness, the
two great steamers back into the stream, and lie there jockeying
a moment, and apparently watching each other's slightest
movement, like sentient creatures; flags drooping, the pent steam
shrieking through safety-valves, the black smoke rolling and
tumbling from the chimneys and darkening all the air. People,
people everywhere; the shores, the house-tops, the steamboats,
the ships, are packed with them, and you know that the borders of
the broad Mississippi are going to be fringed with humanity
thence northward twelve hundred miles, to welcome these
racers.</p>

<p>Presently tall columns of steam burst from the 'scape-pipes of
both steamers, two guns boom a good-bye, two red-shirted heroes
mounted on capstans wave their small flags above the massed crews
on the forecastles, two plaintive solos linger on the air a few
waiting seconds, two mighty choruses burst forth&mdash;and here they
come! Brass bands bray Hail Columbia, huzza after huzza thunders
from the shores, and the stately creatures go whistling by like
the wind.</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>Those boats will never halt a moment between New Orleans and
St. Louis, except for a second or two at large towns, or to hitch
thirty-cord wood-boats alongside. You should be on board when
they take a couple of those wood-boats in tow and turn a swarm of
men into each; by the time you have wiped your glasses and put
them on, you will be wondering what has become of that wood.</p>

<p>Two nicely matched steamers will stay in sight of each other
day after day. They might even stay side by side, but for the
fact that pilots are not all alike, and the smartest pilots will
win the race. If one of the boats has a 'lightning' pilot, whose
'partner' is a trifle his inferior, you can tell which one is on
watch by noting whether that boat has gained ground or lost some
during each four-hour stretch. The shrewdest pilot can delay a
boat if he has not a fine genius for steering. Steering is a very
high art. One must not keep a rudder dragging across a boat's
stem if he wants to get up the river fast.</p>

<p>There is a great difference in boats, of course. For a long
time I was on a boat that was so slow we used to forget what year
it was we left port in. But of course this was at rare intervals.
Ferryboats used to lose valuable trips because their passengers
grew old and died, waiting for us to get by. This was at still
rarer intervals. I had the documents for these occurrences, but
through carelessness they have been mislaid. This boat, the 'John
J. Roe,' was so slow that when she finally sunk in Madrid Bend,
it was five years before the owners heard of it. That was always
a confusing fact to me, but it is according to the record, any
way. She was dismally slow; still, we often had pretty exciting
times racing with islands, and rafts, and such things. One trip,
however, we did rather well. We went to St. Louis in sixteen
days. But even at this rattling gait I think we changed watches
three times in Fort Adams reach, which is five miles long. A
'reach' is a piece of straight river, and of course the current
drives through such a place in a pretty lively way.</p>

<p>That trip we went to Grand Gulf, from New Orleans, in four
days (three hundred and forty miles); the 'Eclipse' and
'Shotwell' did it in one. We were nine days out, in the chute of
63 (seven hundred miles); the 'Eclipse' and 'Shotwell' went there
in two days. Something over a generation ago, a boat called the
'J. M. White' went from New Orleans to Cairo in three days, six
hours, and forty-four minutes. In 1853 the 'Eclipse' made the
same trip in three days, three hours, and twenty
minutes.{footnote [Time disputed. Some authorities add 1 hour and
16 minutes to this.]} In 1870 the 'R. E. Lee' did it in three
days and ONE hour. This last is called the fastest trip on
record. I will try to show that it was not. For this reason: the
distance between New Orleans and Cairo, when the 'J. M. White'
ran it, was about eleven hundred and six miles; consequently her
average speed was a trifle over fourteen miles per hour. In the
'Eclipse's' day the distance between the two ports had become
reduced to one thousand and eighty miles; consequently her
average speed was a shade under fourteen and three-eighths miles
per hour. In the 'R. E. Lee's' time the distance had diminished
to about one thousand and thirty miles; consequently her average
was about fourteen and one-eighth miles per hour. Therefore the
'Eclipse's' was conspicuously the fastest time that has ever been
made.</p>

<br>
<h3>Cut-offs and Stephen</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>THESE dry details are of importance in one particular. They
give me an opportunity of introducing one of the Mississippi's
oddest peculiarities,&mdash;that of shortening its length from time to
time. If you will throw a long, pliant apple-paring over your
shoulder, it will pretty fairly shape itself into an average
section of the Mississippi River; that is, the nine or ten
hundred miles stretching from Cairo, Illinois, southward to New
Orleans, the same being wonderfully crooked, with a brief
straight bit here and there at wide intervals. The two
hundred-mile stretch from Cairo northward to St. Louis is by no
means so crooked, that being a rocky country which the river
cannot cut much.</p>

<p>The water cuts the alluvial banks of the 'lower' river into
deep horseshoe curves; so deep, indeed, that in some places if
you were to get ashore at one extremity of the horseshoe and walk
across the neck, half or three quarters of a mile, you could sit
down and rest a couple of hours while your steamer was coming
around the long elbow, at a speed of ten miles an hour, to take
you aboard again. When the river is rising fast, some scoundrel
whose plantation is back in the country, and therefore of
inferior value, has only to watch his chance, cut a little gutter
across the narrow neck of land some dark night, and turn the
water into it, and in a wonderfully short time a miracle has
happened: to wit, the whole Mississippi has taken possession of
that little ditch, and placed the countryman's plantation on its
bank (quadrupling its value), and that other party's formerly
valuable plantation finds itself away out yonder on a big island;
the old watercourse around it will soon shoal up, boats cannot
approach within ten miles of it, and down goes its value to a
fourth of its former worth. Watches are kept on those narrow
necks, at needful times, and if a man happens to be caught
cutting a ditch across them, the chances are all against his ever
having another opportunity to cut a ditch.</p>

<a name="206"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="206.jpg (58K)" src="images/206.jpg" height="638" width="305">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Pray observe some of the effects of this ditching business.
Once there was a neck opposite Port Hudson, Louisiana, which was
only half a mile across, in its narrowest place. You could walk
across there in fifteen minutes; but if you made the journey
around the cape on a raft, you traveled thirty-five miles to
accomplish the same thing. In 1722 the river darted through that
neck, deserted its old bed, and thus shortened itself thirty-five
miles. In the same way it shortened itself twenty-five miles at
Black Hawk Point in 1699. Below Red River Landing, Raccourci
cut-off was made (forty or fifty years ago, I think). This
shortened the river twenty-eight miles. In our day, if you travel
by river from the southernmost of these three cut-offs to the
northernmost, you go only seventy miles. To do the same thing a
hundred and seventy-six years ago, one had to go a hundred and
fifty-eight miles!&mdash;shortening of eighty-eight miles in that
trifling distance. At some forgotten time in the past, cut-offs
were made above Vidalia, Louisiana; at island 92; at island 84;
and at Hale's Point. These shortened the river, in the aggregate,
seventy-seven miles.</p>

<a name="207"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="207.jpg (103K)" src="images/207.jpg" height="726" width="595">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Since my own day on the Mississippi, cut-offs have been made
at Hurricane Island; at island 100; at Napoleon, Arkansas; at
Walnut Bend; and at Council Bend. These shortened the river, in
the aggregate, sixty-seven miles. In my own time a cut-off was
made at American Bend, which shortened the river ten miles or
more.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Mississippi between Cairo and New Orleans was
twelve hundred and fifteen miles long one hundred and seventy-six
years ago. It was eleven hundred and eighty after the cut-off of
1722. It was one thousand and forty after the American Bend
cut-off. It has lost sixty-seven miles since. Consequently its
length is only nine hundred and seventy-three miles at
present.</p>

<p>Now, if I wanted to be one of those ponderous scientific
people, and 'let on' to prove what had occurred in the remote
past by what had occurred in a given time in the recent past, or
what will occur in the far future by what has occurred in late
years, what an opportunity is here! Geology never had such a
chance, nor such exact data to argue from! Nor 'development of
species,' either! Glacial epochs are great things, but they are
vague&mdash;vague. Please observe:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Lower
Mississippi has shortened itself two hundred and forty-two miles.
That is an average of a trifle over one mile and a third per
year. Therefore, any calm person, who is not blind or idiotic,
can see that in the Old Oolitic Silurian Period,' just a million
years ago next November, the Lower Mississippi River was upwards
of one million three hundred thousand miles long, and stuck out
over the Gulf of Mexico like a fishing-rod. And by the same token
any person can see that seven hundred and forty-two years from
now the Lower Mississippi will be only a mile and three-quarters
long, and Cairo and New Orleans will have joined their streets
together, and be plodding comfortably along under a single mayor
and a mutual board of aldermen. There is something fascinating
about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out
of such a trifling investment of fact.</p>

<p>When the water begins to flow through one of those ditches I
have been speaking of, it is time for the people thereabouts to
move. The water cleaves the banks away like a knife. By the time
the ditch has become twelve or fifteen feet wide, the calamity is
as good as accomplished, for no power on earth can stop it now.
When the width has reached a hundred yards, the banks begin to
peel off in slices half an acre wide. The current flowing around
the bend traveled formerly only five miles an hour; now it is
tremendously increased by the shortening of the distance. I was
on board the first boat that tried to go through the cut-off at
American Bend, but we did not get through. It was toward
midnight, and a wild night it was&mdash;thunder, lightning, and
torrents of rain. It was estimated that the current in the
cut-off was making about fifteen or twenty miles an hour; twelve
or thirteen was the best our boat could do, even in tolerably
slack water, therefore perhaps we were foolish to try the
cut-off. However, Mr. Brown was ambitious, and he kept on trying.
The eddy running up the bank, under the 'point,' was about as
swift as the current out in the middle; so we would go flying up
the shore like a lightning express train, get on a big head of
steam, and 'stand by for a surge' when we struck the current that
was whirling by the point. But all our preparations were useless.
The instant the current hit us it spun us around like a top, the
water deluged the forecastle, and the boat careened so far over
that one could hardly keep his feet. The next instant we were
away down the river, clawing with might and main to keep out of
the woods. We tried the experiment four times. I stood on the
forecastle companion way to see. It was astonishing to observe
how suddenly the boat would spin around and turn tail the moment
she emerged from the eddy and the current struck her nose. The
sounding concussion and the quivering would have been about the
same if she had come full speed against a sand-bank. Under the
lightning flashes one could see the plantation cabins and the
goodly acres tumble into the river; and the crash they made was
not a bad effort at thunder. Once, when we spun around, we only
missed a house about twenty feet, that had a light burning in the
window; and in the same instant that house went overboard. Nobody
could stay on our forecastle; the water swept across it in a
torrent every time we plunged athwart the current. At the end of
our fourth effort we brought up in the woods two miles below the
cut-off; all the country there was overflowed, of course. A day
or two later the cut-off was three-quarters of a mile wide, and
boats passed up through it without much difficulty, and so saved
ten miles.</p>

<br><br>

<p>The old Raccourci cut-off reduced the river's length
twenty-eight miles. There used to be a tradition connected with
it. It was said that a boat came along there in the night and
went around the enormous elbow the usual way, the pilots not
knowing that the cut-off had been made. It was a grisly, hideous
night, and all shapes were vague and distorted. The old bend had
already begun to fill up, and the boat got to running away from
mysterious reefs, and occasionally hitting one. The perplexed
pilots fell to swearing, and finally uttered the entirely
unnecessary wish that they might never get out of that place. As
always happens in such cases, that particular prayer was
answered, and the others neglected. So to this day that phantom
steamer is still butting around in that deserted river, trying to
find her way out. More than one grave watchman has sworn to me
that on drizzly, dismal nights, he has glanced fearfully down
that forgotten river as he passed the head of the island, and
seen the faint glow of the specter steamer's lights drifting
through the distant gloom, and heard the muffled cough of her
'scape-pipes and the plaintive cry of her leadsmen.</p>

<a name="211"></a>

<img alt="211.jpg (134K)" src="images/211.jpg" height="843" width="603">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>In the absence of further statistics, I beg to close this
chapter with one more reminiscence of 'Stephen.'</p>

<p>Most of the captains and pilots held Stephen's note for
borrowed sums, ranging from two hundred and fifty dollars upward.
Stephen never paid one of these notes, but he was very prompt and
very zealous about renewing them every twelve months.</p>

<p>Of course there came a time, at last, when Stephen could no
longer borrow of his ancient creditors; so he was obliged to lie
in wait for new men who did not know him. Such a victim was
good-hearted, simple natured young Yates (I use a fictitious
name, but the real name began, as this one does, with a Y). Young
Yates graduated as a pilot, got a berth, and when the month was
ended and he stepped up to the clerk's office and received his
two hundred and fifty dollars in crisp new bills, Stephen was
there! His silvery tongue began to wag, and in a very little
while Yates's two hundred and fifty dollars had changed hands.
The fact was soon known at pilot headquarters, and the amusement
and satisfaction of the old creditors were large and generous.
But innocent Yates never suspected that Stephen's promise to pay
promptly at the end of the week was a worthless one. Yates called
for his money at the stipulated time; Stephen sweetened him up
and put him off a week. He called then, according to agreement,
and came away sugar-coated again, but suffering under another
postponement. So the thing went on. Yates haunted Stephen week
after week, to no purpose, and at last gave it up. And then
straightway Stephen began to haunt Yates! Wherever Yates
appeared, there was the inevitable Stephen. And not only there,
but beaming with affection and gushing with apologies for not
being able to pay. By and by, whenever poor Yates saw him coming,
he would turn and fly, and drag his company with him, if he had
company; but it was of no use; his debtor would run him down and
corner him. Panting and red-faced, Stephen would come, with
outstretched hands and eager eyes, invade the conversation, shake
both of Yates's arms loose in their sockets, and begin&mdash;</p>

<p>'My, what a race I've had! I saw you didn't see me, and so I
clapped on all steam for fear I'd miss you entirely. And here you
are! there, just stand so, and let me look at you! just the same
old noble countenance.' [To Yates's friend:] 'Just look at him!
LOOK at him! Ain't it just GOOD to look at him! AIN'T it now?
Ain't he just a picture! SOME call him a picture; I call him a
panorama! That's what he is&mdash;an entire panorama. And now I'm
reminded! How I do wish I could have seen you an hour earlier!
For twenty-four hours I've been saving up that two hundred and
fifty dollars for you; been looking for you everywhere. I waited
at the Planter's from six yesterday evening till two o'clock this
morning, without rest or food; my wife says, "Where have you been
all night?" I said, "This debt lies heavy on my mind." She says,
"In all my days I never saw a man take a debt to heart the way
you do." I said, "It's my nature; how can I change it?" She says,
"Well, do go to bed and get some rest." I said, "Not till that
poor, noble young man has got his money." So I set up all night,
and this morning out I shot, and the first man I struck told me
you had shipped on the "Grand Turk" and gone to New Orleans.
Well, sir, I had to lean up against a building and cry. So help
me goodness, I couldn't help it. The man that owned the place
come out cleaning up with a rag, and said he didn't like to have
people cry against his building, and then it seemed to me that
the whole world had turned against me, and it wasn't any use to
live any more; and coming along an hour ago, suffering no man
knows what agony, I met Jim Wilson and paid him the two hundred
and fifty dollars on account; and to think that here you are,
now, and I haven't got a cent! But as sure as I am standing here
on this ground on this particular brick,&mdash;there, I've scratched a
mark on the brick to remember it by,&mdash;I'll borrow that money and
pay it over to you at twelve o'clock sharp, tomorrow! Now, stand
so; let me look at you just once more.'</p>

<p>And so on. Yates's life became a burden to him. He could not
escape his debtor and his debtor's awful sufferings on account of
not being able to pay. He dreaded to show himself in the street,
lest he should find Stephen lying in wait for him at the
corner.</p>

<p>Bogart's billiard saloon was a great resort for pilots in
those days. They met there about as much to exchange river news
as to play. One morning Yates was there; Stephen was there, too,
but kept out of sight. But by and by, when about all the pilots
had arrived who were in town, Stephen suddenly appeared in the
midst, and rushed for Yates as for a long-lost brother.</p>

<p>'OH, I am so glad to see you! Oh my soul, the sight of you is
such a comfort to my eyes! Gentlemen, I owe all of you money;
among you I owe probably forty thousand dollars. I want to pay
it; I intend to pay it every last cent of it. You all know,
without my telling you, what sorrow it has cost me to remain so
long under such deep obligations to such patient and generous
friends; but the sharpest pang I suffer&mdash;by far the sharpest&mdash;is
from the debt I owe to this noble young man here; and I have come
to this place this morning especially to make the announcement
that I have at last found a method whereby I can pay off all my
debts! And most especially I wanted HIM to be here when I
announced it. Yes, my faithful friend,&mdash;my benefactor, I've found
the method! I've found the method to pay off all my debts, and
you'll get your money!' Hope dawned in Yates's eye; then Stephen,
beaming benignantly, and placing his hand upon Yates's head,
added, 'I am going to pay them off in alphabetical order!'</p>

<br><br>

<p>Then he turned and disappeared. The full significance of
Stephen's 'method' did not dawn upon the perplexed and musing
crowd for some two minutes; and then Yates murmured with a
sigh&mdash;</p>

<p>'Well, the Y's stand a gaudy chance. He won't get any further
than the C's in THIS world, and I reckon that after a good deal
of eternity has wasted away in the next one, I'll still be
referred to up there as "that poor, ragged pilot that came here
from St. Louis in the early days!"</p>

<br>
<h3>I Take a Few Extra Lessons</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>DURING the two or two and a half years of my apprenticeship, I
served under many pilots, and had experience of many kinds of
steamboatmen and many varieties of steamboats; for it was not
always convenient for Mr. Bixby to have me with him, and in such
cases he sent me with somebody else. I am to this day profiting
somewhat by that experience; for in that brief, sharp schooling,
I got personally and familiarly acquainted with about all the
different types of human nature that are to be found in fiction,
biography, or history. The fact is daily borne in upon me, that
the average shore-employment requires as much as forty years to
equip a man with this sort of an education. When I say I am still
profiting by this thing, I do not mean that it has constituted me
a judge of men&mdash;no, it has not done that; for judges of men are
born, not made. My profit is various in kind and degree; but the
feature of it which I value most is the zest which that early
experience has given to my later reading. When I find a
well-drawn character in fiction or biography, I generally take a
warm personal interest in him, for the reason that I have known
him before&mdash;met him on the river.</p>

<p>The figure that comes before me oftenest, out of the shadows
of that vanished time, is that of Brown, of the steamer
'Pennsylvania'&mdash;the man referred to in a former chapter, whose
memory was so good and tiresome. He was a middle-aged, long,
slim, bony, smooth-shaven, horse-faced, ignorant, stingy,
malicious, snarling, fault hunting, mote-magnifying tyrant. I
early got the habit of coming on watch with dread at my heart. No
matter how good a time I might have been having with the
off-watch below, and no matter how high my spirits might be when
I started aloft, my soul became lead in my body the moment I
approached the pilot-house.</p>

<a name="218"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="218.jpg (37K)" src="images/218.jpg" height="595" width="249">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>I still remember the first time I ever entered the presence of
that man. The boat had backed out from St. Louis and was
'straightening down;' I ascended to the pilot-house in high
feather, and very proud to be semi-officially a member of the
executive family of so fast and famous a boat. Brown was at the
wheel. I paused in the middle of the room, all fixed to make my
bow, but Brown did not look around. I thought he took a furtive
glance at me out of the corner of his eye, but as not even this
notice was repeated, I judged I had been mistaken. By this time
he was picking his way among some dangerous 'breaks' abreast the
woodyards; therefore it would not be proper to interrupt him; so
I stepped softly to the high bench and took a seat.</p>

<p>There was silence for ten minutes; then my new boss turned and
inspected me deliberately and painstakingly from head to heel for
about&mdash;as it seemed to me&mdash;a quarter of an hour. After which he
removed his countenance and I saw it no more for some seconds;
then it came around once more, and this question greeted me&mdash;</p>

<p>'Are you Horace Bigsby's cub?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>After this there was a pause and another inspection.
Then&mdash;</p>

<a name="219"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="219.jpg (109K)" src="images/219.jpg" height="712" width="600">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>'What's your name?'</p>

<p>I told him. He repeated it after me. It was probably the only
thing he ever forgot; for although I was with him many months he
never addressed himself to me in any other way than 'Here!' and
then his command followed.</p>

<p>'Where was you born?'</p>

<p>'In Florida, Missouri.'</p>

<p>A pause. Then&mdash;</p>

<p>'Dern sight better staid there!'</p>

<p>By means of a dozen or so of pretty direct questions, he
pumped my family history out of me.</p>

<p>The leads were going now, in the first crossing. This
interrupted the inquest. When the leads had been laid in, he
resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>'How long you been on the river?'</p>

<p>I told him. After a pause&mdash;</p>

<p>'Where'd you get them shoes?'</p>

<p>I gave him the information.</p>

<p>'Hold up your foot!'</p>

<p>I did so. He stepped back, examined the shoe minutely and
contemptuously, scratching his head thoughtfully, tilting his
high sugar-loaf hat well forward to facilitate the operation,
then ejaculated, 'Well, I'll be dod derned!' and returned to his
wheel.</p>

<a name="220"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="220.jpg (78K)" src="images/220.jpg" height="802" width="353">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>What occasion there was to be dod derned about it is a thing
which is still as much of a mystery to me now as it was then. It
must have been all of fifteen minutes&mdash;fifteen minutes of dull,
homesick silence&mdash;before that long horse-face swung round upon
me again&mdash;and then, what a change! It was as red as fire, and
every muscle in it was working. Now came this shriek&mdash;</p>

<a name="221"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="221.jpg (140K)" src="images/221.jpg" height="963" width="589">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>'Here!&mdash;You going to set there all day?'</p>

<p>I lit in the middle of the floor, shot there by the electric
suddenness of the surprise. As soon as I could get my voice I
said, apologetically:&mdash;'I have had no orders, sir.'</p>

<p>'You've had no ORDERS! My, what a fine bird we are! We must
have ORDERS! Our father was a GENTLEMAN&mdash;owned slaves&mdash;and we've
been to SCHOOL. Yes, WE are a gentleman, TOO, and got to have
ORDERS! ORDERS, is it? ORDERS is what you want! Dod dern my skin,
I'LL learn you to swell yourself up and blow around here about
your dod-derned ORDERS! G'way from the wheel!' (I had approached
it without knowing it.)</p>

<p>I moved back a step or two, and stood as in a dream, all my
senses stupefied by this frantic assault.</p>

<p>'What you standing there for? Take that ice-pitcher down to
the texas-tender-come, move along, and don't you be all day
about it!'</p>

<p>The moment I got back to the pilot-house, Brown said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Here! What was you doing down there all this time?'</p>

<p>'I couldn't find the texas-tender; I had to go all the way to
the pantry.'</p>

<p>'Derned likely story! Fill up the stove.'</p>

<p>I proceeded to do so. He watched me like a cat. Presently he
shouted&mdash;</p>

<a name="222"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="222.jpg (101K)" src="images/222.jpg" height="775" width="590">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>'Put down that shovel! Deadest numskull I ever saw&mdash;ain't even
got sense enough to load up a stove.'</p>

<p>All through the watch this sort of thing went on. Yes, and the
subsequent watches were much like it, during a stretch of months.
As I have said, I soon got the habit of coming on duty with
dread. The moment I was in the presence, even in the darkest
night, I could feel those yellow eyes upon me, and knew their
owner was watching for a pretext to spit out some venom on me.
Preliminarily he would say&mdash;</p>

<p>'Here! Take the wheel.'</p>

<p>Two minutes later&mdash;</p>

<p>'WHERE in the nation you going to? Pull her down! pull her
down!'</p>

<p>After another moment&mdash;</p>

<p>'Say! You going to hold her all day? Let her go&mdash;meet her!
meet her!'</p>

<p>Then he would jump from the bench, snatch the wheel from me,
and meet her himself, pouring out wrath upon me all the time.</p>

<p>George Ritchie was the other pilot's cub. He was having good
times now; for his boss, George Ealer, was as kindhearted as
Brown wasn't. Ritchie had steeled for Brown the season before;
consequently he knew exactly how to entertain himself and plague
me, all by the one operation. Whenever I took the wheel for a
moment on Ealer's watch, Ritchie would sit back on the bench and
play Brown, with continual ejaculations of 'Snatch her! snatch
her! Derndest mud-cat I ever saw!' 'Here! Where you going NOW?
Going to run over that snag?' 'Pull her DOWN! Don't you hear me?
Pull her DOWN!' 'There she goes! JUST as I expected! I TOLD you
not to cramp that reef. G'way from the wheel!'</p>

<p>So I always had a rough time of it, no matter whose watch it
was; and sometimes it seemed to me that Ritchie's good-natured
badgering was pretty nearly as aggravating as Brown's
dead-earnest nagging.</p>

<p>I often wanted to kill Brown, but this would not answer. A cub
had to take everything his boss gave, in the way of vigorous
comment and criticism; and we all believed that there was a
United States law making it a penitentiary offense to strike or
threaten a pilot who was on duty. However, I could IMAGINE myself
killing Brown; there was no law against that; and that was the
thing I used always to do the moment I was abed. Instead of going
over my river in my mind as was my duty, I threw business aside
for pleasure, and killed Brown. I killed Brown every night for
months; not in old, stale, commonplace ways, but in new and
picturesque ones;&mdash;ways that were sometimes surprising for
freshness of design and ghastliness of situation and
environment.</p>

</center>
<br><br>

<p>Brown was ALWAYS watching for a pretext to find fault; and if
he could find no plausible pretext, he would invent one. He would
scold you for shaving a shore, and for not shaving it; for
hugging a bar, and for not hugging it; for 'pulling down' when
not invited, and for not pulling down when not invited; for
firing up without orders, and for waiting FOR orders. In a word,
it was his invariable rule to find fault with EVERYTHING you did;
and another invariable rule of his was to throw all his remarks
(to you) into the form of an insult.</p>

<p>One day we were approaching New Madrid, bound down and heavily
laden. Brown was at one side of the wheel, steering; I was at the
other, standing by to 'pull down' or 'shove up.' He cast a
furtive glance at me every now and then. I had long ago learned
what that meant; viz., he was trying to invent a trap for me. I
wondered what shape it was going to take. By and by he stepped
back from the wheel and said in his usual snarly way&mdash;</p>

<p>'Here!&mdash;See if you've got gumption enough to round her
to.'</p>

<p>This was simply BOUND to be a success; nothing could prevent
it; for he had never allowed me to round the boat to before;
consequently, no matter how I might do the thing, he could find
free fault with it. He stood back there with his greedy eye on
me, and the result was what might have been foreseen: I lost my
head in a quarter of a minute, and didn't know what I was about;
I started too early to bring the boat around, but detected a
green gleam of joy in Brown's eye, and corrected my mistake; I
started around once more while too high up, but corrected myself
again in time; I made other false moves, and still managed to
save myself; but at last I grew so confused and anxious that I
tumbled into the very worst blunder of all&mdash;I got too far down
before beginning to fetch the boat around. Brown's chance was
come.</p>

<a name="225"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="225.jpg (120K)" src="images/225.jpg" height="768" width="594">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>His face turned red with passion; he made one bound, hurled me
across the house with a sweep of his arm, spun the wheel down,
and began to pour out a stream of vituperation upon me which
lasted till he was out of breath. In the course of this speech he
called me all the different kinds of hard names he could think
of, and once or twice I thought he was even going to swear&mdash;but
he didn't this time. 'Dod dern' was the nearest he ventured to
the luxury of swearing, for he had been brought up with a
wholesome respect for future fire and brimstone.</p>

<p>That was an uncomfortable hour; for there was a big audience
on the hurricane deck. When I went to bed that night, I killed
Brown in seventeen different ways&mdash;all of them new.</p>

<br>
<h3>Brown and I Exchange Compliments</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>Two trips later, I got into serious trouble. Brown was
steering; I was 'pulling down.' My younger brother appeared on
the hurricane deck, and shouted to Brown to stop at some landing
or other a mile or so below. Brown gave no intimation that he had
heard anything. But that was his way: he never condescended to
take notice of an under clerk. The wind was blowing; Brown was
deaf (although he always pretended he wasn't), and I very much
doubted if he had heard the order. If I had two heads, I would
have spoken; but as I had only one, it seemed judicious to take
care of it; so I kept still.</p>

<p>Presently, sure enough, we went sailing by that plantation.
Captain Klinefelter appeared on the deck, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Let her come around, sir, let her come around. Didn't Henry
tell you to land here?'</p>

<p>'NO, sir!'</p>

<p>'I sent him up to do, it.'</p>

<p>'He did come up; and that's all the good it done, the
dod-derned fool. He never said anything.'</p>

<p>'Didn't YOU hear him?' asked the captain of me.</p>

<p>Of course I didn't want to be mixed up in this business, but
there was no way to avoid it; so I said&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>I knew what Brown's next remark would be, before he uttered
it; it was&mdash;</p>

<p>'Shut your mouth! you never heard anything of the kind.'</p>

<p>I closed my mouth according to instructions. An hour later,
Henry entered the pilot-house, unaware of what had been going on.
He was a thoroughly inoffensive boy, and I was sorry to see him
come, for I knew Brown would have no pity on him. Brown began,
straightway&mdash;</p>

<p>'Here! why didn't you tell me we'd got to land at that
plantation?'</p>

<p>'I did tell you, Mr. Brown.'</p>

<p>'It's a lie!'</p>

<p>I said&mdash;</p>

<p>'You lie, yourself. He did tell you.'</p>

<p>Brown glared at me in unaffected surprise; and for as much as
a moment he was entirely speechless; then he shouted to me&mdash;</p>

<p>'I'll attend to your case in half a minute!' then to Henry,
'And you leave the pilot-house; out with you!'</p>

<p>It was pilot law, and must be obeyed. The boy started out, and
even had his foot on the upper step outside the door, when Brown,
with a sudden access of fury, picked up a ten-pound lump of coal
and sprang after him; but I was between, with a heavy stool, and
I hit Brown a good honest blow which stretched-him out.</p>

<a name="229"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="229.jpg (138K)" src="images/229.jpg" height="880" width="542">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>I had committed the crime of crimes&mdash;I had lifted my hand
against a pilot on duty! I supposed I was booked for the
penitentiary sure, and couldn't be booked any surer if I went on
and squared my long account with this person while I had the
chance; consequently I stuck to him and pounded him with my fists
a considerable time&mdash;I do not know how long, the pleasure of it
probably made it seem longer than it really was;&mdash;but in the end
he struggled free and jumped up and sprang to the wheel: a very
natural solicitude, for, all this time, here was this steamboat
tearing down the river at the rate of fifteen miles an hour and
nobody at the helm! However, Eagle Bend was two miles wide at
this bank-full stage, and correspondingly long and deep; and the
boat was steering herself straight down the middle and taking no
chances. Still, that was only luck&mdash;a body MIGHT have found her
charging into the woods.</p>

<a name="231"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="231.jpg (89K)" src="images/231.jpg" height="559" width="611">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Perceiving, at a glance, that the 'Pennsylvania' was in no
danger, Brown gathered up the big spy-glass, war-club fashion,
and ordered me out of the pilot-house with more than Comanche
bluster. But I was not afraid of him now; so, instead of going, I
tarried, and criticized his grammar; I reformed his ferocious
speeches for him, and put them into good English, calling his
attention to the advantage of pure English over the bastard
dialect of the Pennsylvanian collieries whence he was extracted.
He could have done his part to admiration in a cross-fire of mere
vituperation, of course; but he was not equipped for this species
of controversy; so he presently laid aside his glass and took the
wheel, muttering and shaking his head; and I retired to the
bench. The racket had brought everybody to the hurricane deck,
and I trembled when I saw the old captain looking up from the
midst of the crowd. I said to myself, 'Now I AM done for!'&mdash;For
although, as a rule, he was so fatherly and indulgent toward the
boat's family, and so patient of minor shortcomings, he could be
stern enough when the fault was worth it.</p>

<p>I tried to imagine what he WOULD do to a cub pilot who had
been guilty of such a crime as mine, committed on a boat
guard-deep with costly freight and alive with passengers. Our
watch was nearly ended. I thought I would go and hide somewhere
till I got a chance to slide ashore. So I slipped out of the
pilot-house, and down the steps, and around to the texas
door&mdash;and was in the act of gliding within, when the captain
confronted me! I dropped my head, and he stood over me in silence
a moment or two, then said impressively&mdash;</p>

<p>'Follow me.'</p>

<a name="232"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="232.jpg (57K)" src="images/232.jpg" height="577" width="384">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>I dropped into his wake; he led the way to his parlor in the
forward end of the texas. We were alone, now. He closed the after
door; then moved slowly to the forward one and closed that. He
sat down; I stood before him. He looked at me some little time,
then said&mdash;</p>

<p>'So you have been fighting Mr. Brown?'</p>

<p>I answered meekly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Do you know that that is a very serious matter?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Are you aware that this boat was plowing down the river fully
five minutes with no one at the wheel?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Did you strike him first?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'What with?'</p>

<p>'A stool, sir.'</p>

<p>'Hard?'</p>

<p>'Middling, sir.'</p>

<p>'Did it knock him down?'</p>

<p>'He&mdash;he fell, sir.'</p>

<p>'Did you follow it up? Did you do anything further?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'What did you do?'</p>

<p>'Pounded him, sir.'</p>

<p>'Pounded him?'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>

<p>'Did you pound him much?&mdash;that is, severely?'</p>

<p>'One might call it that, sir, maybe.'</p>

<p>'I'm deuced glad of it! Hark ye, never mention that I said
that. You have been guilty of a great crime; and don't you ever
be guilty of it again, on this boat. BUT&mdash;lay for him ashore!
Give him a good sound thrashing, do you hear? I'll pay the
expenses. Now go&mdash;and mind you, not a word of this to anybody.
Clear out with you!&mdash;you've been guilty of a great crime, you
whelp!'</p>

<p>I slid out, happy with the sense of a close shave and a mighty
deliverance; and I heard him laughing to himself and slapping his
fat thighs after I had closed his door.</p>

<p>When Brown came off watch he went straight to the captain, who
was talking with some passengers on the boiler deck, and demanded
that I be put ashore in New Orleans&mdash;and added&mdash;</p>

<p>'I'll never turn a wheel on this boat again while that cub

<p>The captain said&mdash;</p>

<p>'But he needn't come round when you are on watch, Mr.
Brown.</p>

<p>'I won't even stay on the same boat with him. One of us has
got to go ashore.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' said the captain, 'let it be yourself;' and
resumed his talk with the passengers.</p>

<p>During the brief remainder of the trip, I knew how an
emancipated slave feels; for I was an emancipated slave myself.
While we lay at landings, I listened to George Ealer's flute; or
to his readings from his two bibles, that is to say, Goldsmith
and Shakespeare; or I played chess with him&mdash;and would have
beaten him sometimes, only he always took back his last move and
ran the game out differently.</p>

<br>
<h3>A Catastrophe</h3>
</center>
<br>

<p>WE lay three days in New Orleans, but the captain did not
succeed in finding another pilot; so he proposed that I should
stand a daylight watch, and leave the night watches to George
Ealer. But I was afraid; I had never stood a watch of any sort by
myself, and I believed I should be sure to get into trouble in
the head of some chute, or ground the boat in a near cut through
some bar or other. Brown remained in his place; but he would not
travel with me. So the captain gave me an order on the captain of
the 'A. T. Lacey,' for a passage to St. Louis, and said he would
find a new pilot there and my steersman's berth could then be
resumed. The 'Lacey' was to leave a couple of days after the
'Pennsylvania.'</p>

<p>The night before the 'Pennsylvania' left, Henry and I sat
chatting on a freight pile on the levee till midnight. The
subject of the chat, mainly, was one which I think we had not
exploited before&mdash;steamboat disasters. One was then on its way to
us, little as we suspected it; the water which was to make the
steam which should cause it, was washing past some point fifteen
hundred miles up the river while we talked;&mdash;but it would arrive
at the right time and the right place. We doubted if persons not
clothed with authority were of much use in cases of disaster and
attendant panic; still, they might be of SOME use; so we decided
that if a disaster ever fell within our experience we would at
least stick to the boat, and give such minor service as chance
might throw in the way. Henry remembered this, afterward, when
the disaster came, and acted accordingly.</p>

<p>The 'Lacey' started up the river two days behind the
'Pennsylvania.' We touched at Greenville, Mississippi, a couple
of days out, and somebody shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>'The "Pennsylvania" is blown up at Ship Island, and a hundred
and fifty lives lost!'</p>

<p>At Napoleon, Arkansas, the same evening, we got an extra,
issued by a Memphis paper, which gave some particulars. It
mentioned my brother, and said he was not hurt.</p>

<p>Further up the river we got a later extra. My brother was
again mentioned; but this time as being hurt beyond help. We did
not get full details of the catastrophe until we reached Memphis.
This is the sorrowful story&mdash;</p>

<br><br>

<p>It was six o'clock on a hot summer morning. The 'Pennsylvania'
was creeping along, north of Ship Island, about sixty miles below
Memphis on a half-head of steam, towing a wood-flat which was
fast being emptied. George Ealer was in the pilot-house-alone, I
think; the second engineer and a striker had the watch in the
engine room; the second mate had the watch on deck; George Black,
Mr. Wood, and my brother, clerks, were asleep, as were also Brown
and the head engineer, the carpenter, the chief mate, and one
striker; Captain Klinefelter was in the barber's chair, and the
barber was preparing to shave him. There were a good many cabin
passengers aboard, and three or four hundred deck passengers&mdash;so
it was said at the time&mdash;and not very many of them were astir.
The wood being nearly all out of the flat now, Ealer rang to
'come ahead' full steam, and the next moment four of the eight
boilers exploded with a thunderous crash, and the whole forward
third of the boat was hoisted toward the sky! The main part of
the mass, with the chimneys, dropped upon the boat again, a
mountain of riddled and chaotic rubbish&mdash;and then, after a
little, fire broke out.</p>

<a name="239"></a>
<br><br>

<img alt="239.jpg (174K)" src="images/239.jpg" height="1008" width="636">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>Many people were flung to considerable distances, and fell in
the river; among these were Mr. Wood and my brother, and the
carpenter. The carpenter was still stretched upon his mattress
when he struck the water seventy-five feet from the boat. Brown,
the pilot, and George Black, chief clerk, were never seen or
heard of after the explosion. The barber's chair, with Captain
Klinefelter in it and unhurt, was left with its back overhanging
vacancy&mdash;everything forward of it, floor and all, had
disappeared; and the stupefied barber, who was also unhurt, stood
with one toe projecting over space, still stirring his lather
unconsciously, and saying, not a word.</p>

<p>When George Ealer saw the chimneys plunging aloft in front of
him, he knew what the matter was; so he muffled his face in the
lapels of his coat, and pressed both hands there tightly to keep
this protection in its place so that no steam could get to his
nose or mouth. He had ample time to attend to these details while
he was going up and returning. He presently landed on top of the
unexploded boilers, forty feet below the former pilot-house,
accompanied by his wheel and a rain of other stuff, and enveloped
in a cloud of scalding steam. All of the many who breathed that
steam, died; none escaped. But Ealer breathed none of it. He made
his way to the free air as quickly as he could; and when the
steam cleared away he returned and climbed up on the boilers
again, and patiently hunted out each and every one of his
chessmen and the several joints of his flute.</p>

<br><br>

<p>By this time the fire was beginning to threaten. Shrieks and
groans filled the air. A great many persons had been scalded, a
great many crippled; the explosion had driven an iron crowbar
through one man's body&mdash;I think they said he was a priest. He did
not die at once, and his sufferings were very dreadful. A young
French naval cadet, of fifteen, son of a French admiral, was
fearfully scalded, but bore his tortures manfully. Both mates
were badly scalded, but they stood to their posts, nevertheless.
They drew the wood-boat aft, and they and the captain fought back
the frantic herd of frightened immigrants till the wounded could
be brought there and placed in safety first.</p>

<p>When Mr. Wood and Henry fell in the water, they struck out for
shore, which was only a few hundred yards away; but Henry
presently said he believed he was not hurt (what an unaccountable
error!), and therefore would swim back to the boat and help save
the wounded. So they parted, and Henry returned.</p>

<p>By this time the fire was making fierce headway, and several
persons who were imprisoned under the ruins were begging
piteously for help. All efforts to conquer the fire proved
fruitless; so the buckets were presently thrown aside and the
officers fell-to with axes and tried to cut the prisoners out. A
striker was one of the captives; he said he was not injured, but
could not free himself; and when he saw that the fire was likely
to drive away the workers, he begged that some one would shoot
him, and thus save him from the more dreadful death. The fire did
drive the axmen away, and they had to listen, helpless, to this
poor fellow's supplications till the flames ended his
miseries.</p>

<br><br>

<p>The fire drove all into the wood-flat that could be
accommodated there; it was cut adrift, then, and it and the
burning steamer floated down the river toward Ship Island. They
moored the flat at the head of the island, and there, unsheltered
from the blazing sun, the half-naked occupants had to remain,
without food or stimulants, or help for their hurts, during the
rest of the day. A steamer came along, finally, and carried the
unfortunates to Memphis, and there the most lavish assistance was
at once forthcoming. By this time Henry was insensible. The
physicians examined his injuries and saw that they were fatal,
and naturally turned their main attention to patients who could
be saved.</p>

<p>Forty of the wounded were placed upon pallets on the floor of
a great public hall, and among these was Henry. There the ladies
of Memphis came every day, with flowers, fruits, and dainties and
delicacies of all kinds, and there they remained and nursed the
wounded. All the physicians stood watches there, and all the
medical students; and the rest of the town furnished money, or
whatever else was wanted. And Memphis knew how to do all these
things well; for many a disaster like the 'Pennsylvania's' had
happened near her doors, and she was experienced, above all other
cities on the river, in the gracious office of the Good
Samaritan.'</p>

<p>The sight I saw when I entered that large hall was new and
strange to me. Two long rows of prostrate forms&mdash;more than forty,
in all&mdash;and every face and head a shapeless wad of loose raw
cotton. It was a gruesome spectacle. I watched there six days and
nights, and a very melancholy experience it was. There was one
daily incident which was peculiarly depressing: this was the
removal of the doomed to a chamber apart. It was done in order
that the MORALE of the other patients might not be injuriously
affected by seeing one of their number in the death-agony. The
fated one was always carried out with as little stir as possible,
and the stretcher was always hidden from sight by a wall of
assistants; but no matter: everybody knew what that cluster of
bent forms, with its muffled step and its slow movement meant;
and all eyes watched it wistfully, and a shudder went abreast of
it like a wave.</p>

<br><br>

<p>I saw many poor fellows removed to the 'death-room,' and saw
them no more afterward. But I saw our chief mate carried thither
more than once. His hurts were frightful, especially his scalds.
He was clothed in linseed oil and raw cotton to his waist, and
resembled nothing human. He was often out of his mind; and then
his pains would make him rave and shout and sometimes shriek.
Then, after a period of dumb exhaustion, his disordered
imagination would suddenly transform the great apartment into a
forecastle, and the hurrying throng of nurses into the crew; and
he would come to a sitting posture and shout, 'Hump yourselves,
HUMP yourselves, you petrifactions, snail-bellies, pall-bearers!
going to be all DAY getting that hatful of freight out?' and
supplement this explosion with a firmament-obliterating irruption
or profanity which nothing could stay or stop till his crater was
empty. And now and then while these frenzies possessed him, he
would tear off handfuls of the cotton and expose his cooked flesh
to view. It was horrible. It was bad for the others, of
course&mdash;this noise and these exhibitions; so the doctors tried to
give him morphine to quiet him. But, in his mind or out of it, he
would not take it. He said his wife had been killed by that
treacherous drug, and he would die before he would take it. He
suspected that the doctors were concealing it in his ordinary
medicines and in his water&mdash;so he ceased from putting either to
his lips. Once, when he had been without water during two
sweltering days, he took the dipper in his hand, and the sight of
the limpid fluid, and the misery of his thirst, tempted him
almost beyond his strength; but he mastered himself and threw it
away, and after that he allowed no more to be brought near him.
Three times I saw him carried to the death-room, insensible and
supposed to be dying; but each time he revived, cursed his
attendants, and demanded to be taken back. He lived to be mate of
a steamboat again.</p>

<p>But he was the only one who went to the death-room and
returned alive. Dr. Peyton, a principal physician, and rich in
all the attributes that go to constitute high and flawless
character, did all that educated judgment and trained skill could
do for Henry; but, as the newspapers had said in the beginning,
his hurts were past help. On the evening of the sixth day his
wandering mind busied itself with matters far away, and his
nerveless fingers 'picked at his coverlet.' His hour had struck;
we bore him to the death-room, poor boy.</p>
