<p>RESTORATION OF THE FOUNTAIN</p>

<p>Saturday noon I went to the well and looked on a while. &nbsp;Merlin
was still burning smoke-powders, and pawing the air, and muttering
gibberish as hard as ever, but looking pretty down-hearted, for
of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet.
Finally I said:</p>

<p>"How does the thing promise by this time, partner?"</p>

<p>"Behold, I am even now busied with trial of the powerfulest
enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands
of the East; an it fail me, naught can avail. &nbsp;Peace, until I finish."</p>

<p>He raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region, and must
have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits, for the wind
was their way, and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and
billowy fog. &nbsp;He poured out volumes of speech to match, and contorted
his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary
way. &nbsp;At the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting, and
about exhausted. &nbsp;Now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks
and nuns, and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of
acres of foundlings, all drawn by the prodigious smoke, and all
in a grand state of excitement. &nbsp;The abbot inquired anxiously for
results. &nbsp;Merlin said:</p>

<p>"If any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these
waters, this which I have but just essayed had done it. &nbsp;It has
failed; whereby I do now know that that which I had feared is
a truth established; the sign of this failure is, that the most
potent spirit known to the magicians of the East, and whose name
none may utter and live, has laid his spell upon this well. &nbsp;The
mortal does not breathe, nor ever will, who can penetrate the secret
of that spell, and without that secret none can break it. &nbsp;The
water will flow no more forever, good Father. &nbsp;I have done what
man could. &nbsp;Suffer me to go."</p>

<p>Of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation.
He turned to me with the signs of it in his face, and said:</p>

<p>"Ye have heard him. Is it true?"</p>

<p>"Part of it is."</p>

<p>"Not all, then, not all! &nbsp;What part is true?"</p>

<p>"That that spirit with the Russian name has put his spell
upon the well."</p>

<p>"God's wounds, then are we ruined!"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"But not certainly? &nbsp;Ye mean, not certainly?"</p>

<p>"That is it."</p>

<p>"Wherefore, ye also mean that when he saith none can break the spell&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, when he says that, he says what isn't necessarily true.
There are conditions under which an effort to break it may have
some chance&mdash;that is, some small, some trifling chance&mdash;of success."</p>

<p>"The conditions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, they are nothing difficult. &nbsp;Only these: &nbsp;I want the well
and the surroundings for the space of half a mile, entirely to
myself from sunset to-day until I remove the ban&mdash;and nobody
allowed to cross the ground but by my authority."</p>

<p>"Are these all?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you have no fear to try?"</p>

<p>"Oh, none. &nbsp;One may fail, of course; and one may also succeed.
One can try, and I am ready to chance it. &nbsp;I have my conditions?"</p>

<p>"These and all others ye may name. &nbsp;I will issue commandment
to that effect."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Merlin, with an evil smile. &nbsp;"Ye wit that he that
would break this spell must know that spirit's name?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know his name."</p>

<p>"And wit you also that to know it skills not of itself, but ye
must likewise pronounce it? &nbsp;Ha-ha! &nbsp;Knew ye that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew that, too."</p>

<p>"You had that knowledge! &nbsp;Art a fool? &nbsp;Are ye minded to utter
that name and die?"</p>

<p>"Utter it? &nbsp;Why certainly. &nbsp;I would utter it if it was Welsh."</p>

<p>"Ye are even a dead man, then; and I go to tell Arthur."</p>

<p>"That's all right. &nbsp;Take your gripsack and get along. &nbsp;The thing
for <i>you</i>  to do is to go home and work the weather, John W. Merlin."</p>

<p>It was a home shot, and it made him wince; for he was the worst
weather-failure in the kingdom. &nbsp;Whenever he ordered up the
danger-signals along the coast there was a week's dead calm, sure,
and every time he prophesied fair weather it rained brickbats.
But I kept him in the weather bureau right along, to undermine
his reputation. &nbsp;However, that shot raised his bile, and instead
of starting home to report my death, he said he would remain
and enjoy it.</p>

<p>My two experts arrived in the evening, and pretty well fagged,
for they had traveled double tides. &nbsp;They had pack-mules along,
and had brought everything I needed&mdash;tools, pump, lead pipe,
Greek fire, sheaves of big rockets, roman candles, colored fire
sprays, electric apparatus, and a lot of sundries&mdash;everything
necessary for the stateliest kind of a miracle. &nbsp;They got their
supper and a nap, and about midnight we sallied out through a
solitude so wholly vacant and complete that it quite overpassed
the required conditions. &nbsp;We took possession of the well and its
surroundings. &nbsp;My boys were experts in all sorts of things, from
the stoning up of a well to the constructing of a mathematical
instrument. &nbsp;An hour before sunrise we had that leak mended in
ship-shape fashion, and the water began to rise. &nbsp;Then we stowed our
fireworks in the chapel, locked up the place, and went home to bed.</p>

<p>Before the noon mass was over, we were at the well again; for there
was a deal to do yet, and I was determined to spring the miracle
before midnight, for business reasons: &nbsp;for whereas a miracle
worked for the Church on a week-day is worth a good deal, it is
worth six times as much if you get it in on a Sunday. &nbsp;In nine hours
the water had risen to its customary level&mdash;that is to say, it was
within twenty-three feet of the top. &nbsp;We put in a little iron pump,
one of the first turned out by my works near the capital; we bored
into a stone reservoir which stood against the outer wall of the
well-chamber and inserted a section of lead pipe that was long
enough to reach to the door of the chapel and project beyond
the threshold, where the gushing water would be visible to the
two hundred and fifty acres of people I was intending should be
present on the flat plain in front of this little holy hillock at
the proper time.</p>

<p>We knocked the head out of an empty hogshead and hoisted this
hogshead to the flat roof of the chapel, where we clamped it down
fast, poured in gunpowder till it lay loosely an inch deep on the
bottom, then we stood up rockets in the hogshead as thick as they
could loosely stand, all the different breeds of rockets there are;
and they made a portly and imposing sheaf, I can tell you. &nbsp;We
grounded the wire of a pocket electrical battery in that powder,
we placed a whole magazine of Greek fire on each corner of the
roof&mdash;blue on one corner, green on another, red on another, and
purple on the last&mdash;and grounded a wire in each.</p>

<p>About two hundred yards off, in the flat, we built a pen of
scantlings, about four feet high, and laid planks on it, and so
made a platform. &nbsp;We covered it with swell tapestries borrowed
for the occasion, and topped it off with the abbot's own throne.
When you are going to do a miracle for an ignorant race, you want
to get in every detail that will count; you want to make all the
properties impressive to the public eye; you want to make matters
comfortable for your head guest; then you can turn yourself loose
and play your effects for all they are worth. &nbsp;I know the value of
these things, for I know human nature. &nbsp;You can't throw too much
style into a miracle. &nbsp;It costs trouble, and work, and sometimes
money; but it pays in the end. &nbsp;Well, we brought the wires to
the ground at the chapel, and then brought them under the ground
to the platform, and hid the batteries there. &nbsp;We put a rope fence
a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common
multitude, and that finished the work. &nbsp;My idea was, doors open
at 10:30, performance to begin at 11:25 sharp. &nbsp;I wished I could
charge admission, but of course that wouldn't answer. &nbsp;I instructed
my boys to be in the chapel as early as 10, before anybody was
around, and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time, and
make the fur fly. &nbsp;Then we went home to supper.</p>

<p>The news of the disaster to the well had traveled far by this time;
and now for two or three days a steady avalanche of people had
been pouring into the valley. &nbsp;The lower end of the valley was
become one huge camp; we should have a good house, no question
about that. &nbsp;Criers went the rounds early in the evening and
announced the coming attempt, which put every pulse up to fever
heat. &nbsp;They gave notice that the abbot and his official suite would
move in state and occupy the platform at 10:30, up to which time
all the region which was under my ban must be clear; the bells
would then cease from tolling, and this sign should be permission
to the multitudes to close in and take their places.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>I was at the platform and all ready to do the honors when the
abbot's solemn procession hove in sight&mdash;which it did not do till
it was nearly to the rope fence, because it was a starless black
night and no torches permitted. &nbsp;With it came Merlin, and took
a front seat on the platform; he was as good as his word for once.
One could not see the multitudes banked together beyond the ban,
but they were there, just the same. &nbsp;The moment the bells stopped,
those banked masses broke and poured over the line like a vast
black wave, and for as much as a half hour it continued to flow,
and then it solidified itself, and you could have walked upon
a pavement of human heads to&mdash;well, miles.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>We had a solemn stage-wait, now, for about twenty minutes&mdash;a thing
I had counted on for effect; it is always good to let your audience
have a chance to work up its expectancy. &nbsp;At length, out of the
silence a noble Latin chant&mdash;men's voices&mdash;broke and swelled up
and rolled away into the night, a majestic tide of melody. &nbsp;I had
put that up, too, and it was one of the best effects I ever invented.
When it was finished I stood up on the platform and extended my
hands abroad, for two minutes, with my face uplifted&mdash;that always
produces a dead hush&mdash;and then slowly pronounced this ghastly word
with a kind of awfulness which caused hundreds to tremble, and
many women to faint:</p>

<p>"Constantinopolitanischerdudelsackspfeifenmachersgesellschafft!"</p>

<p>Just as I was moaning out the closing hunks of that word, I touched
off one of my electric connections and all that murky world of
people stood revealed in a hideous blue glare! &nbsp;It was
immense&mdash;that effect! &nbsp;Lots of people shrieked, women curled up and quit
in every direction, foundlings collapsed by platoons. &nbsp;The abbot
and the monks crossed themselves nimbly and their lips fluttered
with agitated prayers. &nbsp;Merlin held his grip, but he was astonished
clear down to his corns; he had never seen anything to begin
with that, before. &nbsp;Now was the time to pile in the effects. &nbsp;I lifted
my hands and groaned out this word&mdash;as it were in agony:</p>

<p>"Nihilistendynamittheaterkaestchenssprengungsattentaetsversuchungen!"</p>

<p>&mdash;and turned on the red fire! &nbsp;You should have heard that Atlantic
of people moan and howl when that crimson hell joined the blue!
After sixty seconds I shouted:</p>

<p>"Transvaaltruppentropentransporttrampelthiertreibertrauungsthraenen-
tragoedie!"</p>

<p>&mdash;and lit up the green fire! &nbsp;After waiting only forty seconds this
time, I spread my arms abroad and thundered out the devastating
syllables of this word of words:</p>

<p>"Mekkamuselmannenmassenmenchenmoerdermohrenmuttermarmormonumentenmacher!"</p>

<p>&mdash;and whirled on the purple glare! &nbsp;There they were, all going
at once, red, blue, green, purple!&mdash;four furious volcanoes pouring
vast clouds of radiant smoke aloft, and spreading a blinding
rainbowed noonday to the furthest confines of that valley. &nbsp;In
the distance one could see that fellow on the pillar standing rigid
against the background of sky, his seesaw stopped for the first
time in twenty years. &nbsp;I knew the boys were at the pump now and
ready. &nbsp;So I said to the abbot:</p>

<p>"The time is come, Father. &nbsp;I am about to pronounce the dread name
and command the spell to dissolve. &nbsp;You want to brace up, and take
hold of something." &nbsp;Then I shouted to the people: &nbsp;"Behold, in
another minute the spell will be broken, or no mortal can break it.
If it break, all will know it, for you will see the sacred water
gush from the chapel door!"</p>

<p>I stood a few moments, to let the hearers have a chance to spread
my announcement to those who couldn't hear, and so convey it
to the furthest ranks, then I made a grand exhibition of extra
posturing and gesturing, and shouted:</p>

<p>"Lo, I command the fell spirit that possesses the holy fountain
to now disgorge into the skies all the infernal fires that still
remain in him, and straightway dissolve his spell and flee hence
to the pit, there to lie bound a thousand years. &nbsp;By his own dread
name I command it&mdash;BGWJJILLIGKKK!"</p>

<p>Then I touched off the hogshead of rockets, and a vast fountain of
dazzling lances of fire vomited itself toward the zenith with a
hissing rush, and burst in mid-sky into a storm of flashing jewels!
One mighty groan of terror started up from the massed
people&mdash;then suddenly broke into a wild hosannah of joy&mdash;for there, fair
and plain in the uncanny glare, they saw the freed water leaping
forth! &nbsp;The old abbot could not speak a word, for tears and the
chokings in his throat; without utterance of any sort, he folded me
in his arms and mashed me. &nbsp;It was more eloquent than speech.
And harder to get over, too, in a country where there were really
no doctors that were worth a damaged nickel.</p>

<p>You should have seen those acres of people throw themselves down
in that water and kiss it; kiss it, and pet it, and fondle it, and
talk to it as if it were alive, and welcome it back with the dear
names they gave their darlings, just as if it had been a friend who
was long gone away and lost, and was come home again. &nbsp;Yes, it was
pretty to see, and made me think more of them than I had done before.</p>

<p>I sent Merlin home on a shutter. &nbsp;He had caved in and gone down
like a landslide when I pronounced that fearful name, and had
never come to since. &nbsp;He never had heard that name before,&mdash;neither
had I&mdash;but to him it was the right one. &nbsp;Any jumble would have
been the right one. &nbsp;He admitted, afterward, that that spirit's own
mother could not have pronounced that name better than I did.
He never could understand how I survived it, and I didn't tell
him. &nbsp;It is only young magicians that give away a secret like that.
Merlin spent three months working enchantments to try to find out
the deep trick of how to pronounce that name and outlive it.
But he didn't arrive.</p>

<p>When I started to the chapel, the populace uncovered and fell back
reverently to make a wide way for me, as if I had been some kind
of a superior being&mdash;and I was. &nbsp;I was aware of that. &nbsp;I took along
a night shift of monks, and taught them the mystery of the pump,
and set them to work, for it was plain that a good part of the
people out there were going to sit up with the water all night,
consequently it was but right that they should have all they wanted
of it. &nbsp;To those monks that pump was a good deal of a miracle
itself, and they were full of wonder over it; and of admiration,
too, of the exceeding effectiveness of its performance.</p>

<p>It was a great night, an immense night. &nbsp;There was reputation in it.
I could hardly get to sleep for glorying over it.</p>

<p>A RIVAL MAGICIAN</p>

<p>My influence in the Valley of Holiness was something prodigious
now. &nbsp;It seemed worth while to try to turn it to some valuable
account. &nbsp;The thought came to me the next morning, and was suggested
by my seeing one of my knights who was in the soap line come
riding in. &nbsp;According to history, the monks of this place two
centuries before had been worldly minded enough to want to wash.
It might be that there was a leaven of this unrighteousness still
remaining. &nbsp;So I sounded a Brother:</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like a bath?"</p>

<p>He shuddered at the thought&mdash;the thought of the peril of it to
the well&mdash;but he said with feeling:</p>

<p>"One needs not to ask that of a poor body who has not known that
blessed refreshment sith that he was a boy. &nbsp;Would God I might
wash me! but it may not be, fair sir, tempt me not; it is forbidden."</p>

<p>And then he sighed in such a sorrowful way that I was resolved
he should have at least one layer of his real estate removed,
if it sized up my whole influence and bankrupted the pile. &nbsp;So I
went to the abbot and asked for a permit for this Brother. &nbsp;He
blenched at the idea&mdash;I don't mean that you could see him blench,
for of course you couldn't see it without you scraped him, and
I didn't care enough about it to scrape him, but I knew the blench
was there, just the same, and within a book-cover's thickness of
the surface, too&mdash;blenched, and trembled. &nbsp;He said:</p>

<p>"Ah, son, ask aught else thou wilt, and it is thine, and freely
granted out of a grateful heart&mdash;but this, oh, this! &nbsp;Would you
drive away the blessed water again?"</p>

<p>"No, Father, I will not drive it away. &nbsp;I have mysterious knowledge
which teaches me that there was an error that other time when
it was thought the institution of the bath banished the fountain."
A large interest began to show up in the old man's face. &nbsp;"My
knowledge informs me that the bath was innocent of that misfortune,
which was caused by quite another sort of sin."</p>

<p>"These are brave words&mdash;but&mdash;but right welcome, if they be true."</p>

<p>"They are true, indeed. &nbsp;Let me build the bath again, Father.
Let me build it again, and the fountain shall flow forever."</p>

<p>"You promise this?&mdash;you promise it? &nbsp;Say the word&mdash;say you promise it!"</p>

<p>"I do promise it."</p>

<p>"Then will I have the first bath myself! &nbsp;Go&mdash;get ye to your work.
Tarry not, tarry not, but go."</p>

<p>I and my boys were at work, straight off. &nbsp;The ruins of the old
bath were there yet in the basement of the monastery, not a stone
missing. &nbsp;They had been left just so, all these lifetimes, and
avoided with a pious fear, as things accursed. &nbsp;In two days we
had it all done and the water in&mdash;a spacious pool of clear pure
water that a body could swim in. &nbsp;It was running water, too.
It came in, and went out, through the ancient pipes. &nbsp;The old abbot
kept his word, and was the first to try it. &nbsp;He went down black
and shaky, leaving the whole black community above troubled and
worried and full of bodings; but he came back white and joyful,
and the game was made! another triumph scored.</p>

<p>It was a good campaign that we made in that Valley of Holiness,
and I was very well satisfied, and ready to move on now, but
I struck a disappointment. &nbsp;I caught a heavy cold, and it started
up an old lurking rheumatism of mine. &nbsp;Of course the rheumatism
hunted up my weakest place and located itself there. &nbsp;This was
the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me, what
time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace.</p>

<p>When at last I got out, I was a shadow. &nbsp;But everybody was full
of attentions and kindnesses, and these brought cheer back into
my life, and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly
up toward health and strength again; so I gained fast.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>Sandy was worn out with nursing; so I made up my mind to turn out
and go a cruise alone, leaving her at the nunnery to rest up.
My idea was to disguise myself as a freeman of peasant degree
and wander through the country a week or two on foot. &nbsp;This would
give me a chance to eat and lodge with the lowliest and poorest
class of free citizens on equal terms. &nbsp;There was no other way
to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation
of the laws upon it. &nbsp;If I went among them as a gentleman, there
would be restraints and conventionalities which would shut me out
from their private joys and troubles, and I should get no further
than the outside shell.</p>

<p>One morning I was out on a long walk to get up muscle for my trip,
and had climbed the ridge which bordered the northern extremity
of the valley, when I came upon an artificial opening in the face
of a low precipice, and recognized it by its location as a hermitage
which had often been pointed out to me from a distance as the den
of a hermit of high renown for dirt and austerity. &nbsp;I knew he had
lately been offered a situation in the Great Sahara, where lions
and sandflies made the hermit-life peculiarly attractive and
difficult, and had gone to Africa to take possession, so I thought
I would look in and see how the atmosphere of this den agreed
with its reputation.</p>

<p>My surprise was great: &nbsp;the place was newly swept and scoured.
Then there was another surprise. &nbsp;Back in the gloom of the cavern
I heard the clink of a little bell, and then this exclamation:</p>

<p>"Hello Central! &nbsp;Is this you, Camelot?&mdash;Behold, thou mayst glad
thy heart an thou hast faith to believe the wonderful when that
it cometh in unexpected guise and maketh itself manifest in
impossible places&mdash;here standeth in the flesh his mightiness
The Boss, and with thine own ears shall ye hear him speak!"</p>

<p>Now what a radical reversal of things this was; what a jumbling
together of extravagant incongruities; what a fantastic conjunction
of opposites and irreconcilables&mdash;the home of the bogus miracle
become the home of a real one, the den of a mediaeval hermit turned
into a telephone office!</p>

<p>The telephone clerk stepped into the light, and I recognized one
of my young fellows. &nbsp;I said:</p>

<p>"How long has this office been established here, Ulfius?"</p>

<p>"But since midnight, fair Sir Boss, an it please you. &nbsp;We saw many
lights in the valley, and so judged it well to make a station,
for that where so many lights be needs must they indicate a town
of goodly size."</p>

<p>"Quite right. &nbsp;It isn't a town in the customary sense, but it's
a good stand, anyway. &nbsp;Do you know where you are?"</p>

<p>"Of that I have had no time to make inquiry; for whenas my
comradeship moved hence upon their labors, leaving me in charge,
I got me to needed rest, purposing to inquire when I waked, and
report the place's name to Camelot for record."</p>

<p>"Well, this is the Valley of Holiness."</p>

<p>It didn't take; I mean, he didn't start at the name, as I had
supposed he would. &nbsp;He merely said:</p>

<p>"I will so report it."</p>

<p>"Why, the surrounding regions are filled with the noise of late
wonders that have happened here! &nbsp;You didn't hear of them?"</p>

<p>"Ah, ye will remember we move by night, and avoid speech with all.
We learn naught but that we get by the telephone from Camelot."</p>

<p>"Why <i>they</i>  know all about this thing. &nbsp;Haven't they told you anything
about the great miracle of the restoration of a holy fountain?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i> ? &nbsp;Indeed yes. &nbsp;But the name of <i>this</i>  valley doth woundily
differ from the name of <i>that</i>  one; indeed to differ wider were not pos&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What was that name, then?"</p>

<p>"The Valley of Hellishness."</p>

<p>"<i>That</i>  explains it. &nbsp;Confound a telephone, anyway. &nbsp;It is the very
demon for conveying similarities of sound that are miracles of
divergence from similarity of sense. &nbsp;But no matter, you know
the name of the place now. &nbsp;Call up Camelot."</p>

<p>He did it, and had Clarence sent for. &nbsp;It was good to hear my boy's
voice again. &nbsp;It was like being home. &nbsp;After some affectionate
interchanges, and some account of my late illness, I said:</p>

<p>"What is new?"</p>

<p>"The king and queen and many of the court do start even in this
hour, to go to your valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye
have restored, and cleanse themselves of sin, and see the place
where the infernal spirit spouted true hell-flames to the
clouds&mdash;an ye listen sharply ye may hear me wink and hear me likewise
smile a smile, sith 'twas I that made selection of those flames
from out our stock and sent them by your order."</p>

<p>"Does the king know the way to this place?"</p>

<p>"The king?&mdash;no, nor to any other in his realms, mayhap; but the lads
that holp you with your miracle will be his guide and lead the way,
and appoint the places for rests at noons and sleeps at night."</p>

<p>"This will bring them here&mdash;when?"</p>

<p>"Mid-afternoon, or later, the third day."</p>

<p>"Anything else in the way of news?"</p>

<p>"The king hath begun the raising of the standing army ye suggested
to him; one regiment is complete and officered."</p>

<p>"The mischief! &nbsp;I wanted a main hand in that myself. &nbsp;There is
only one body of men in the kingdom that are fitted to officer
a regular army."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and now ye will marvel to know there's not so much as one
West Pointer in that regiment."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about? &nbsp;Are you in earnest?"</p>

<p>"It is truly as I have said."</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Why, this makes me uneasy. &nbsp;Who were chosen, and what was the
method? &nbsp;Competitive examination?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I know naught of the method. &nbsp;I but know this&mdash;these
officers be all of noble family, and are born&mdash;what is it you
call it?&mdash;chuckleheads."</p>

<p>"There's something wrong, Clarence."</p>

<p>"Comfort yourself, then; for two candidates for a lieutenancy do
travel hence with the king&mdash;young nobles both&mdash;and if you but wait
where you are you will hear them questioned."</p>

<p>"That is news to the purpose. &nbsp;I will get one West Pointer in,
anyway. &nbsp;Mount a man and send him to that school with a message;
let him kill horses, if necessary, but he must be there before
sunset to-night and say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no need. &nbsp;I have laid a ground wire to the school.
Prithee let me connect you with it."</p>

<p>It sounded good! &nbsp;In this atmosphere of telephones and lightning
communication with distant regions, I was breathing the breath
of life again after long suffocation. &nbsp;I realized, then, what a
creepy, dull, inanimate horror this land had been to me all these
years, and how I had been in such a stifled condition of mind as
to have grown used to it almost beyond the power to notice it.</p>

<p>I gave my order to the superintendent of the Academy personally.
I also asked him to bring me some paper and a fountain pen and
a box or so of safety matches. &nbsp;I was getting tired of doing
without these conveniences. &nbsp;I could have them now, as I wasn't
going to wear armor any more at present, and therefore could get
at my pockets.</p>

<p>When I got back to the monastery, I found a thing of interest
going on. &nbsp;The abbot and his monks were assembled in the great
hall, observing with childish wonder and faith the performances
of a new magician, a fresh arrival. &nbsp;His dress was the extreme of
the fantastic; as showy and foolish as the sort of thing an Indian
medicine-man wears. &nbsp;He was mowing, and mumbling, and gesticulating,
and drawing mystical figures in the air and on the floor,&mdash;the
regular thing, you know. &nbsp;He was a celebrity from Asia&mdash;so he
said, and that was enough. &nbsp;That sort of evidence was as good
as gold, and passed current everywhere.</p>

<p>How easy and cheap it was to be a great magician on this fellow's
terms. &nbsp;His specialty was to tell you what any individual on the
face of the globe was doing at the moment; and what he had done
at any time in the past, and what he would do at any time in the
future. &nbsp;He asked if any would like to know what the Emperor of
the East was doing now? &nbsp;The sparkling eyes and the delighted rubbing
of hands made eloquent answer&mdash;this reverend crowd <i>would</i>  like to
know what that monarch was at, just as this moment. &nbsp;The fraud
went through some more mummery, and then made grave announcement:</p>

<p>"The high and mighty Emperor of the East doth at this moment put
money in the palm of a holy begging friar&mdash;one, two, three pieces,
and they be all of silver."</p>

<p>A buzz of admiring exclamations broke out, all around:</p>

<p>"It is marvelous!" &nbsp;"Wonderful!" &nbsp;"What study, what labor, to have
acquired a so amazing power as this!"</p>

<p>Would they like to know what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing?
Yes. &nbsp;He told them what the Supreme Lord of Inde was doing. &nbsp;Then
he told them what the Sultan of Egypt was at; also what the King
of the Remote Seas was about. &nbsp;And so on and so on; and with each
new marvel the astonishment at his accuracy rose higher and higher.
They thought he must surely strike an uncertain place some time;
but no, he never had to hesitate, he always knew, and always with
unerring precision. &nbsp;I saw that if this thing went on I should lose
my supremacy, this fellow would capture my following, I should
be left out in the cold. &nbsp;I must put a cog in his wheel, and do it
right away, too. &nbsp;I said:</p>

<p>"If I might ask, I should very greatly like to know what a certain
person is doing."</p>

<p>"Speak, and freely. &nbsp;I will tell you."</p>

<p>"It will be difficult&mdash;perhaps impossible."</p>

<p>"My art knoweth not that word. &nbsp;The more difficult it is, the more
certainly will I reveal it to you."</p>

<p>You see, I was working up the interest. &nbsp;It was getting pretty
high, too; you could see that by the craning necks all around,
and the half-suspended breathing. &nbsp;So now I climaxed it:</p>

<p>"If you make no mistake&mdash;if you tell me truly what I want to
know&mdash;I will give you two hundred silver pennies."</p>

<p>"The fortune is mine! &nbsp;I will tell you what you would know."</p>

<p>"Then tell me what I am doing with my right hand."</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" &nbsp;There was a general gasp of surprise. &nbsp;It had not occurred
to anybody in the crowd&mdash;that simple trick of inquiring about
somebody who wasn't ten thousand miles away. &nbsp;The magician was
hit hard; it was an emergency that had never happened in his
experience before, and it corked him; he didn't know how to meet
it. &nbsp;He looked stunned, confused; he couldn't say a word. &nbsp;"Come,"
I said, "what are you waiting for? &nbsp;Is it possible you can answer up,
right off, and tell what anybody on the other side of the earth is
doing, and yet can't tell what a person is doing who isn't three
yards from you? &nbsp;Persons behind me know what I am doing with my
right hand&mdash;they will indorse you if you tell correctly." &nbsp;He was
still dumb. &nbsp;"Very well, I'll tell you why you don't speak up and
tell; it is because you don't know. &nbsp;<i>You</i>  a magician! &nbsp;Good friends,
this tramp is a mere fraud and liar."</p>

<p>This distressed the monks and terrified them. &nbsp;They were not used
to hearing these awful beings called names, and they did not know
what might be the consequence. &nbsp;There was a dead silence now;
superstitious bodings were in every mind. &nbsp;The magician began to
pull his wits together, and when he presently smiled an easy,
nonchalant smile, it spread a mighty relief around; for it indicated
that his mood was not destructive. &nbsp;He said:</p>

<p>"It hath struck me speechless, the frivolity of this person's
speech. &nbsp;Let all know, if perchance there be any who know it not,
that enchanters of my degree deign not to concern themselves with
the doings of any but kings, princes, emperors, them that be born
in the purple and them only. &nbsp;Had ye asked me what Arthur the great
king is doing, it were another matter, and I had told ye; but the
doings of a subject interest me not."</p>

<p>"Oh, I misunderstood you. &nbsp;I thought you said 'anybody,' and so
I supposed 'anybody' included&mdash;well, anybody; that is, everybody."</p>

<p>"It doth&mdash;anybody that is of lofty birth; and the better if
he be royal."</p>

<p>"That, it meseemeth, might well be," said the abbot, who saw his
opportunity to smooth things and avert disaster, "for it were not
likely that so wonderful a gift as this would be conferred for
the revelation of the concerns of lesser beings than such as be
born near to the summits of greatness. &nbsp;Our Arthur the king&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Would you know of him?" broke in the enchanter.</p>

<p>"Most gladly, yea, and gratefully."</p>

<p>Everybody was full of awe and interest again right away, the
incorrigible idiots. &nbsp;They watched the incantations absorbingly,
and looked at me with a "There, now, what can you say to that?"
air, when the announcement came:</p>

<p>"The king is weary with the chase, and lieth in his palace these
two hours sleeping a dreamless sleep."</p>

<p>"God's benison upon him!" said the abbot, and crossed himself;
"may that sleep be to the refreshment of his body and his soul."</p>

<p>"And so it might be, if he were sleeping," I said, "but the king
is not sleeping, the king rides."</p>

<p>Here was trouble again&mdash;a conflict of authority. &nbsp;Nobody knew which
of us to believe; I still had some reputation left. &nbsp;The magician's
scorn was stirred, and he said:</p>

<p>"Lo, I have seen many wonderful soothsayers and prophets and
magicians in my life days, but none before that could sit idle and
see to the heart of things with never an incantation to help."</p>

<p>"You have lived in the woods, and lost much by it. &nbsp;I use incantations
myself, as this good brotherhood are aware&mdash;but only on occasions
of moment."</p>

<p>When it comes to sarcasming, I reckon I know how to keep my end up.
That jab made this fellow squirm. &nbsp;The abbot inquired after the
queen and the court, and got this information:</p>

<p>"They be all on sleep, being overcome by fatigue, like as to the king."</p>

<p>I said:</p>

<p>"That is merely another lie. &nbsp;Half of them are about their amusements,
the queen and the other half are not sleeping, they ride. &nbsp;Now
perhaps you can spread yourself a little, and tell us where the king
and queen and all that are this moment riding with them are going?"</p>

<p>"They sleep now, as I said; but on the morrow they will ride,
for they go a journey toward the sea."</p>

<p>"And where will they be the day after to-morrow at vespers?"</p>

<p>"Far to the north of Camelot, and half their journey will be done."</p>

<p>"That is another lie, by the space of a hundred and fifty miles.
Their journey will not be merely half done, it will be all done,
and they will be <i>here</i> , in this valley."</p>

<p><i>That</i>  was a noble shot! &nbsp;It set the abbot and the monks in a whirl
of excitement, and it rocked the enchanter to his base. &nbsp;I followed
the thing right up:</p>

<p>"If the king does not arrive, I will have myself ridden on a rail:
if he does I will ride you on a rail instead."</p>

<p>Next day I went up to the telephone office and found that the king
had passed through two towns that were on the line. &nbsp;I spotted
his progress on the succeeding day in the same way. &nbsp;I kept these
matters to myself. &nbsp;The third day's reports showed that if he
kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon. &nbsp;There
was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming; there seemed
to be no preparations making to receive him in state; a strange
thing, truly. &nbsp;Only one thing could explain this: &nbsp;that other
magician had been cutting under me, sure. &nbsp;This was true. &nbsp;I asked
a friend of mine, a monk, about it, and he said, yes, the magician
had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court
had concluded to make no journey at all, but stay at home. &nbsp;Think
of that! &nbsp;Observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country.
These people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in
history, and the only one within their memory that had a positive
value, and yet here they were, ready to take up with an adventurer
who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere unproven word.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>However, it was not good politics to let the king come without
any fuss and feathers at all, so I went down and drummed up a
procession of pilgrims and smoked out a batch of hermits and
started them out at two o'clock to meet him. &nbsp;And that was the
sort of state he arrived in. &nbsp;The abbot was helpless with rage
and humiliation when I brought him out on a balcony and showed
him the head of the state marching in and never a monk on hand to
offer him welcome, and no stir of life or clang of joy-bell to glad
his spirit. &nbsp;He took one look and then flew to rouse out his forces.
The next minute the bells were dinning furiously, and the various
buildings were vomiting monks and nuns, who went swarming in a
rush toward the coming procession; and with them went that
magician&mdash;and he was on a rail, too, by the abbot's order; and his reputation
was in the mud, and mine was in the sky again. &nbsp;Yes, a man can
keep his trademark current in such a country, but he can't sit
around and do it; he has got to be on deck and attending to business
right along.</p>

<p>When the king traveled for change of air, or made a progress, or
visited a distant noble whom he wished to bankrupt with the cost
of his keep, part of the administration moved with him. &nbsp;It was
a fashion of the time. &nbsp;The Commission charged with the examination
of candidates for posts in the army came with the king to the
Valley, whereas they could have transacted their business just
as well at home. &nbsp;And although this expedition was strictly a
holiday excursion for the king, he kept some of his business
functions going just the same. &nbsp;He touched for the evil, as usual;
he held court in the gate at sunrise and tried cases, for he was
himself Chief Justice of the King's Bench.</p>

<p>He shone very well in this latter office. &nbsp;He was a wise and humane
judge, and he clearly did his honest best and fairest,&mdash;according
to his lights. &nbsp;That is a large reservation. &nbsp;His lights&mdash;I mean
his rearing&mdash;often colored his decisions. &nbsp;Whenever there was a
dispute between a noble or gentleman and a person of lower degree,
the king's leanings and sympathies were for the former class always,
whether he suspected it or not. &nbsp;It was impossible that this should
be otherwise. &nbsp;The blunting effects of slavery upon the slaveholder's
moral perceptions are known and conceded, the world over; and a
privileged class, an aristocracy, is but a band of slaveholders
under another name. &nbsp;This has a harsh sound, and yet should not
be offensive to any&mdash;even to the noble himself&mdash;unless the fact
itself be an offense: &nbsp;for the statement simply formulates a fact.
The repulsive feature of slavery is the <i>thing</i> , not its name. &nbsp;One
needs but to hear an aristocrat speak of the classes that are below
him to recognize&mdash;and in but indifferently modified
measure&mdash;the very air and tone of the actual slaveholder; and behind these
are the slaveholder's spirit, the slaveholder's blunted feeling.
They are the result of the same cause in both cases: &nbsp;the possessor's
old and inbred custom of regarding himself as a superior being.
The king's judgments wrought frequent injustices, but it was merely
the fault of his training, his natural and unalterable sympathies.
He was as unfitted for a judgeship as would be the average mother
for the position of milk-distributor to starving children in
famine-time; her own children would fare a shade better than the rest.</p>

<p>One very curious case came before the king. &nbsp;A young girl, an
orphan, who had a considerable estate, married a fine young fellow
who had nothing. &nbsp;The girl's property was within a seigniory held
by the Church. &nbsp;The bishop of the diocese, an arrogant scion of
the great nobility, claimed the girl's estate on the ground that
she had married privately, and thus had cheated the Church out
of one of its rights as lord of the seigniory&mdash;the one heretofore
referred to as le droit du seigneur. &nbsp;The penalty of refusal or
avoidance was confiscation. &nbsp;The girl's defense was, that the
lordship of the seigniory was vested in the bishop, and the
particular right here involved was not transferable, but must be
exercised by the lord himself or stand vacated; and that an older
law, of the Church itself, strictly barred the bishop from exercising
it. &nbsp;It was a very odd case, indeed.</p>

<p>It reminded me of something I had read in my youth about the
ingenious way in which the aldermen of London raised the money
that built the Mansion House. &nbsp;A person who had not taken the
Sacrament according to the Anglican rite could not stand as a
candidate for sheriff of London. &nbsp;Thus Dissenters were ineligible;
they could not run if asked, they could not serve if elected.
The aldermen, who without any question were Yankees in disguise,
hit upon this neat device: &nbsp;they passed a by-law imposing a fine
of L400 upon any one who should refuse to be a candidate for
sheriff, and a fine of L600 upon any person who, after being
elected sheriff, refused to serve. &nbsp;Then they went to work and
elected a lot of Dissenters, one after another, and kept it up
until they had collected L15,000 in fines; and there stands the
stately Mansion House to this day, to keep the blushing citizen
in mind of a long past and lamented day when a band of Yankees
slipped into London and played games of the sort that has given
their race a unique and shady reputation among all truly good
and holy peoples that be in the earth.</p>

<p>The girl's case seemed strong to me; the bishop's case was just
as strong. &nbsp;I did not see how the king was going to get out of
this hole. &nbsp;But he got out. &nbsp;I append his decision:</p>

<p>"Truly I find small difficulty here, the matter being even a
child's affair for simpleness. &nbsp;An the young bride had conveyed
notice, as in duty bound, to her feudal lord and proper master
and protector the bishop, she had suffered no loss, for the said
bishop could have got a dispensation making him, for temporary
conveniency, eligible to the exercise of his said right, and thus
would she have kept all she had. &nbsp;Whereas, failing in her first
duty, she hath by that failure failed in all; for whoso, clinging
to a rope, severeth it above his hands, must fall; it being no
defense to claim that the rest of the rope is sound, neither any
deliverance from his peril, as he shall find. &nbsp;Pardy, the woman's
case is rotten at the source. &nbsp;It is the decree of the court that
she forfeit to the said lord bishop all her goods, even to the
last farthing that she doth possess, and be thereto mulcted in
the costs. &nbsp;Next!"</p>

<p>Here was a tragic end to a beautiful honeymoon not yet three months
old. &nbsp;Poor young creatures! &nbsp;They had lived these three months
lapped to the lips in worldly comforts. &nbsp;These clothes and trinkets
they were wearing were as fine and dainty as the shrewdest stretch
of the sumptuary laws allowed to people of their degree; and in
these pretty clothes, she crying on his shoulder, and he trying
to comfort her with hopeful words set to the music of despair,
they went from the judgment seat out into the world homeless,
bedless, breadless; why, the very beggars by the roadsides were
not so poor as they.</p>

<p>Well, the king was out of the hole; and on terms satisfactory to
the Church and the rest of the aristocracy, no doubt. &nbsp;Men write
many fine and plausible arguments in support of monarchy, but
the fact remains that where every man in a State has a vote, brutal
laws are impossible. &nbsp;Arthur's people were of course poor material
for a republic, because they had been debased so long by monarchy;
and yet even they would have been intelligent enough to make short
work of that law which the king had just been administering if it
had been submitted to their full and free vote. &nbsp;There is a phrase
which has grown so common in the world's mouth that it has come
to seem to have sense and meaning&mdash;the sense and meaning implied
when it is used; that is the phrase which refers to this or that or
the other nation as possibly being "capable of self-government";
and the implied sense of it is, that there has been a nation
somewhere, some time or other which <i>wasn't</i>  capable of it&mdash;wasn't as
able to govern itself as some self-appointed specialists were or
would be to govern it. &nbsp;The master minds of all nations, in all
ages, have sprung in affluent multitude from the mass of the nation,
and from the mass of the nation only&mdash;not from its privileged
classes; and so, no matter what the nation's intellectual grade
was; whether high or low, the bulk of its ability was in the long
ranks of its nameless and its poor, and so it never saw the day
that it had not the material in abundance whereby to govern itself.
Which is to assert an always self-proven fact: &nbsp;that even the best
governed and most free and most enlightened monarchy is still
behind the best condition attainable by its people; and that the
same is true of kindred governments of lower grades, all the way
down to the lowest.</p>

<p>King Arthur had hurried up the army business altogether beyond
my calculations. &nbsp;I had not supposed he would move in the matter
while I was away; and so I had not mapped out a scheme for determining
the merits of officers; I had only remarked that it would be wise
to submit every candidate to a sharp and searching examination;
and privately I meant to put together a list of military qualifications
that nobody could answer to but my West Pointers. &nbsp;That ought
to have been attended to before I left; for the king was so taken
with the idea of a standing army that he couldn't wait but must
get about it at once, and get up as good a scheme of examination
as he could invent out of his own head.</p>

<p>I was impatient to see what this was; and to show, too, how much
more admirable was the one which I should display to the Examining
Board. &nbsp;I intimated this, gently, to the king, and it fired his
curiosity. &nbsp;When the Board was assembled, I followed him in; and
behind us came the candidates. &nbsp;One of these candidates was a bright
young West Pointer of mine, and with him were a couple of my
West Point professors.</p>

<p>When I saw the Board, I did not know whether to cry or to laugh.
The head of it was the officer known to later centuries as Norroy
King-at-Arms! &nbsp;The two other members were chiefs of bureaus in
his department; and all three were priests, of course; all officials
who had to know how to read and write were priests.</p>

<p>My candidate was called first, out of courtesy to me, and the head
of the Board opened on him with official solemnity:</p>

<p>"Name?"</p>

<p>"Mal-ease."</p>

<p>"Son of?"</p>

<p>"Webster."</p>

<p>"Webster&mdash;Webster. &nbsp;H'm&mdash;I&mdash;my memory faileth to recall the
name. &nbsp;Condition?"</p>

<p>"Weaver."</p>

<p>"Weaver!&mdash;God keep us!"</p>

<p>The king was staggered, from his summit to his foundations; one
clerk fainted, and the others came near it. &nbsp;The chairman pulled
himself together, and said indignantly:</p>

<p>"It is sufficient. &nbsp;Get you hence."</p>

<p>But I appealed to the king. &nbsp;I begged that my candidate might be
examined. &nbsp;The king was willing, but the Board, who were all
well-born folk, implored the king to spare them the indignity of
examining the weaver's son. &nbsp;I knew they didn't know enough to
examine him anyway, so I joined my prayers to theirs and the king
turned the duty over to my professors. &nbsp;I had had a blackboard
prepared, and it was put up now, and the circus began. &nbsp;It was
beautiful to hear the lad lay out the science of war, and wallow
in details of battle and siege, of supply, transportation, mining
and countermining, grand tactics, big strategy and little strategy,
signal service, infantry, cavalry, artillery, and all about siege
guns, field guns, gatling guns, rifled guns, smooth bores, musket
practice, revolver practice&mdash;and not a solitary word of it all
could these catfish make head or tail of, you understand&mdash;and it
was handsome to see him chalk off mathematical nightmares on the
blackboard that would stump the angels themselves, and do it like
nothing, too&mdash;all about eclipses, and comets, and solstices, and
constellations, and mean time, and sidereal time, and dinner time,
and bedtime, and every other imaginable thing above the clouds or
under them that you could harry or bullyrag an enemy with and make
him wish he hadn't come&mdash;and when the boy made his military salute
and stood aside at last, I was proud enough to hug him, and all
those other people were so dazed they looked partly petrified,
partly drunk, and wholly caught out and snowed under. &nbsp;I judged
that the cake was ours, and by a large majority.</p>

<p>Education is a great thing. &nbsp;This was the same youth who had come
to West Point so ignorant that when I asked him, "If a general
officer should have a horse shot under him on the field of battle,
what ought he to do?" answered up naively and said:</p>

<p>"Get up and brush himself."</p>

<p>One of the young nobles was called up now. &nbsp;I thought I would
question him a little myself. &nbsp;I said:</p>

<p>"Can your lordship read?"</p>

<p>His face flushed indignantly, and he fired this at me:</p>

<p>"Takest me for a clerk? &nbsp;I trow I am not of a blood that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Answer the question!"</p>

<p>He crowded his wrath down and made out to answer "No."</p>

<p>"Can you write?"</p>

<p>He wanted to resent this, too, but I said:</p>

<p>"You will confine yourself to the questions, and make no comments.
You are not here to air your blood or your graces, and nothing
of the sort will be permitted. &nbsp;Can you write?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you know the multiplication table?"</p>

<p>"I wit not what ye refer to."</p>

<p>"How much is 9 times 6?"</p>

<p>"It is a mystery that is hidden from me by reason that the emergency
requiring the fathoming of it hath not in my life-days occurred,
and so, not having no need to know this thing, I abide barren
of the knowledge."</p>

<p>"If A trade a barrel of onions to B, worth 2 pence the bushel,
in exchange for a sheep worth 4 pence and a dog worth a penny,
and C kill the dog before delivery, because bitten by the same,
who mistook him for D, what sum is still due to A from B, and
which party pays for the dog, C or D, and who gets the money?
If A, is the penny sufficient, or may he claim consequential damages
in the form of additional money to represent the possible profit
which might have inured from the dog, and classifiable as earned
increment, that is to say, usufruct?"</p>

<p>"Verily, in the all-wise and unknowable providence of God, who
moveth in mysterious ways his wonders to perform, have I never
heard the fellow to this question for confusion of the mind and
congestion of the ducts of thought. &nbsp;Wherefore I beseech you let
the dog and the onions and these people of the strange and godless
names work out their several salvations from their piteous and
wonderful difficulties without help of mine, for indeed their
trouble is sufficient as it is, whereas an I tried to help I should
but damage their cause the more and yet mayhap not live myself
to see the desolation wrought."</p>

<p>"What do you know of the laws of attraction and gravitation?"</p>

<p>"If there be such, mayhap his grace the king did promulgate them
whilst that I lay sick about the beginning of the year and thereby
failed to hear his proclamation."</p>

<p>"What do you know of the science of optics?"</p>

<p>"I know of governors of places, and seneschals of castles, and
sheriffs of counties, and many like small offices and titles of
honor, but him you call the Science of Optics I have not heard
of before; peradventure it is a new dignity."</p>

<p>"Yes, in this country."</p>

<p>Try to conceive of this mollusk gravely applying for an official
position, of any kind under the sun! &nbsp;Why, he had all the earmarks
of a typewriter copyist, if you leave out the disposition to
contribute uninvited emendations of your grammar and punctuation.
It was unaccountable that he didn't attempt a little help of that
sort out of his majestic supply of incapacity for the job. &nbsp;But that
didn't prove that he hadn't material in him for the disposition,
it only proved that he wasn't a typewriter copyist yet. &nbsp;After
nagging him a little more, I let the professors loose on him and
they turned him inside out, on the line of scientific war, and
found him empty, of course. &nbsp;He knew somewhat about the warfare
of the time&mdash;bushwhacking around for ogres, and bull-fights in
the tournament ring, and such things&mdash;but otherwise he was empty
and useless. &nbsp;Then we took the other young noble in hand, and he
was the first one's twin, for ignorance and incapacity. &nbsp;I delivered
them into the hands of the chairman of the Board with the comfortable
consciousness that their cake was dough. &nbsp;They were examined in
the previous order of precedence.</p>

<p>"Name, so please you?"</p>

<p>"Pertipole, son of Sir Pertipole, Baron of Barley Mash."</p>

<p>"Grandfather?"</p>

<p>"Also Sir Pertipole, Baron of Barley Mash."</p>

<p>"Great-grandfather?"</p>

<p>"The same name and title."</p>

<p>"Great-great-grandfather?"</p>

<p>"We had none, worshipful sir, the line failing before it had
reached so far back."</p>

<p>"It mattereth not. &nbsp;It is a good four generations, and fulfilleth
the requirements of the rule."</p>

<p>"Fulfills what rule?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The rule requiring four generations of nobility or else the
candidate is not eligible."</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>"A man not eligible for a lieutenancy in the army unless he can
prove four generations of noble descent?"</p>

<p>"Even so; neither lieutenant nor any other officer may be commissioned
without that qualification."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, this is an astonishing thing. &nbsp;What good is such a
qualification as that?"</p>

<p>"What good? &nbsp;It is a hardy question, fair sir and Boss, since it doth
go far to impugn the wisdom of even our holy Mother Church herself."</p>

<p>"As how?"</p>

<p>"For that she hath established the self-same rule regarding
saints. &nbsp;By her law none may be canonized until he hath lain dead
four generations."</p>

<p>"I see, I see&mdash;it is the same thing. &nbsp;It is wonderful. &nbsp;In the one
case a man lies dead-alive four generations&mdash;mummified in ignorance
and sloth&mdash;and that qualifies him to command live people, and take
their weal and woe into his impotent hands; and in the other case,
a man lies bedded with death and worms four generations, and that
qualifies him for office in the celestial camp. &nbsp;Does the king's
grace approve of this strange law?"</p>

<p>The king said:</p>

<p>"Why, truly I see naught about it that is strange. &nbsp;All places of
honor and of profit do belong, by natural right, to them that be
of noble blood, and so these dignities in the army are their
property and would be so without this or any rule. &nbsp;The rule is
but to mark a limit. &nbsp;Its purpose is to keep out too recent blood,
which would bring into contempt these offices, and men of lofty
lineage would turn their backs and scorn to take them. &nbsp;I were
to blame an I permitted this calamity. &nbsp;<i>You</i>  can permit it an you
are minded so to do, for you have the delegated authority, but
that the king should do it were a most strange madness and not
comprehensible to any."</p>

<p>"I yield. &nbsp;Proceed, sir Chief of the Herald's College."</p>

<p>The chairman resumed as follows:</p>

<p>"By what illustrious achievement for the honor of the Throne and
State did the founder of your great line lift himself to the
sacred dignity of the British nobility?"</p>

<p>"He built a brewery."</p>

<p>"Sire, the Board finds this candidate perfect in all the requirements
and qualifications for military command, and doth hold his case
open for decision after due examination of his competitor."</p>

<p>The competitor came forward and proved exactly four generations
of nobility himself. &nbsp;So there was a tie in military qualifications
that far.</p>

<p>He stood aside a moment, and Sir Pertipole was questioned further:</p>

<p>"Of what condition was the wife of the founder of your line?"</p>

<p>"She came of the highest landed gentry, yet she was not noble;
she was gracious and pure and charitable, of a blameless life and
character, insomuch that in these regards was she peer of the
best lady in the land."</p>

<p>"That will do. &nbsp;Stand down." &nbsp;He called up the competing lordling
again, and asked: &nbsp;"What was the rank and condition of the
great-grandmother who conferred British nobility upon your
great house?"</p>

<p>"She was a king's leman and did climb to that splendid eminence
by her own unholpen merit from the sewer where she was born."</p>

<p>"Ah, this, indeed, is true nobility, this is the right and perfect
intermixture. &nbsp;The lieutenancy is yours, fair lord. &nbsp;Hold it not in
contempt; it is the humble step which will lead to grandeurs more
worthy of the splendor of an origin like to thine."</p>

<p>I was down in the bottomless pit of humiliation. &nbsp;I had promised
myself an easy and zenith-scouring triumph, and this was the outcome!</p>

<p>I was almost ashamed to look my poor disappointed cadet in the
face. &nbsp;I told him to go home and be patient, this wasn't the end.</p>

<p>I had a private audience with the king, and made a proposition.
I said it was quite right to officer that regiment with nobilities,
and he couldn't have done a wiser thing. &nbsp;It would also be a good
idea to add five hundred officers to it; in fact, add as many
officers as there were nobles and relatives of nobles in the
country, even if there should finally be five times as many officers
as privates in it; and thus make it the crack regiment, the envied
regiment, the King's Own regiment, and entitled to fight on its
own hook and in its own way, and go whither it would and come
when it pleased, in time of war, and be utterly swell and independent.
This would make that regiment the heart's desire of all the
nobility, and they would all be satisfied and happy. &nbsp;Then we
would make up the rest of the standing army out of commonplace
materials, and officer it with nobodies, as was proper&mdash;nobodies
selected on a basis of mere efficiency&mdash;and we would make this
regiment toe the line, allow it no aristocratic freedom from
restraint, and force it to do all the work and persistent hammering,
to the end that whenever the King's Own was tired and wanted to go
off for a change and rummage around amongst ogres and have a good
time, it could go without uneasiness, knowing that matters were in
safe hands behind it, and business going to be continued at the
old stand, same as usual. &nbsp;The king was charmed with the idea.</p>

<p>When I noticed that, it gave me a valuable notion. &nbsp;I thought
I saw my way out of an old and stubborn difficulty at last. &nbsp;You
see, the royalties of the Pendragon stock were a long-lived race
and very fruitful. &nbsp;Whenever a child was born to any of
these&mdash;and it was pretty often&mdash;there was wild joy in the nation's mouth,
and piteous sorrow in the nation's heart. &nbsp;The joy was questionable,
but the grief was honest. &nbsp;Because the event meant another call
for a Royal Grant. &nbsp;Long was the list of these royalties, and
they were a heavy and steadily increasing burden upon the treasury
and a menace to the crown. &nbsp;Yet Arthur could not believe this
latter fact, and he would not listen to any of my various projects
for substituting something in the place of the royal grants. &nbsp;If I
could have persuaded him to now and then provide a support for
one of these outlying scions from his own pocket, I could have
made a grand to-do over it, and it would have had a good effect
with the nation; but no, he wouldn't hear of such a thing. &nbsp;He had
something like a religious passion for royal grant; he seemed to
look upon it as a sort of sacred swag, and one could not irritate
him in any way so quickly and so surely as by an attack upon that
venerable institution. &nbsp;If I ventured to cautiously hint that there
was not another respectable family in England that would humble
itself to hold out the hat&mdash;however, that is as far as I ever got;
he always cut me short there, and peremptorily, too.</p>

<p>But I believed I saw my chance at last. &nbsp;I would form this crack
regiment out of officers alone&mdash;not a single private. &nbsp;Half of it
should consist of nobles, who should fill all the places up to
Major-General, and serve gratis and pay their own expenses; and
they would be glad to do this when they should learn that the rest
of the regiment would consist exclusively of princes of the blood.
These princes of the blood should range in rank from Lieutenant-General
up to Field Marshal, and be gorgeously salaried and equipped and
fed by the state. &nbsp;Moreover&mdash;and this was the master
stroke&mdash;it should be decreed that these princely grandees should be always
addressed by a stunningly gaudy and awe-compelling title (which
I would presently invent), and they and they only in all England
should be so addressed. &nbsp;Finally, all princes of the blood should
have free choice; join that regiment, get that great title, and
renounce the royal grant, or stay out and receive a grant. &nbsp;Neatest
touch of all: &nbsp;unborn but imminent princes of the blood could be
<i>born</i>  into the regiment, and start fair, with good wages and a
permanent situation, upon due notice from the parents.</p>

<p>All the boys would join, I was sure of that; so, all existing
grants would be relinquished; that the newly born would always
join was equally certain. &nbsp;Within sixty days that quaint and
bizarre anomaly, the Royal Grant, would cease to be a living fact,
and take its place among the curiosities of the past.</p>

<p>THE FIRST NEWSPAPER</p>

<p>When I told the king I was going out disguised as a petty freeman
to scour the country and familiarize myself with the humbler life
of the people, he was all afire with the novelty of the thing
in a minute, and was bound to take a chance in the adventure
himself&mdash;nothing should stop him&mdash;he would drop everything and
go along&mdash;it was the prettiest idea he had run across for many
a day. &nbsp;He wanted to glide out the back way and start at once;
but I showed him that that wouldn't answer. &nbsp;You see, he was billed
for the king's-evil&mdash;to touch for it, I mean&mdash;and it wouldn't be
right to disappoint the house and it wouldn't make a delay worth
considering, anyway, it was only a one-night stand. &nbsp;And I thought
he ought to tell the queen he was going away. &nbsp;He clouded up at
that and looked sad. &nbsp;I was sorry I had spoken, especially when
he said mournfully:</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Thou forgettest that Launcelot is here; and where Launcelot is,
she noteth not the going forth of the king, nor what day he returneth."</p>

<p>Of course, I changed the Subject. &nbsp;Yes, Guenever was beautiful,
it is true, but take her all around she was pretty slack. &nbsp;I never
meddled in these matters, they weren't my affair, but I did hate
to see the way things were going on, and I don't mind saying that
much. &nbsp;Many's the time she had asked me, "Sir Boss, hast seen
Sir Launcelot about?" but if ever she went fretting around for
the king I didn't happen to be around at the time.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>There was a very good lay-out for the king's-evil business&mdash;very
tidy and creditable. &nbsp;The king sat under a canopy of state; about
him were clustered a large body of the clergy in full canonicals.
Conspicuous, both for location and personal outfit, stood Marinel,
a hermit of the quack-doctor species, to introduce the sick. &nbsp;All
abroad over the spacious floor, and clear down to the doors,
in a thick jumble, lay or sat the scrofulous, under a strong light.
It was as good as a tableau; in fact, it had all the look of being
gotten up for that, though it wasn't. &nbsp;There were eight hundred
sick people present. &nbsp;The work was slow; it lacked the interest
of novelty for me, because I had seen the ceremonies before;
the thing soon became tedious, but the proprieties required me
to stick it out. &nbsp;The doctor was there for the reason that in all
such crowds there were many people who only imagined something
was the matter with them, and many who were consciously sound
but wanted the immortal honor of fleshly contact with a king, and
yet others who pretended to illness in order to get the piece of
coin that went with the touch. &nbsp;Up to this time this coin had been
a wee little gold piece worth about a third of a dollar. &nbsp;When you
consider how much that amount of money would buy, in that age
and country, and how usual it was to be scrofulous, when not dead,
you would understand that the annual king's-evil appropriation was
just the River and Harbor bill of that government for the grip it
took on the treasury and the chance it afforded for skinning the
surplus. &nbsp;So I had privately concluded to touch the treasury itself
for the king's-evil. &nbsp;I covered six-sevenths of the appropriation
into the treasury a week before starting from Camelot on my
adventures, and ordered that the other seventh be inflated into
five-cent nickels and delivered into the hands of the head clerk
of the King's Evil Department; a nickel to take the place of each
gold coin, you see, and do its work for it. &nbsp;It might strain the
nickel some, but I judged it could stand it. &nbsp;As a rule, I do not
approve of watering stock, but I considered it square enough
in this case, for it was just a gift, anyway. &nbsp;Of course, you can
water a gift as much as you want to; and I generally do. &nbsp;The old
gold and silver coins of the country were of ancient and unknown
origin, as a rule, but some of them were Roman; they were ill-shapen,
and seldom rounder than a moon that is a week past the full; they
were hammered, not minted, and they were so worn with use that
the devices upon them were as illegible as blisters, and looked
like them. &nbsp;I judged that a sharp, bright new nickel, with a
first-rate likeness of the king on one side of it and Guenever
on the other, and a blooming pious motto, would take the tuck out
of scrofula as handy as a nobler coin and please the scrofulous
fancy more; and I was right. &nbsp;This batch was the first it was
tried on, and it worked to a charm. &nbsp;The saving in expense was
a notable economy. &nbsp;You will see that by these figures: &nbsp;We touched
a trifle over 700 of the 800 patients; at former rates, this would
have cost the government about $240; at the new rate we pulled
through for about $35, thus saving upward of $200 at one swoop.
To appreciate the full magnitude of this stroke, consider these
other figures: &nbsp;the annual expenses of a national government amount
to the equivalent of a contribution of three days' average wages of
every individual of the population, counting every individual as
if he were a man. &nbsp;If you take a nation of 60,000,000, where average
wages are $2 per day, three days' wages taken from each individual
will provide $360,000,000 and pay the government's expenses. &nbsp;In my
day, in my own country, this money was collected from imposts,
and the citizen imagined that the foreign importer paid it, and it
made him comfortable to think so; whereas, in fact, it was paid
by the American people, and was so equally and exactly distributed
among them that the annual cost to the 100-millionaire and the
annual cost to the sucking child of the day-laborer was precisely
the same&mdash;each paid $6. &nbsp;Nothing could be equaler than that,
I reckon. &nbsp;Well, Scotland and Ireland were tributary to Arthur,
and the united populations of the British Islands amounted to
something less than 1,000,000. &nbsp;A mechanic's average wage was
3 cents a day, when he paid his own keep. &nbsp;By this rule the national
government's expenses were $90,000 a year, or about $250 a day.
Thus, by the substitution of nickels for gold on a king's-evil
day, I not only injured no one, dissatisfied no one, but pleased
all concerned and saved four-fifths of that day's national expense
into the bargain&mdash;a saving which would have been the equivalent
of $800,000 in my day in America. &nbsp;In making this substitution
I had drawn upon the wisdom of a very remote source&mdash;the wisdom
of my boyhood&mdash;for the true statesman does not despise any wisdom,
howsoever lowly may be its origin: &nbsp;in my boyhood I had always
saved my pennies and contributed buttons to the foreign missionary
cause. &nbsp;The buttons would answer the ignorant savage as well as
the coin, the coin would answer me better than the buttons; all
hands were happy and nobody hurt.</p>

<p>Marinel took the patients as they came. &nbsp;He examined the candidate;
if he couldn't qualify he was warned off; if he could he was passed
along to the king. &nbsp;A priest pronounced the words, "They shall
lay their hands on the sick, and they shall recover." &nbsp;Then the king
stroked the ulcers, while the reading continued; finally, the
patient graduated and got his nickel&mdash;the king hanging it around
his neck himself&mdash;and was dismissed. &nbsp;Would you think that that
would cure? &nbsp;It certainly did. &nbsp;Any mummery will cure if the
patient's faith is strong in it. &nbsp;Up by Astolat there was a chapel
where the Virgin had once appeared to a girl who used to herd
geese around there&mdash;the girl said so herself&mdash;and they built the
chapel upon that spot and hung a picture in it representing the
occurrence&mdash;a picture which you would think it dangerous for a sick
person to approach; whereas, on the contrary, thousands of the lame
and the sick came and prayed before it every year and went away
whole and sound; and even the well could look upon it and live.
Of course, when I was told these things I did not believe them;
but when I went there and saw them I had to succumb. &nbsp;I saw the
cures effected myself; and they were real cures and not questionable.
I saw cripples whom I had seen around Camelot for years on crutches,
arrive and pray before that picture, and put down their crutches
and walk off without a limp. &nbsp;There were piles of crutches there
which had been left by such people as a testimony.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<img alt="26-338.jpg (147K)" src="images/26-338.jpg" height="876" width="717">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>In other places people operated on a patient's mind, without saying
a word to him, and cured him. &nbsp;In others, experts assembled patients
in a room and prayed over them, and appealed to their faith, and
those patients went away cured. &nbsp;Wherever you find a king who can't
cure the king's-evil you can be sure that the most valuable
superstition that supports his throne&mdash;the subject's belief in
the divine appointment of his sovereign&mdash;has passed away. &nbsp;In my
youth the monarchs of England had ceased to touch for the evil,
but there was no occasion for this diffidence: &nbsp;they could have
cured it forty-nine times in fifty.</p>

<p>Well, when the priest had been droning for three hours, and the
good king polishing the evidences, and the sick were still pressing
forward as plenty as ever, I got to feeling intolerably bored.
I was sitting by an open window not far from the canopy of state.
For the five hundredth time a patient stood forward to have his
repulsivenesses stroked; again those words were being droned out:
"they shall lay their hands on the sick"&mdash;when outside there rang
clear as a clarion a note that enchanted my soul and tumbled
thirteen worthless centuries about my ears: &nbsp;"Camelot <i>Weekly
Hosannah and Literary Volcano!</i>&mdash;latest irruption&mdash;only two
cents&mdash;all about the big miracle in the Valley of Holiness!" &nbsp;One greater
than kings had arrived&mdash;the newsboy. &nbsp;But I was the only person
in all that throng who knew the meaning of this mighty birth, and
what this imperial magician was come into the world to do.</p>

<p>I dropped a nickel out of the window and got my paper; the
Adam-newsboy of the world went around the corner to get my change;
is around the corner yet. &nbsp;It was delicious to see a newspaper
again, yet I was conscious of a secret shock when my eye fell upon
the first batch of display head-lines. &nbsp;I had lived in a clammy
atmosphere of reverence, respect, deference, so long that they
sent a quivery little cold wave through me:</p>

&mdash;and so on, and so on. &nbsp;Yes, it was too loud. &nbsp;Once I could have
enjoyed it and seen nothing out of the way about it, but now its
note was discordant. &nbsp;It was good Arkansas journalism, but this
was not Arkansas. &nbsp;Moreover, the next to the last line was calculated
to give offense to the hermits, and perhaps lose us their advertising.
Indeed, there was too lightsome a tone of flippancy all through
the paper. &nbsp;It was plain I had undergone a considerable change
without noticing it. &nbsp;I found myself unpleasantly affected by
pert little irreverencies which would have seemed but proper and
airy graces of speech at an earlier period of my life. &nbsp;There was an
abundance of the following breed of items, and they discomforted me:</p>

<p>Of course it was good enough journalism for a beginning; I knew
that quite well, and yet it was somehow disappointing. &nbsp;The
"Court Circular" pleased me better; indeed, its simple and dignified
respectfulness was a distinct refreshment to me after all those
disgraceful familiarities. &nbsp;But even it could have been improved.
Do what one may, there is no getting an air of variety into a court
circular, I acknowledge that. &nbsp;There is a profound monotonousness
about its facts that baffles and defeats one's sincerest efforts
to make them sparkle and enthuse. &nbsp;The best way to manage&mdash;in fact,
the only sensible way&mdash;is to disguise repetitiousness of fact under
variety of form: &nbsp;skin your fact each time and lay on a new cuticle
of words. &nbsp;It deceives the eye; you think it is a new fact; it
gives you the idea that the court is carrying on like everything;
this excites you, and you drain the whole column, with a good
appetite, and perhaps never notice that it's a barrel of soup made
out of a single bean. &nbsp;Clarence's way was good, it was simple,
it was dignified, it was direct and business-like; all I say is,
it was not the best way:</p>

However, take the paper by and large, I was vastly pleased with it.
Little crudities of a mechanical sort were observable here and
there, but there were not enough of them to amount to anything,
and it was good enough Arkansas proof-reading, anyhow, and better
than was needed in Arthur's day and realm. &nbsp;As a rule, the grammar
was leaky and the construction more or less lame; but I did not
much mind these things. &nbsp;They are common defects of my own, and
one mustn't criticise other people on grounds where he can't stand
perpendicular himself.</p>

<p>I was hungry enough for literature to want to take down the whole
paper at this one meal, but I got only a few bites, and then had
to postpone, because the monks around me besieged me so with eager
questions: &nbsp;What is this curious thing? &nbsp;What is it for? &nbsp;Is it a
handkerchief?&mdash;saddle blanket?&mdash;part of a shirt? &nbsp;What is it made of?
How thin it is, and how dainty and frail; and how it rattles.
Will it wear, do you think, and won't the rain injure it? &nbsp;Is it
writing that appears on it, or is it only ornamentation? &nbsp;They
suspected it was writing, because those among them who knew how
to read Latin and had a smattering of Greek, recognized some of
the letters, but they could make nothing out of the result as a
whole. &nbsp;I put my information in the simplest form I could:</p>

<p>"It is a public journal; I will explain what that is, another time.
It is not cloth, it is made of paper; some time I will explain
what paper is. &nbsp;The lines on it are reading matter; and not written
by hand, but printed; by and by I will explain what printing is.
A thousand of these sheets have been made, all exactly like this,
in every minute detail&mdash;they can't be told apart." &nbsp;Then they all
broke out with exclamations of surprise and admiration:</p>

<p>"A thousand! &nbsp;Verily a mighty work&mdash;a year's work for many men."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;merely a day's work for a man and a boy."</p>

<p>They crossed themselves, and whiffed out a protective prayer or two.</p>

<p>"Ah-h&mdash;a miracle, a wonder! &nbsp;Dark work of enchantment."</p>

<p>I let it go at that. &nbsp;Then I read in a low voice, to as many as
could crowd their shaven heads within hearing distance, part of
the account of the miracle of the restoration of the well, and
was accompanied by astonished and reverent ejaculations all through:
"Ah-h-h!" &nbsp;"How true!" &nbsp;"Amazing, amazing!" &nbsp;"These be the very
haps as they happened, in marvelous exactness!" &nbsp;And might they
take this strange thing in their hands, and feel of it and examine
it?&mdash;they would be very careful. &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;So they took it, handling
it as cautiously and devoutly as if it had been some holy thing
come from some supernatural region; and gently felt of its texture,
caressed its pleasant smooth surface with lingering touch, and
scanned the mysterious characters with fascinated eyes. &nbsp;These
grouped bent heads, these charmed faces, these speaking
eyes&mdash;how beautiful to me! &nbsp;For was not this my darling, and was not
all this mute wonder and interest and homage a most eloquent
tribute and unforced compliment to it? &nbsp;I knew, then, how a mother
feels when women, whether strangers or friends, take her new baby,
and close themselves about it with one eager impulse, and bend
their heads over it in a tranced adoration that makes all the rest
of the universe vanish out of their consciousness and be as if it
were not, for that time. &nbsp;I knew how she feels, and that there is
no other satisfied ambition, whether of king, conqueror, or poet,
that ever reaches half-way to that serene far summit or yields half
so divine a contentment.</p>

<p>During all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to
group all up and down and about that huge hall, and my happy eye
was upon it always, and I sat motionless, steeped in satisfaction,
drunk with enjoyment. &nbsp;Yes, this was heaven; I was tasting it once,
if I might never taste it more.</p>
